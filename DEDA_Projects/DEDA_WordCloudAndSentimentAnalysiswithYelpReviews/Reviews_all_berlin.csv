Al Andalus,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,7/2/12,"One of the most authentic spanish locations in Berlin.I was here on the EURO-2012 soccer final Spain-Italy, and i though i were in some Cafe in Sevilla or Madrid.No bling bling, just pure ""Spanishm"".....the yummiest Rioja wine, and a very relaxed and friendly staff.The only weakness here, is the food.....i tried the Tapas, and they were nothing empressive."
Al Andalus,Spanish,4,?11-20,1,4/23/14,"This is anything but a good spanish restaurant! You can fool the non-spanish customers, but I think that's the most disgraceful a restaurant owner can do... But you can certainly not fool a spaniard...The tapas are not freshly cooked, they taste like ""ready made"", frozen or microwaved... most of them are not even from the spanish cuisine...The worst thing is that ""thing"" they dare to call jamon... my god, that's the cheapest you could buy in any supermarket...After I read some comments from spanish people I can only guess they are friends with the owner... Never again."
Le Saint Amour,French,5,?11-20,5,9/20/15,"One of my favorites places in Berlin. It's like being back in France instantly. The place is like a typical bouchon Lyonnais, with typical dishes like quenelles de brochet. The menu is pretty short, it's all fresh and cooked on order. The house wine is ?9 a pot, and pretty good. This place cures my homesickness pretty well. Bravo et merci."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,4,11/6/15,"Very nice, affordable tapas (30 euro for two people including a bottle of wine). I only had vegetarian and fish, so can't speak for the meat plates. However, the fish was not for the picky types, so if you don't like sardines, squid etc, go for something else. If you do however, these are awesome!Bonus: The music included an instrumental spanish version of Get Lucky. There's no escape."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,2,1/15/17,"Nice interior, food is ok with cheaper prices compared to other tapas restaurant. The waiter gave us the receipt with wrong amounts of order... not as good as what I have told by my friends, would not recommend here I am sorry..."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,1,8/25/17,Not what it used to be. The food is not good anymore and if you stop ordering for 10 minutes they ask you to leave.
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,5,1/20/16,"Great little neighborhood tapas bar. The place is small, so get there early. We had the sardines, chorizos and octopus with glasses of wine. All delicious. The service is not the fastest, but we were there to savor, chat, and enjoy, so what's the rush?"
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,3,5/6/16,"Nice small and authentic Spanish restaurant. Definitely a good place to go with a group of friends, sit at a long table and enjoy the evening sharing tapas."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,5,1/20/16,A little bit of Spain in Berlin. Take some friends and a whole evening and enjoy.
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,5,7/12/15,"If you've got time, this place is amazing!! Not the quickest service, though it is friendly, and the food is sensational. Best tapas you can get in Berlin - the croquettes, meatballs, sardines and garlic prawn especially - and it's all coupled with delicious, affordable wines. Cannot recommend it highly enough!"
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,4,7/24/16,Nice tapas bar in the middle of hip Neuk?lln. Crowded and tiny insides but outside is nice. Would go back with friends!
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,3,8/1/14,"Hip, transited, no-frills Neuk?lln corner. Simple, honest tapas: rich, wonderful tortilla; great chorizo; nice boquerones; simple albondigas in tomato sauce (lacking salt); bad bread - room for improvement. Service was ok - busy night, friendly waitress knew little to nothing about the food."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,1,6/5/16,"forget about everything you read or heard about this place we've went to for years. new menu new waiters new chefs: SUPER DISAPPOINTING! the service doesn't exist no cutlery orders don't come even though asking twice. food bland unsalted ... shame what happened to that place and its vibe!"
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,4,12/17/11,"I liked Gaston, although I have already been there twice Ive not been dissapointed. Cider: Great. Wine: great. Tapas: Great. And Sebastian (the owner?) is really trying, good with people. And Im glad there are always peeps inside, seems like Im not the only one that likes it. Good luck with your venture."
Gast?n Tapas Bar,Spanish,3,?11-20,1,6/8/13,"The food here is not bad, far from the worst Spanish food I've had, but the service is terrible, and the staff disinterested and disorganised. They ignored us for two minutes when we walked in, took ages to take our order, tried to take our order a second time, bought our drinks 15 minutes later at the same time as the food, irgnored us when we tried to ask for the bill, then made us repeat our order for the bill, and then had the nerve to ask for a tip!"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/27/18,"Love love loved this place! First of all, it's adorable. Super cozy, eclectic, and very European. And our waitress was adorable also. For the food, we got the foie gras, which was a little small, but just melted in your mouth. And the truffle flatbread was to die for. The first order that came out of our escargot was badly burned--completely inedible--but when we sent it back, we got a delicious fresh order soon after with no problem at all. I definitely wouldn't drop it a star over that, especially since everything else was so perfect. Would totally come back here over and over again on future trips."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,10/9/16,"Lovely outdoor seating area and the inside ambiance is very decorated as well! Opted to sit outside on a sunny, beautiful day!It was a leisurely afternoon with a book, 2 glasses of rose wine and pasta!The rose was chilled, which made it enjoyable for a warm day and complimented well with the pasta that had a thick mushroom paste served with it. It was more than a wine bar here and I love this place superbly."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,7/22/16,"This is a great little spot if you'd like a leisurely meal or several glasses of wine. Service can be exceedingly slow, but everyone is very nice and the food is great and ideal for sharing. There are plenty of vegetarian options. The highlight was the Swiss cheese which you cut yourself and they charged you by the centimeter (and includes a ruler so you can asses your damage). The small salads were massive and delicious. And the wine list has an extensive amount of options by the glass/carafe. If you're not in a hurry, a great spot to enjoy good company and good food."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,2/3/17,"We went here two days in a row just because it is that good. And the waitress is perfect. Extremely busy but still so polite and not rushed. Food very nice. Knowledge and guidance on wine was perfect. Best recommendations."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,4/11/17,"If you want real, delicious, German food, this is your spot. Order the lunch for two, a flammenkuche, and a carafe of wine, and prepare to enjoy yourself. Beautiful patio on sunny days, and charming interior as well."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/3/17,"The food here is phenomenal. I do wish I had more time to explore the many wines they have on the menu but each time I have come here we have always been pleasantly greeted and we have tried something new on the menu."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,9/9/16,It was such a treat to find this place tucked into a cute wall in the mitte. The wine selection here is great and their cheese platters are amazing. I think I went back here almost everyday I was in Berlin. The ambience reminds you of a hole in the wall cozy french wine galerie and the service is great.
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,7/11/17,"A very cute place with great food. Very relaxed and non-pretentious, we had a mixed plate for two (which can easily be shared by 3 people, as it's so much food :-)) with a little bit of everything, and it was difficult to say what was better, as it was all yummy!"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,8/4/17,"Wonderful little spot on a quiet street. I had the chorizo flatbread with mushrooms. I don't normally like mushrooms but it was fantastic. The thinnest and crispest flatbread I've ever had. My wife got the summer salad which was a mix of delicious curry chicken and a Mediterranean salad with feta and watermelon. The watermelon was a little out of place with the chicken but it was delicious. The house white wine was great and for 17 a liter not bad at all. Service is relaxed, but hey, you're on vacation"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,8/14/15,"Located just 7 minutes walk from Gendarmenmarkt, this brasserie is perfectly situated. I came with my dad when it was piping 95 degrees outside - we were plenty hungry and tired after a whole day of sightseeing.We split the chef-selected tapas option for two (28 euros), which was an impressive assortment of German/Mediterranean dishes. The German flairs include the kitchen's preparations of potatoes, selections of cheeses, and salad dressings. The balance of vegetables to protein to carbs was just right. I think the portion is good for the warm summer nights when you don't want something heavy. If you come during the colder nights, however, I would suggest one other dish. The Weingalerie is displayed in the front of the restaurant, with each wine having its own label. The ambiance is very warm and rustic, with ample dark wood furniture everywhere."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,12/11/16,"Easily a four *Wonderful ambiance.Attentive & smiling service.Excellent wine choices.My only disagreement with the chef - my rocket salad was overdressed. Not by a horrible amount but enough to overpower the rocket & tomatoes. Next time I'll request dressing on the side."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,4/9/15,"This is the best meal that I have had since arriving in Europe in January. My boyfriend and I ordered the farmer's plate, Bavarian veal sausage, and the meal of the day, a spaghetti plate with chorizo, spinach, grated cheese, and pumpkin. I'm going to get straight to the point:-Sausage was plump and tasty without being too dense or spongey. Texture was spot on-Pretzel was buttery and delicious. The rock salt complemented the mustard perfectly, which was -Sweet and spicy, I think there was a hint of applesauce in it-Spaghetti plate was the best pasta I've ever had (including the ones I've tried in Italy). There is something so heavenly about the way chorizo pairs with sweet, mushy pumpkin-The farmer's plate had a great selection of salami, smoked prosciutto, olives, pickle onions, amazing herbed Brie, hard cheddar, dried sausage, sweet grapes, strawberries, and 2 squares of butter (which look deceptively like cheese, and so I took a bite of it and promptly spit it out. Just a warning)-We also shared the red wine tasting, and the pours are very liberal and equates to about half a bottle. Tasty and smooth, lots of pinot noirsI would definitely come back again x 100"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,12/24/16,"Love coming here when I'm over seas!! Great food amazing environmentOnly down part of this cafe is the small wait when ordering ordering food"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,2/22/16,"Such a lovely and intimate place! Order the tarte flambe with black pudding, apples and feta cheese! It's located close to Friedrichstra?e and is a great place to drink some wine, have lunch or just to have som french inspired tapas as a late night snack."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,12/1/16,"This place is definitely worth visiting - cosy, detail-oriented indoor, simply cute!4* because my standard for 5 is very heigh;) but I definitely enjoyed their escargot and flatbread:)"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,2/25/16,"My friend and I were visiting Berlin for a short time and I'm so glad we stumbled into this cafe. Of course, while in Germany, we had to have the bavarian veal sausages with pretzels and sweet mustard. The sausages by themselves (don't eat the skin) were so good, the pretzel with mustard was delicious, and eating all three together was just heavenly. I never knew I would love German food as much as I did that day. (I might have just been really hungry.)My friend also dropped half of her sausage on the floor, and our wonderful waiter brought her a new one, saying it was for ""the flying bavarian."" Hilarious and so sweet. I highly recommend this place."
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,5/23/17,"Reservations: Glad we made them because this tiny little place was packed on a week night when we arrived. They squeezed us into an intimate little corner, which was fine with us. Ambiance: eclectic and intimate setting that was great for a date, but would be fun with a small group of friends as well. Wine: really great options. they suggested one of their house whites, which we ordered a carafe of and loved! I wish I remembered what is was called, but I would definitely trust their recommendations.Food: delicious! Not a lot of large dinner options, but more small plates to share, as with most wine bars. We ordered the veal sausage and pretzel, which comes with a sweet mustard sauce. One of the best dishes we had during our whole time in Berlin. We also had the bacon wrapped prunes... these were incredible. My fianc? had the winegrowers board (mixed cheese and charcuterie) which was good but not exceptional. I had the special, which on that day was a seafood ravioli in a curry sauce, and this WAS exceptional. Once of the most unique things I tried in Berlin!"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,10/9/16,"Weingalerie is a wonderful little establishment.  The ease at which you are received is great.  The ambiance of the tucked away rooms and corners is reminiscing of old world charm.  I was lucky to get a reservation and embark  on the culinary journey with of course some wine.  We enjoyed the NO marked wine, shared a NE plate for two persons.  The NE plate filled with cheese, sausage, olives, figs among other items was plenty to accompany the wine consumed.  The kitchen looks very small.  Its a wonder they put out so much good food in a short time.  Worth the visit"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,6/14/16,"Amazing date location! The food is supposedly just tapas, but the portions are big enough to really fill you up! It's daring and experimental enough to be interesting, but not to freak out a picky eater (me). Really good food, really well put together, wine is amazing, and not all that expensive.Will be going back for sure"
Weingalerie und Caf? N?!,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/16,"We were visiting Berlin and found this gem amidst a pretty touristy area. We got the 2 person shareable plate and -WOW-... every single thing on it was awesome.PS. Don't eat the skin on the sausages! Peel it off."
Vineria del Este,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,1/28/14,"I dragged my companion here for a tapas dinner, together with several other companions. We made a reservation for 10 people, and we were seated at the very front of the room. There were several tapas on offer, each of them costing between 3 to 7 EUR. Given that they are small portions, this isn't a cheap restaurant. The bill for the whole table was around 280 EUR, and with a 20 EUR tip, it added up to about 30 EUR per person.Let me talk about the food. Oh, it is heavenly. My companion and I decided to order 8 different plates, sharing everything. I especially enjoyed the prunes wrapped in bacon. But for me, the highlight of the night was the ""ravioli"" made with finely sliced apples, folded into triangles, concealing luscious pieces of foie gras, and topped with caramelized onions. That was heaven in my mouth. In fact, I wanted to experience oral heaven again, so we ordered another plate of it.Now this is where the review gets a little tricky. I am sure that one's experience of the restaurant would be different if one went there with a smaller group. So when you have a group of ten, things can get a little chaotic. It would have been nice if they didn't combine orders, since these are tapas, and therefore it is hard to keep track who ordered what, which meant that it was also hard to keep track who would share with what combined dish. It could have been nice if they were more attentive to the table, and clear dishes when they were already empty. It wasn't a very busy night: several tables on the back room were empty, as it was a Monday. That being said, I won't penalize them too much on that, as after all, we were a big group. I'll give them 4 stars for now; but I am guessing that if I were here only with one other person, then I probably would be giving them 5."
Vineria del Este,Spanish,4,?11-20,2,5/28/17,"The food was OK. The ambience was OK. Good service, but it did not justify the price."
Vineria del Este,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,11/15/09,"Veneria del Este is a nice little Uruguay Spanish restaurant / tapas bar, with a selection of really great wines. Service is nice, busy and funny. When it's really crowded it can be a bit chaotic (tip: go during the week) but that only adds to the charm of the place; It really feels like you're on holiday here. There is always a selection of daily plates from which you can choose, plus an extensive list of tapas.Almost everything we tried here was very good, with lots of garlic, like it's supposed to be!A bit expensive for the neighbourhood (or maybe that's because we always drink too much wine!), but still affordable. If you are very hungry though and order a lot it adds up and you easily spend 60 euro with 2 persons (incl  good glass of wine per person).  Absolutely one of our favorites in this neighbourhood if we feel like some nice tapas with a good glass of wine."
Vineria del Este,Spanish,4,?11-20,3,3/6/12,"Classic tapas Bar. Good quality Food and fair if not a little high prices. The interior is a mix of second hand flea market furniture that somehow feels very Spanish. The wines are very good and of good value.The main dishes are not as good as the tapas and the menu could be refreshed once in while.A meal for 2 with a bottle of (decent)wine would cost about 70 euros."
Vineria del Este,Spanish,4,?11-20,2,4/1/14,"I'm at a total loss -- normally I find myself mostly agreeing with the yelp reviews, but this time I felt like I was living in an alternate reality. I went with two friends on a Saturday night. The place was half-full with a few little kids running around when we walked in. All fine and well, but gave the place a distinctly ""family"" feel rather than a nice place for, say, a date. It took ages for the waitress to come to our table and when she did, we could barely communicate with her. I speak decent German and was with two Germans, and all of us were having trouble. It was actually quite funny, at various points we thought she might be, how shall I say this, a little high? Like the time when she asked one of us 4 times if he wanted a large or small beer. We had to ask her to light the candle on our table, had to basically stand up and wave our arms to get her attention every time we needed something, and waited for almost 20 minutes to actually pay the bill after we first asked for it. Anyway, this all could have been saved by good food, but the tapas was totally mediocre. Several things that were on the menu were out, and everything that we tried was lukewarm and uninspired. This is nothing like the tapas I've eaten in Spain or in other, better tapas restaurants for that matter. To top it off, the bill worked out to be over 30 Euro per person, and that was without a bottle of wine. The only redeeming factor was that one of the waiters there (perhaps the manager?) was really kind and helpful, and came over to help us a few times when it was clear that the waitress hadn't noticed us or just didn't care."
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/19/15,"Amazing pizza! So huge and tasty and cheap! and the dough..... arg... the dough!It's a bit hidden but a must go place if you are around Kleistpark!!"
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/24/17,"I love this place! Amazing people, great atmosphere and the most important thing ""Food is delicious"" and not expensive.I totally recommend Olio Sale Pepe to everybody that loves italian food. If you are in Berl?n this is a must do!"
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,1,9/28/16,"The pizza is great but the service is REALLY REALLY BAD (sometimes)! sometimes they are mixing up the orders sometimes you just wait for an hour for your pizza, but today was an all time low.I had a really long hair on my pizza (in the tomato sauce) so the waitress so that I put half the pizza aside and asked what happened....professional no? NO! When I told her and showed her the hair she said...""my hair was with the hair band the entire day so it's not from me"" and left! Naturally they did and say nothing, no apology no nothing (at least say we're sorry) Great pizza, horrible service.As for the owner's replay: I've never called her stupid, I just said that it's not really a professional answer and that's a bit foolish. And The hair color was dark, my friend's hair was blonde. As I said, if she would have just said oh sorry it would have been perfectly fine. And even then, we left her 25% tip. But it's ok that you're trying to show us as ""bad rude guests"""
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/21/16,Great Pizza! The pizza was amazing! I had the Pizza Diavlo and would highly recommend it. It had just a slight spiciness which was perfection. This is a definite must if you're in the area. The waitress was great and very accommodating. Go eat here and you will be happy!
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/5/15,"Best pizza I've had in Berlin. Better than Masaniello, and cheaper. I need to try so many other things on the menu, like the seasonal mussels. I can't believe I didn't discover this place sooner as I live around the corner. I'm gonna get so fat now...damn it."
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/17/16,I came in on a Sunday night around 920 and had the best food experience I've had in 5 day of traveling. When I came in he asked what we wanted and we showed him the picture off Yelp. We sat to wait for our pizza and he offered us a drink right away and we got a couple of the Mediterranean beers and they were smooth and tastey.  Then he brought out some bruschetta. And that was delicious. After about 8 minutes our pizza came out hot n ready. When I got back to my hotel room it was a little cold but still it was so tastey me and my buddy had the whole thing in about 5 min. If you are in the area in Berlin this is the pizza place to go to. And not to mention the prices are perfect. If your in the area it's a must go but I wish we would have stayed and ate the pizza there.
OlioSalePepe,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/18/15,"Best Pizza in Sch?neberg - what am I writing? Berlin! Amazing dough, delicious, fresh topping, absolutely authentic and high quality Italian! The service is very friendly, the pricing very fair and - I never thought I would write that - their Limoncello is homemade and absolutely amazing. Love to go there and have never been disappointed."
Schwabylon,Swabian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/2/16,"The beef stew is simply amazing. The beef must have been cooked for a day or so. Super softer and rich in flavour. I could just eat the beef by itself to be honest.Furthermore, the interior is creative in all areas. A bit geeky, a bit hipster and definitely a bit crazy."
Schwabylon,Swabian,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/22/17,"The sp?tzle here was delicious but I couldn't finish mine because I went with the beef stew with red wine and it was waaaay too salty. Go with the cheese & onion, you won't be disappointed."
Schwabylon,Swabian,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/1/16,"We had to try the place just because it has an awesome name. They have several different kinds of Sp?tzle on the menu. Self service with a few tables inside and benches outside. We had the K?s Sp?tzle and it was absolutely delicious. The caramelized onion was a perfect compliment to the cheesy goodness that is underneath. As comfort food goes, the Sp?tzle here takes the price."
Schwabylon,Swabian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/29/17,"Great! Friendly service, good sp?tzle, good atmosphere, quick & affordable. I had a small portion of the beef for lunch and a rhubarb soda and it was just right."
Schwabylon,Swabian,4.5,Under ?10,3,9/26/16,"Twas all right.. i had the sp?tzle with beef stew and it was good. A nice sized portion. My boyfhad the sp?tzle with cheese but was disappointed that they used Emmenthal, and not Berg k?se.  Would have been nice to have it served with a salad or something a pretty enjoyable experience, especially in the colder months ahead!!"
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/10/17,"I was not interested in hotel food again so just saw this place near the Sheraton. Great food and service. Nice quiet place . Will definitely dine there again before leaving Berlin. Also good value"
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/17/17,"Tra Di Noi is just around the corner from the Sheraton. I ate here three times during my visit to Berlin and each time the food and service were outstanding! Since it was July, I was able to sit outside and enjoy a nice glass of wine and pizza or pasta. I was there around 7 or 8 pm each visit, and while it was busy, it was easy to find a table."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/22/17,"Just returned from Tra Di Noi with biking friends from Usa. We are staying at Sheraton and walked easily to dinner. We had two delicious cold antipasti, buffalo mozzarella and tomato and beef caprese with mushrooms to share before dinner. Each of us had different main course, all very happy with choices  Pasta  with truffles wonderful, pumpkin ravioli, salmon with broccoli, veal dish.  All of us were very satisfied. One of our guest has been in the restaurant business for year. He also was pleased with our choice of such a good place to eat within walking distance of Sheraton."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,9/24/16,"Nice little Italian spot, friendly service and good food. I ordered minestrone soup and a special of the day, pumpkin ravioli. The food was tasty and a very convenient location for a late night dinner when staying at the Sheraton Esplinade."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/8/16,"Some friends and I were spending a lazy Sunday afternoon in Tiergarten and one of us was craving some Italian food. Our search guided us to this place tucked away in a calm corner behind Lutzowplatz.We were greeted and seated by the waiter, who came a few moments later to take our orders.We ordered a Pizza and two Pastas and it wasn't long before we received our orders, which was cooked to perfection.The ambience was very nice, the food was great, and the service was excellent. Prices maybe a little up for Berlin but it's totally worth it."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/10/16,"We just wanted a place close by our Hotel and we found this incredible Italian place. All the locals were here. The amount of food they gave us was enough for three people, the price was very reasonable. We sat outside and enjoyed people watching. This place deserves 5 stars."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,10/1/16,"Quick walk from hotel Berlin or the Sheraton. Lively yet cozy. Place gets really busy for dinner but tables available. Staff is on the ball and always in motion. Sat outside. Had the pumpkin ravioli and butter sauce along with a ham pizza. Fantastic! Couple glasses of wine ""between us"" to finish out the meal."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/7/15,"The food, service and atmosphere were outstanding. The minestrone and cream of tomato soups were large portions and very good. I had black pasta with scallops, shrimp and salmon and my wife had steak tips and mushrooms in a cognac cream sauce. Both dishes were outstanding. We hope that when we get to Italy our pasta is this good. Our waiters were very good and the complimentary grappa really capped the meal off."
Tra Di Noi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/2/14,"A superb evening out! Despite being a large group of 21, arriving at the same time as a similar size group, we were served efficiently and professionally. The menu was varied and the food cooked very well. Tasted delicious. At ?37 each including 3 courses and wine, this was great value. Highly recommended."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,5,12/3/14,"Cute & cosy restaurant, perfect for dates or dinner with a friend. The service is great and the food amazing. A must eat in Mitte!"
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,4,10/11/14,"Charming little restaurant where you cannot pick what you eat. Here, it's take it or leave it. No choice, we all eat the same dishes! And of course the menu changes every day. Book ahead if you want a table (the place is small and popular)"
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,3,5/29/14,"It's a nice place, seems exclusive and romantic. The food is really good so is the wine however, it's on the pricey side contrary to what it advertises. It's a nice place to dine if you are in Mitte."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,4,9/13/12,"Looking for an only in Berlin experience then look no further than Themroc. First of all you must make reservations in advance, you can't just drop in and hope for a table at this funky little restaurant. Service will be totally informal and the furniture a little rickety, and you will eat what they serve you. If that turns you off then this isn't your type of place. If this sounds fun to you then prepare yourself for a fine meal in a rustic French style in one of the most bohemian restaurants in  Germany."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,3,4/24/13,"Having heard good reviews from friends about Themroc, I was quite excited to finally go. The staff was, at first, very friendly and informative, but I hate to say the food did not live up to the expectations. Our order was also forgotten; we waited almost 40 minutes between getting our appetizer before getting the main course and then another 20 minutes after the main course and dessert, which, unfortunately was noticeably overcooked. After asking where our food was, the staff seemed completely unapologetic about forgetting the order and the delaysI can see the charm of the establishment, but perhaps its quality is highly dependent on the changing staff and limited menu so other days could be different."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,4,5/7/13,"Friendly staff, fresh & tasty products, good atmosphere, good music."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,3,2/8/09,"Not really sure I am a fan of this concept. Limited menu, fixed times and open kitchen cooking in a small area. I found right upon entering the place that it stank of the food being prepared. Don't get me wrong, it smelled tasty and inviting initially but after a while, it became overbearing. Once they started preparing meat on the grill, it became overbearing. Further, the place is quite small and fills up. I found the quarters to be too tight and wasn't really comfortable. Finally, I found staff to be aloof and disinterested. Seems like the scene has discovered this place but it'll probably only be hot for a while until the move further on the journey through Berlin of new hotspots."
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,5,5/17/10,"Nice little cramped up place.... simple menu, simple decor, nice people working there (i heard cooks and staff change, but i went on a tuesday, so beware)... amazing to stay over dinner and keep drinking... love the simple open kitchen!!!"
Themroc,French,4,?11-20,3,10/28/10,"manages the rare feat of being hip and welcoming at the same time. great laid back atmosphere, very friendly semi-professional staff. apart from the wine it's cheap-ish. there is one menu per night, if you're lucky it's great, at worst it's average. always worth a try!"
I Golosi Briganti,Italian,4,?11-20,4,8/29/16,"This Italian place is worth the visit. The dishes are fairly cheap, and the noodles authentic. I wish they put more meat, as my dish only had a few pieces of chicken in it, but overall the place has a friendly staff, good ambiance, and affordable, authentic food."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,5/7/17,"Stop what you're doing and make a reservation at Rotisserie Weingr?n. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm talking moist, juicy, and definitely a generous portion. Rus got the pork belly, but I really preferred the chicken. We also shared a portion of mashed potatoes (which was on the smaller side). We ended the meal with the chocolate cake and ice cream. Great for sharing.We didn't make a reservation and were met with a little bit of resistance when trying to dine (despite the restaurant being nearly empty), but all of that weirdness washed away when I bit into that delicious chicken!"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,9/5/17,"Tasty, with decent service - service: 4 stars- ambiance: 4 stars- food: 3.5 starsService was friendly but felt rushed... ambiance was modern (wood interiors) and warm. Liked the table decor Food was good:- free focaccia: 5 stars -- warm and crispy on the outside, tasted homemade. - salmon: 3 stars -- was hoping for a more fatty salmon - mine was a bit dry on the inside. The presentation was great with the fire, but wasn't much savory flavor - more strongly of thyme and rosemary - sides: 4 stars -- loved the juicy corn served with butter, mixed vegetables were more like mixed bell peppers though :( not many mushrooms or zucchini- cheese plate: 3 stars? Fruit bread and the other brown bread were great but the cheeses were too potent Overall, it's hard for me to say this blew my mind since I had a similar but mind blowing menu in Iceland just a few months ago. TLDR:For my Berlin choices however, this was pretty solid. Would opt for chicken + potatoes next time though.. seems to be the more popular option?"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,8/3/17,"We had a relaxed dinner here at 7pm on a Tue. We had the combo plate (""for those who cannot decide"") which included rotisserie chicken, ribs, and pork belly. The favorite by a landslide was the ribs. The pork belly was kind of dry! :/ We also had the salmon, which was served on a plank and accompanied by an aioli that had lots of dill- very Scandinavian. This was tasty and very tender. In addition to the main entrees, we also got a combo appetizer. This had a tiny cup of gazpacho (very refreshing), some grilled octopus (delicious!), a small salad with chanterelles (sadly kind of bland), and some prosciutto. Were I to come back, I would just get the octopus. For dessert we shared the chocolate cake with melting center- i.e. old school lava cake from the 90s with a bit of ice cream. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner but weren't blown away."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,4/17/17,"Rally enjoyed dinner here and I thought the prices were very reasonable.I especially liked the pork belly. Only had the grilled veg for a side, but they had many options.Find it a bit odd that the meat comes with NOTHING on the side so you have to get some extras even if you are quite full from starters, meat itself.Service was pretty good and they speak both German and English. Mostly locals though, which is nice."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,2/22/17,"Cool Ambienace in a mix of restaurant and bar. Very central and easy to reach.The Staff is extremely quick and friendly, and the wines are tasty.I ordered the spare ribs menu here....Not the best in Berlin, but very good."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,10/31/16,"Landed in Berlin and was looking for something near our hotel in Mitte. We saw other reviews and decided to try it for ourselves. We walked in without reservations and were seated, in the back, but served nonetheless. We ordered the chicken, ribs, mashed and fried potatoes and beer of course! Another highlight of the meal was the bread that came out before our meal.  The food and service was great besides being seated in the back while the rest of the restaurant was empty."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,12/7/16,"OK. I wasn't expecting a ""life changing experience,"" but I also wasn't expecting the finest pork ribs ever and brilliantly-prepared chicken, either! We went for the ""three-for-25,"" mostly because there was just two of us and we wanted a variety of tastes (third was salmon). Great idea!!Dessert is fantastic, and so is the bread, so stay hungry before you arrive. Absolutely fantastic."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,8/1/17,"Fantastic place with great food (pork belly was absolutely out of this world!) from a carefully crafted menu. They make their own wine and juices (rhubarb) and grow vegetables on a farm in Kallstadt/Pfalz. They also own several more restaurants in Berlin: Aigner and Altes Zollhaus. Good for a casual get-together, romantic date, or any group gathering. Good quality food in the center of Berlin."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,3,12/30/16,"Food was very good, especially the chicken, but not a lot for that price. you have to get 3 courses if you are hungry (unfortunately our waitress advised us otherwise and said one main course and a side would be enough). Atmosphere was very cosy and nice, although it strongly depends on where you are seated. Sadly it was a little too obvious that they pay more attention to large groups, that are ordering bottles of champagne. We spent about 70? for a dinner for 2 with a glass of wine each (so not exactly blocking a table with a small coke and salad) but somehow the staff seemed rather annoyed had quite an attitude towards us, while chatting and laughing with other ""big-shot"" customers. maybe you have to be a regular to be appreciated at this place?overall: mixed feelings. food was good, but left us hungry and the staff and long wait for food did not make us want to order  more)"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,7/13/17,Very cool little place on next to a canal. Their food is farm to table and really very delicious. They have 2 other sister restaurants that I also ate at and should be tried as well.
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,5/23/15,"Wow oh wow!!! This place is in the Michelin guide and its v clear why.We came for dinner (without booking - I suggest you do) and they managed to give us a table for an hour and a half.The staff are v nice and service was v good but the food is (as it should be!) the star of the show. It's excellent.I tried the goats cheese with rocket and rhubarb. The goats cheese was cooked v well so it just melted in the mouth. I then went with the half rotisserie chicken - you can't be dainty eating that. The skin was crispy and salty - yum! And the meat was tender & came away from the bone without much persuasion. For dessert I had the tiramisu with marinated strawberries and an espresso. Located not too far from the TV tower, this place will not disappoint!"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,10/25/16,"Amazing food! My father and I were in Berlin looking for somewhere off of the beaten tourist track, and we were not disappointed! The portions are large, the flavor abundant and it seemed as though actual Berlin residents dined there. We were the only people speaking English in the restaurant, which was exactly what we were looking for.The ambiance is fairly intimate as well, and the service was excellent. I would recommend the Crispy Pork Belly entree to even the harshest of food critics. Hope to return the next time I'm in Berlin!"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,10/9/16,"The talk about life changing dinners experienced here are not by exaggeration.  The service is great.  The food is much better than that.  Lucky and I mean lucky we were to get a reservation.  I am surprised at how unassuming this place is. This establishment could be anywhere else and be successful.  It is that good.  The goodness began with the bread paired with pumpkin oil butter.  Next the rhubarb salad to share was a nice little surprise.  We shared the two person meat plate, steak, chicken and ribs.  Everything was awesome.  Ribs, perfectly seasoned and accompanied by homemade BBQ sauce.  The chicken was brined nicely and needed no seasoning.  The steak cooked perfectly.  I waste no words here.  The food is great.  Desert was also pretty nice.  All in all worth the visit to Berlin just to eat here!!!!"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,3,6/14/16,"My kind of food, as I'm a dedicated carnivore bordering on cave man -- kind of a sparse menu but all the basics are there, so there's something for everyone -- even a vegetarian risotto option. I chose the beef and it was good -- almost as good as the bernaise sauce that came with it -- my wife chose the salmon it was even better (flamb?!).The atmosphere is cool but the tables and chairs are uncomfortable. Again, Spartan, in a way that doesn't really suit a big American but gives you that cost-conscious design feeling that is so Berlin. I don't mean that in a good way. The wait staff was equally German -- they hate letting customers pay in a timely fashion."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,9/19/16,"Highly recommend their excellent pork ribs and killer sauce on the side.  How to describe the sauce:  comes in small metal container served very warm, made from pork stock, light tomato, onion/red pepper dices, slightly sweet, not thick, not vinegary like some US Southern style recipes.  One serving is 3 large and very moist and meaty ribs.  Within 10 minutes walk from the Courtyard hotel on Axel Springer Strasse.   Farm style interior with wood and metal tables and chairs with high barrel brick ceiling.  Tables spaced nicely with room between.  Outdoor wrap around patio when weather is warm.In addition to ribs we had the thin sliced ham (like in Spain) with shredded horseradish and small gherkin pickle chunks and 2 paddies of butter (Bergschinken). Grilled vegetable side with cut zucchini, red pepper, onion and small green mild chili peppers with nice black roasting marks.  Meal also comes with small plate of green olives and focaccia type bread and brown bread slices.  Didn't much care for the mayonnaise like spread that came with the bread.  Had glasses of house Pinot for ?9 glass which was pleasant although light.  Total bill for two with 2 rib entrees, appetizer, 2 vegetable sides, bottle of sparkling water and 3 glasses of wine ran ?83.  Entrees are standalone with all sides costing extra (grilled vegetables, salad, roasted potatoes, and mashed potato with brown butter, for example.Other tables were having steak, flaming salmon filet and pork and lamb dishes which all looked very good.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Very tasty and satisfying meal in Berlin city center area."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,6/12/15,I did not think I would get such a nice meal in Berlin.  Local German farm to table food.  Everything here was good and the staff was very nice and welcoming.  They have a BBQ sampler plate you can get if you want to try a few different things.  I would highly recommend this place if you are staying in Berlin and would like a nice meal with local wines or beer.
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,4,9/7/15,"Very good restaurant with german specialties and grilled meat. My mixed grill was good, especially the chicken. The lamb looked delicious. And my ceasar salad was very good too."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,7/22/15,"Amazing Rotisserie on Berlin!Very upscale feeling and great and amazing flavors. Everything looked and tasted fantastically meat is of fantastic quality and so was everything else. The service is also great and there's a nice selection of wines from different locations to choose from.It's a not a particularly big restaurant so it can be a little noisy but there's very interesting people here. Good for families and groups.Watch out for the fire burning dishes here :)"
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,5/24/15,"Gets a mention in the Michelin guide. One of the best meals we had while on holiday. It has a lovely feel to it with friendly staff not from Museum Island.The food was wonderfully prepared, well seasoned and the octopus was tender which is seldom the case.The lamb shank just fell apart and I sucked the bone clean. Started to fill up quickly so book a table in advance."
Rotisserie Weingr?n,Barbeque,4.5,?21-40,5,5/4/15,"Simply amazing. My wife and I stumbled onto this restaurant after walking around Berlin all day and saying, ""We're feeling hungry. Let's find a restaurant. How about this one?""Service was outstanding. They had free olives on the table before we arrived (yummy). They tried to bring bread, which looked delicious, but we had to decline (due to my wife's gluten allergy). They were prompt with bringing menus, bringing drinks, taking the food order, bringing the food, taking the dessert order, making dessert table side, and bringing the check. Three different servers helped us, and they all spoke plenty of English to help us (our German is lousy).Menus were available in English, including a huge wine list. We explained the gluten allergy, and we were assured that most things were naturally gluten free, and they would be happy to work with us. We ordered a bottle of water, the house red wine, roasted chicken, steak, a side of roasted vegetables and a side of mashed potatoes. The sides were served family style for sharing. All of the food was outstanding, especially the sides. The steak was a bit overpriced, but still delicious.For dessert, the server was on the ball telling us about the one gluten-free option, which was basically a creme br?l?e. They finished it at the table with a torch, and there was a berry compote to put on top. Plus, I got some fantastic coffee on the side.We left this restaurant totally full and totally happy. It was expensive, but worth every last euro."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/3/15,"As I waited for my friend to copy our resumes to begin the job hunt in Berlin, I stumbled across a bustling middle eastern eatery. There are of course many like this one all throughout Berlin, serving kebabs, shewarma and felafel. Most of the time I try to use location based apps to find the nearest top rated foods, but this was a spur of the moment, no expectations decision.I was drawn to the 1.50 euro falafel as I wasn't too hungry and not looking to spend a pretty penny. As I ordered, the jolly man on the other side of the counter carved out several balls of fresh chick pea mix and they sizzled excitedly as they were submerged in the deep fryer. I could already sense this was to be no ordinary meal. I waited patiently as more and more local middle eastern customers flocked through the doors. They knew something about this place.The jolly chef raised the glistening golden brown balls from their oil bath and placed them inside a wrap of toasted pita bread. He then topped it off with the freshest onions, tomato, chilli and sauces. I walked outside and sat down on a concrete bench as this experience required full seated attention.*MUNCH*The first bite exploded in my mouth with the most vivid of flavours. The falafel was cooked to absolute perfection, melting in my mouth after making my way through the soft crunch of the outer shell. Every bite got increasingly better as the individual flavours made themselves noticed. The kryptonite green chilli was the necessary addition that I didn't know I needed, until the juices were bursting from every bite. I lay back on the bench with a look of satisfaction that could not be faked by even the finest poker player. I headed straight back to the counter to order another. I need to make it clear that I wasn't hungry.. I just craved that experience one more time. I was not disappointed.."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/30/17,"Literally the best falafel I've ever had in my life!! My friend and I shared the vegetarian platter and we were so full. It was just 5 euros too. Everything in the platter was delicious, but the falafel in particular was out of this world!!! It was so different from the falafels I'm used to. It's crunchy on the outside. And these falafels are HUGE! My friend lives in Berlin and this is her favorite place to eat. Come here if you have the chance, you won't regret it."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/23/16,"Yelpers are not wrong! I am glad i came to Al-Andalos. We came on a Sunday and you will find a lot of restaurants in this area open on a Sunday. We were served very quickly and both my husband and I ordered the shawarma with chicken and all the trimmings (we didn't ask for anything different) and it was our first time here. It is 1.50 ? each which is so cheap plus filling! We ordered a coca cola and in total it was 4 ? - BARGAIN! As soon as you bite into the wrap, you can taste the grilled chicken with the juicy sauce and hit of garlic. The tomato and lettuce give the shawarma freshness and the flavours were just melt in your mouth!This is my first shawarma in Germany, but we have a lot of shawarma's in Australia which I absolutely love - we call them kebabs. I recommend coming here for a quick bite to eat. Plenty of seating at the back."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/13/17,"Absolutely delicious!   The al-andalos meat plate was a sampler of all things fine in the world.  Simply put, you can't go wrong with it.  A fresh homemade falafel, lamb, chicken, sausage, lentils, rice, bread and so on.  You won't be disappointed.  The staff were very friendly and the food was served quick and hot.  This place Vegan and vegetarian friendly"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/22/16,"For a second day in a row, I didn't bring lunch to the office. So again I went somewhere new to find a new place to eat. This one is a little far from where I work, but nevertheless, going here was totally worth it. The area reminds me more of Ramallah than Berlin. In fact, I might as well be in the middle of Beirut. The signage were in Arabic and German, yet the language you hear is more the former than the latter.You line up, wait until the guys behind the counter ask for your order, and wait. You can get a quick sandwich (a wrap, not the traditional Western notion of two pieces of bread with a filling in between), or you can do what I did, which was order a platter for one (6 EUR; a platter for 2 costs 11 EUR), which is a sampler of the multiple different things they feature on the window.Things here are a little slow (1 minute turned out to be 10 minutes, just like in the Middle East), but who cares? Have a little patience, and good food will eventually come in a platter for you to enjoy. There's a large dining room on the back, so if the street tables are full, or the front room is a little too hot (especially in the middle of summer), then there's a place to escape."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/12/17,"My friend and I split the 1-person vegetarian platter as well as the two-sandwich combo for a total of 7 euro. It was so delicious but we couldn't finish it all, we were so full. So much food for so little money!"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/26/16,"Probably the best falafel in the city.. The 1.5 Eur warp is the best in the city fot the price.The spicy potatoes & spinach is also wonderful but more on the non spicy side."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/2/15,"I tried Alanduls-Teller for two, also tried Falfel Teller and Shawrma sandwich.All were tasty and good price.Service is good as well. I liked the Falfel there the most.Recomended."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,3,6/23/16,"Came by for a late lunch. I got the vegetarian plate, which was huge and cheap. The falafel was fantastic. Hummus was decent. The rest of the food was so-so. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The drink selection was good. There are only a few small tables, it's more popular for take away."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/8/17,"I ordered the falafel plate and it was such an amazing deal. It came with vegetables, hummus, 7-8 giant pieces of falafel, and bread to wrap everything in. And for only ?4! It fillled up a whole plate, enough for 3-4 wraps if you eat it that way. I ate half and was stuffed, tried to eat more later and was still so full from the first time that I couldn't finish it before my flight sadly :( I will always compare falafel to this from now on, it was so good! My only complaint is that the hummus was too salty, everything else was perfect though"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/21/15,"I think my review is probably going to be redundant.After the full star reviews and the wonderful photos, what does a true Yelper do? Locate the place and order the most recommended dish.Al-Andalos is located in the busy part of Neuk?lln, right on Sonnenallee. On a Saturday night at 10 p.m., it was full to the rim. No seats, stressed out staff, people fight for seats and the spot in the line to get the delicious food.We ordered the Al-Andalos platter for two (meat) for 11 EUR, which comes with an entire package of Arabic/Lebanese bread. We were barely able to finish the entire plate, there are many tasty things on this plate and even my companion that night, who is generally not so quickly to impress, admitted that it was probably the best he has eaten in a long time.Fresh, tasty, large portions and fair prices. Staff is super friendly and attentive!I think I will have to drive out to Neuk?lln more often!"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/13/14,"I want to fly back to Berlin just to have this food! Found it on Yelp while looking for a place to meet friends. It is a place not to be missed! We shared a large family style plate that stuffed us all for 18E and had plenty leftover. I wish I could say what it was but we really just pointed at a plate a bunch of other people already eating there were sharing. Good: tons of food, cheap, delicious, wide array of food on large platter, clean and open cafe, outdoor seating, fast to serveBad: couldn't finish the plate, might be hard to find"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,3,1/28/16,"This place is OK but not the best.If you want to eat something for cheap, go there. They serve normal shawarma and falafel for 1.5 Euro. All other food are also underpriced.Worth to try."
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/24/15,"One of the best for middle eastern food in the area.The Humus is neither to soft, nor to sticky...and tastes just like I know it from Jerusalem.The people behind the counter are quick and friendly, and take care of any extra wishes you might have."

Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/25/15,"Wow!! I have been living for 4 years in Neuk?lln and I heard many things about this place, but for some reason or another, I never managed to go. Now that I don't live there anymore, I was passing by today, dying of hunger but yelp never let me down and having so many 5 stars I decided to stop by and.. WOW.. that's all I can say.Nowadays it's trendy to give customers very little food (sometimes, tasteless) for really high price.. it's like all the restaurants in the surrounding are in war to see who gets more expensive and hipster.. I am so glad this place keeps very low price while offering tasty, delicious and a very fulfilling amount of food. Seriously, probably one of the most inexpensive and best places in Berlin!"
Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/27/16,"Delicious, fresh and cheap Lebanese food. All sandwiches (wraps) are only 1.5?. Offers both non-vege and vege meals.

Al-Andalos,Food Stands,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/22/16,"Do not go here for the ambiance (because you will not find much). The interior is quite dark and has these little backrooms with no windows.

Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,8/18/17,"Although I am still discovering Berlin Biergartens, I am thrilled to share such a positive recommendation!! The beer selection is beyond reproche, the staff is super friendly and welcoming, the setting is absolutely perfect (even for being so close to a busy intersection and street. What won me over is that the food is solid! Plainly said, it's good brewpub food! I wish that other biergartens in Berlin took note!I'll be back!"
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/6/17,"For the country that taught me everything about beer, I could not believe that I stumbled upon a American-style craft brew pub right near my friend's apartment in Berlin!  It really is American-style, and it succeeds.  The chalkboard is the biggest dead-ringer.  I can understand why they would want to try the model out in Germany; they like beer in Germany, so why not.The beers I tasted were all excellent.  The German IPA was definitely the tastiest one.  The service was good, too."
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/31/17,Great selection of interesting beers. Each of them very tasty. One thing I didnt like was that you can't choose each of your tasters if you order a flight. They are already chosen for you. Other than that it was a pretty busy place with nice outdoor seating. I dig it!
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,4,8/31/16,"Took a large group here, and was impressed with both food and service. We were served a set menu of perfectly baked chicken and very flavorful couscous. Our starter was a cold tomato and mozzarella soup, and I had never had anything like it, but found it light  and refreshing. Finished with a fluffy key lime mousse with pineapple and red currants on top.Overall, a pleasant experience, and would go back to sit in the biergarten to sample the many varieties of beer!"
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,3,4/5/16,"I wanted to give a higher rating for this restaurant, I really do. Except the server was super rude it almost ruined the experience.We were a party of three, with a reservation. We were seated inside, and were given the beer booklet as well as the food menu. This German-speaking Russian server took our orders. Now, if your customer has questions, then make the best effort to answer them. If your customer is lactose-intolerant, then make the best effort to change the ingredients in the most possible way. We weren't asking for a miracle, just a small request to remove the mayonnaise from the pulled pork sandwich. Yes, I know that there is no lactose in mayonnaise, but regardless, one in our party still don't like it. Nevertheless, it came with mayo, and so we sent it back. It would have been nice if this server listened to what we were saying. Instead, she was busy being patronizing and pretentious. It's almost like we were doing her a big inconvenience by giving her our order, when it was actually her own job. The chips were great, the burger was okay. Not my best burger, but otherwise, it was good regardless. If I were to give an itemized rating, it would be as follows:Chips/Fries: 5 starsBurger: 4 starsBeer selection: 5 starsInterior: 4 starsBlond-haired Russian server: 1 starI should say that I was glad other servers came up to our table later. When we sent back the pulled pork, it came quite promptly. The others were quite friendly. Seriously though, if I weren't alone tonight, I would have walked out."
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/12/17,"Solid spot for big groups with an awesome selection of beers and delicious schnitzel. The back room gets pretty loud in the evening when it's full, so don't expect a quiet meal. Our waiter was curt, but service was prompt. I'd definitely recommend Dolden for the beer and the schnitzel."
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,4,5/7/17,Excellent veggie burgers. Great selection of beer. The fries were suprisingly good. Wonderful service. They also accept credit cards.
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,2/22/16,"Great stop if you are missing American style craft beer bars. In Berlin, most bars only have one beer on draft and the rest bottled. This gem has twenty beers on tap from all over the world including the US! The English speaking bartender was very nice and helpful! Large place that seems good for groups."
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,3/6/16,"Great place, good beer, friendly staff, good food. Just a little on the pricey side though! I will definitely go back."
Dolden M?del,German,4.5,?11-20,5,11/27/16,"Beer flight with cheese is recommended. Hearty food, some bio/pastured meat options. Waiters/waitresses have always been polite, tolerating our bad German (most speak English.) Warm atmosphere inside, with a pleasant outdoor patio."
Anadolu Grill,Kebab,4.5,?11-20,5,10/20/17,"By far THE BEST doner in Berlin. The toppings are fresh, the sauce is perfectly spiced, meat is delicious, and the bread...sooo good."
Anadolu Grill,Kebab,4.5,?11-20,4,7/16/13,1a Lamm und Bohnensuppe. Service wirkt leider wenig bem?ht und etwas genervt. Also lieber mitnehmen
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/26/18,"There's a reason this place is the best. There's a reason that we went out of the way for this place. They do have some of the best doner kebabs that I have ever had. Mind you this wouldn't be my first pick for a meal ever but my wife insisted. She made me a fan. These were delicious. This is a tiny little place but they are super friendly and welcoming. There's even Turkish tea if you'd like. Everything is cooked up fresh and it's super tasty. I can see why we made the trek to find the location."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/16/17,Loads of fresh veggies and tasty chicken! This spot has dethroned all in one kebap as my favorite in the city. It's well worth the trip to try.
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/11/16,"One of the best doener kebab in berlin! The chicken kebab here was well roasted and well spiced. The sauce was great and the salad was very fresh. The potatoes were well seasoned. Overall, better than Mustafa's. A bit pricier but well worth itThey really put the heart into making each doenner. Unlike most reviews here, My only complaint is about the bread which I think the bread was not that well toasted. Could have been better. Maybe because it was during a peak hour? Or maybe because I didn't eat it right away? (I got it to go)Prepare to wait for a bit ... But they will tell you know how long the wait is gonna be when you pay. Basically go right to the cashier, pay, get a number and wait for your number. I appreciate that they have nice proper seatings unlike mustafas where you have ti stand there waiting in the rain, in the snow or in the cold wind"
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/13/17,"Best late night kebab decision ever. Less than 5 euro for a huge wrap, fresh meat, delicious sauce options. They were busy but got our order within 2-3 minutes."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/25/17,This was the best meal we had in Berlin!  Great food. Great service. Grab to go beers next door and you eat for $4 each person. The owner (??) was very kind and wanted to make the meal an experience. Do not miss this stop in Berlin. Don't turn away if the line looks long. It goes fast.
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/14/16,The Gemus chicken with all three sauces is delicious. Served in a light a fluffy sesame pita. The service is friendly and lines move quickly despite only having one cashier. Affordable place and all you can drink hot Turkish tea is on the house. Perfect for a quick and flavorful lunch.
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/24/17,"Fabulously diner kebab- I got the wrap, which is HUGE (and at 4.50 Euros - a fantastic value) - nearly a foot long, with a good balance of meat, veggies and sauce. Everything was fresh tasting and I was completely satisfied. Friendly staff that speaks English."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/29/17,"Great veggie d?ner, and unlike Mustafa's in Kreuzberg, they give you a number so you don't have to stand in line, which is nice. But is it worth waiting 40 minutes for a d?ner? Maybe, maybe not."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/2/17,"BEST D?NER KEBAB IN BERLIN (or possibly on Earth)!! This place's d?ner is so good that my friends and I eat here every Monday, D?ner Montag! I've been to quite a few d?ner kebab restaurants in Berlin, and only R?ya makes their d?ner with such amazingly seasoned vegetables and potatoes. The portions are huge for a cheap price. The vegetarian d?ner is 3.60 Euros. There's also free hot tea! The staff is super friendly. Sometimes, one of the staff carries a lightsaber around and threatens you with ""death"" unless you answer his questions carefully. The only slight downside I can think of is that this place is so popular that you may have to wait about 20-30 minutes even on a Monday evening. But, trust me, the wait is SO worth it!!"
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/28/16,A very good Kebab that certainly is better than your average round the corner Kebab. I liked the different kind of veggies they use and also the salad topping is spot on. The only thing that I would change are the sauces. I chose the spicy sauce but it had some too sweet elements in it. Still overall very delicous.
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/7/17,"Definitely one of the best Doner spots in Berlin. The doner is always consistent and flavorful. Anyone I have taken here has become an instant fan. Small store but seating is usually not an issue as seats clear out while you wait for your food to be prepared. Also, the staff is very friendly."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/9/16,The meat is just of great quality. The veggies are fresh. Also the sauces are aromatic and spicy! I love it. I highly recommend the plate with rice. The only disadvantage is that the prices got up. Also during the weekends or rush hours you have to wait a bit longer.  At least you can be sure everything is freshly prepared for you!
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/17/15,"The owner and employees love their job and make great food. Perfect place for a good, satisfying meal!"
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/30/16,"Best Kebab i've ever had, loved the vegetarian version. I highly recommend this place!!!"
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/17/15,"This belongs to the select few kebab places that really are tops in Berlin.  It's one of the few where the meat really tastes like meat!  The sauces were all delicious and I love how they have 3 different kinds of powdered chile you can add yourself!  The extra spicy is ACTUALLY extra spicy so be careful with that one...even if you do get it down, you'll remember it the next day. I've been trying to taste as many as possible here in Berlin and with a few exceptions am almost always slightly disappointed, (after having tried mustafa's). This one made me fall in love with kebab all over again!  Ranks as high if not higher!  Absolutely delicious. I guess I'd have to try them side by side."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/28/15,"Great place, i argue its as good or even better than the famous Mustafa.Warning about waiting time: You might also wait 20-30 minutes here if coming during busy hours.BUT you dont have to wait static in line, they take your order quickly, you get a number and an estimate of how long it will take, then you can walk around for a while or have a tee cup (free!) while waiting."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/17/15,Excellent place for a quick bite at a most reasonable price. Owner and the others look like they really enjoy serving quality food.
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/7/15,"Definitely one of the best kebabs in town, always delicious!Some fresh mint, crumbled feta cheese and a squeeze of fresh lemon make this a deluxe (and quite filling) kebab experience.Friendly staff."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/20/14,"Best kebab in Berlin! On top of that the staff is super friendly and helpfull. One can tell they make each kebab with love. Before I used to go to Mustafa's gemuse kebab, but after discovering R?ya I never went back."
R?yam,Kebab,4.5,Under ?10,3,10/2/14,"Hovering allowedThe Germans have taken the Kebab to their hearts and the gem?se (vegetable) kebab in particular. R?ya is apparently one of the best, so father-in-law decided quite emphatically that we try it out. The Rules: Order first then be prepared to hover to jump on an outside seat when free. But be aware, it's not first come first served on the seat front. You need to be fast! The options: Either chicken or vegetable kebab on fluffy bread, a wrap or with rice. 15 mins later your number comes in. We opted for one chicken on fluffy and one Gem?se with rice and set amongst these monsters like animals. To Brits much of this Turkish delight will be familiar, but with slight differences. The bread is thick and fluffy fresh and served with crisp salad; the sauce is a dill yogurt/mayo or a chilli ketchup and you get a crumbly sharp feta cheese on top! Indeed the chicken kebab was a delight, but the veg one was basically fried diced mushy potato and aubergine and really quite greasy and not as healthy as it sounds :(  Service is friendly in this no frills imbiss (cafe, come take away) and you get free unlimited tea with your ?3.90 meal. It can take a little while to get your order, but that's coz they're so busy. It's definitely recommended, but unless you're a potato freak stay clear of the veg one."
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/12/17,"The best hospitality I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Mario - one of the brothers who runs this place is such a pleasant person. When his brother is cooking he talks to each and every guest and takes his time taking orders and serving. After his brother leaves he takes over and serves the food as well. The food was so good. He offered a desert wine and espresso at the end. Visiting this place was the highlight of my trip to Berlin. Mario even walked every guest to the door after they finished while we were there. Eat at this place to have a pleasant time, if you are in a hurry and want to be on your phone this is not the place. I like how the restaurant tries to keep technology out while we enjoy our meal."
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/29/16,Considering price and quality you will have a great evening here. Homemade food and great friendly service.  Anti past can be shared and the prosecco does the trick.
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/16/17,"Excellent supper. From the beginning you feel welcome and appreciated. The server runs the place with his brother, and it's clearly something they really believe in. We had gnocchi and a pasta dish, along with a mozzarella/tomato appetizer, and some wine. All the food was exactly what I'd want for that dish. The prices were very good, with the main dish prices low enough that you feel like getting that appetizer or two. All the ingredients that are supposed to be fresh were fresh and delicious. What else is there to say?"
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,5/13/13,Also ich finde das Essen nichts Besonderes Italiener hat keine Pizza und Penne war nicht herausragend Nur wenn ich muss wieder
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,6/4/17,"My boyfriend and I found this restaurant through a travel blogger on Pinterest. We were looking for reasonably priced food that was still authentic and delicious (obviously the most important). We jumped on the train from our hotel to Papa Pane di Sorrento.When we got there we grabbed a spot outside on their patio. It is in a nicer area and neighborhood of Berlin, so we were able to watch the people are cars go by on a quiet Tuesday night. They had an English menu which was fantastic, but our waitress didn't speak any English. Turns out ""pizza, beer, and wine"" is a universal language for everyone though! We both got our own pizzas which was a little too much food for us, you could probably split one for two people. Also, remember that in Germany they cut everything while they eat it, so don't be a stupid American and eat your slices with your hands!I would give this restaurant 6/5 stars if I could. It was such an excellent stop during our trip, I highly recommend!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,5/6/17,"This place is very busy, regardless of the day, but especially so on weekends. Regardless, it is definitely worth the wait. The interior is small, a bit loud and a bit cramped. There seem to be too many tables crammed into the inside and there's no waiting area for customers. That's the bad, everything else is fantastic. Service was good and our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. What you came for, the food, is very good. My party all had pizza, which was the best Italian-style pizza I have had in a long while. I saw one review said the bottom side of the crust was not crispy enough. While I would agree, it didn't detract from the quality or taste of the pizza, in my opinion. I had the salami pizza and the people with me had the spinach and ricotta. Both were well made and delicious. Definitely worth a visit! I wish I had more time in Berlin so I could return and try something else."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,3,9/17/17,"Papa pane was introduced to me as one of the best pizza place in Berlin but it is more than a pizzeria. They also serve respectable pastas. It is a bit weak on the antipasto/appetizer though. Wines are well priced so a good option. The place can be very busy so reservation really helps otherwise you may have to wait for quite a while before 8:30/9:00 pm. Overall, pizza is a better bet over pasta."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,2/28/17,"I decided to come here for my birthday so I booked a table in advance because we were quite a big group. The restaurant is located just a few minutes away from Rosenthaler Platz.This place is super italian. Only italian waiters, white and red checked table cloths and it's pretty loud and crowded inside. We all went for pizzas and they're all very good and affordable as well. House wine was good as well!Service was really friendly, food was good and the ambiance was also enjoyable. Can definitely recommend this restaurant if you're on the hunt for a nice Italian place. Be aware that it's a little bit more on the pricy side for Berlin standards."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,3/12/16,"One of my favorite pizza places in Berlin. Pizza, pasta, fish dishes, amazing deserts - everything is supper yummy. Great selection of Italian wines. Great for groups and families with kids. They have kids size pizzas! Place is always full, so call in advance to reserve a table. Service can be a little bit slow, but with all the people to serve it's understandable. House wine (red or white) is what I usually drink with my vegan Marinara pizza."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,1,9/20/17,I would give this zero stars if I could. We tried to come here for an early evening dinner. We were seated but our hostess was VERY rude and seemed annoyed that we had even walked through the door. We sat at our table while two servers argued back and forth about setting up different reservation tables and completely ignored us for about 10 minutes. After the attitudes and the rudeness that was shown we felt unwelcome and decided to leave. I guess if you're American DO NOT go here!
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,2,9/4/17,"Good pizza, bad service! Overwhelmingly loud! They have mixed our orders several times!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/16/15,"Amazing amazing amazing experience! We walked past and got a table after a very nice couple moved so we could sit 5. The atmosphere was autentic and immediatly we knew this was gonna be good. Classic but yet not ""boring"" menu. Then the food arrived. Oh. My. God. The pasta with asparagus and truffle is a must try, but everything else we got was amazing as well. The waiters was fun and managed the crowded restaurant effectively. This restaurant is worth a trip!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,3,3/11/17,Good house wines and younger (20'and 30's) crowd. Crowded and noisy. Pizza was not crispy enough. The servers had too many tables - asked for a napkin and never arrived - forgot our drink order. Almost authentic food but simple things like fresh pepper would make it nicer. Good value on prices. Made a reservation but was useless. - they put 5 of us on a small table for four.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,4/29/17,"Great spot! Highly recommend a reservation, as it gets quite busy and there isn't much room where you can wait. The pizza and appetizers were fantastic, as was the service. And even though it was full, we never felt rushed. Go here! You won't be disappointed :)"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,2/29/16,"Such amazing, authentic Neapolitan pizza at an amazing price! The pizzas are huge - falling off the big plates - and they are mostly under ?10! Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The menu is first in Italian and then German. Not much English spoken, which contributed to accidentally buying a ?5 bottle of water. We went here because celebrities like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are here, and now I see why! If you want the best pizza in Berlin, look no further!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,4/21/16,"Was taken there for a business/informal lunch. I was ordered a custom pasta with truffle and ham. It was super delicious. The restaurant is in a very nice building, the interior is a mix of elegant and simple italian style."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,1,8/11/16,"We went with kids to Papa Pane , we have to wait 40 minutes for our pizzas on a lunch time , waiter was overbooked, and she does not seem at all to be embarrassed for us. Quality was average, so no worth waiting that much. TOO MUCH olive oil on the pizzas :("
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,2/14/16,"One of the authentic italian pizza place in center of Berlin. Reservation is must as this place is always full.During our first visit , tried Pizza Papa Pane ( vegetarian ) and Panna Cotta ( Dessert ) , both were very delicious.Pizza size is really big , do order first ( good for 2 people ) and later go for second based on hunger left :)Highly recommended"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,3/31/16,Went here when I was in Berlin and had a wonderful meal! Delicious carbonara and salami pizza. Also very well priced and nice staff!
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/11/15,"My boyfriend and I decided this is our favorite Italian place in the neighborhood. The pizza is yummy and the pasta dishes are too. Wine good, salads too. Fair price. Service comparable to the rest of Berlin. Pasta with asparagus and truffle oil amazing!   It's lively inside and pleasant to sit outside when weather permits."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,3,8/25/15,The place smelled inside like an ashtray. Smokers right outside allowing smoke to drift inside. The pizza was okay. The crust was too thick and the rest was too soft and wouldn't hold up. The lasagna was good. Service was okay as well. We went for lunch I would say 1/3 full.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,2,2/5/15,"Once upon a time it was a place with good pizza for reasonable prices with a nice italian flair....those times are over...pizza is still good...prices raised and service...well ehm...there is no service anymore...but a motto...eat fast, leave tip and go...dishes coming not the same time...they starting taking the plates away before EVERYone is finished...so if your touristguide tells you to go there...go ahead...it is a touristplace with touristtreating right now...not such a nice place for pizza in berlin like it was..."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,4,12/19/13,Great italien place with a lunch menu that almost seems like a steal. Especially the homemade pasta is great.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4,?11-20,5,8/5/15,"Delicious bruschetta, I loved the juicy tomatoes on the homemade bread. The Pizza with spinach was just as Pizza should be. So happy to eventually have found a great Pizzeria in Berlin. Staff was friendly, and the location is central. I sat outside on one of these warm summer nights."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,10/17/17,Amazing pizza and good service!  I really enjoyed their white pizza:)
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,4,8/9/16,"Really good pizza and friendly, efficient service. A little out of the way but in an interesting part of town. Bring cash--they don't accept cards."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,4/14/17,"as good as it gets in berlin, proper service, top notch pizza, decent wine"
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,8/10/14,"YUM X 2!It's right around the corner from where I live, and it's been fantastic both times. I had the bacon cheese and cheery tomato pizza (can't remember its name), my friend had the vegetarian tofu one, and my other friend had the last one on the menu with the goat cheese and onions. THAT one might have been my favorite, though I couldn't help but order the same bacon one twice. The first time it felt like 23 years before the pizzas came, so I was going to give a less than perfect score, but tonight, it came in about 5 seconds, so they made up for it. When I asked for my second glass of tap water, they brought me a pitcher which was nice. I had the tiramisu for dessert tonight - perfect size - just a little thing in a cup. Not the most amazing I've ever had, but pretty good, light, and hit the spot just fine. The servers are super sweet and I look forward to my next time. A lovely patio for a summer's evening.Oh, and, should I feel terrible smiling at this? One of the servers asked this American dude to speak more softly. ;)"
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2/14/15,"The best pizza I've had in recent memory. I had blood sausage with apple slices, and it was truly delicious."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,12/26/15,"Probably our favorite pizza place in the Kiez. From the outside or inside you would never know it. It feels like a rather Spartan bar in southern Germany. And one should not expect classic individual sized pizzas like at the true Italian places. But the pizzas are fantastic. Quality ingredients, huge portions, lots of vegetarian options. Also generally not gloppy or greasy. We usually order one pizza and one salad and split both, with the salads really good as well. Try the beer from South Tyrol. Also be sure to reserve. This place is no longer a secret and even weekdays get crowded."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2/25/15,"Best pizza in Berlin, maybe the best I have ever had. I am missing this place right now."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,4/26/14,"Nice place, and excellent pizza! I had the vegetarian pizza with potatoes and smoked tofu, and my boyfriend had the one with blood pudding and some other kind of meat. Very weird, and extremely tasty! The pizzas are big and filling and the best Berlin can offer. Good service too. We'll be back!"
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,1,12/8/14,"I was approached by the owner for not ordering enough food and having a glass of free tap water, instead of a beer or soda. He ruined the experience before the food even came to the table. I felt like i was there just to earn him money, like I wasn't a person. After he left the waitress came over and made us feel worse. There seemed to be no understanding that going to a restaurant is about more than just eating food. I wouldn't recommend going here."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,5/3/12,"A great place to bring family when they are in Berlin. It has a spacious well-designed interior, which never seems to get too loud to drown out your voices. The tables are large and good for conversation. The food is great: pizzas -not exactly Italian in character, since they have ingredients like Alpine cheese, cr?me fraiche, rucola, speck and mushrooms which are enormous and you can split. Very good wine by the glass. Daily menu with soups and enormous salads with fresh herbs. There's a little terrace and Kegelbahn in the basement. Book ahead."
Figl,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,11/18/12,"einfack lecker, k?nnte etwas gem?tlicher sein"
Buscaglione,Cafes,5,?11-20,5,1/25/16,"This place is an absolute gem. I feel so lucky that Buscaglione is right across the street from where I live. I'm addicted to the way Nea makes my coffee, and she's sweet as can be. The pastries are also incredible (great croissants + pasteis de nata!).I think the shop has a lot of loyal regulars, and for good reason. None of the tourist riffraff happens here. Hope it stays this way!"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/1/16,"Delicious home-style Turkish food. A welcome change from the typical d?ner joint or grill house.Very reasonably priced as well. The ""menu"" - usually a stew + rice + salad - costs less than 8 Euros and the typical Turkish free tea treat. So, ""real"", solid food for a great price. What more would you want?"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/2/16,"I'm so glad I found this gem!! We weren't sure what Turkish exactly entailed, but we were in the area, and this seemed authentic. For a price of 7 euros, we got a variety of food - I felt I got all my nutrients for the day in one sitting! As travelers, we truly enjoyed the experience because we felt we got much more than we paid for. When we entered, the chef showed and explained to us all the menu options. I got the curry, which was delicious. I enjoyed the side vegetables and rice as well. Overall, a great experience for the group. We were even able to pay separately! What a friendly place."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,6/29/16,"I am not quite sure what the difference between homey Turkish food and what is not. I am going to assume homey entails more focus on the food and ingredients rather than the presentation and other things. One glance at this place and it certainly looks homey if not rather like a one pot, buffet, fast food kind of style. There was counter full of prepared food in the back and you can pick and choose your meal from thy selection. No there's nothing created here a la minute but the price kind of reflects that.While I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, I can say without a doubt it is tasty...for the most part. Everything does indeed taste ""homey"" as every dish is sort of a mis-mash of different vegetables and meats in a consistent sauce. By that I mean most of the dishes have similar sauces a tastes quite similar despite it having different ingredients. The rice is a nicely prepared with fantastic texture and just the right amount of squeakiness to them all the while still soft and pillowy. The chicken is sightly dry but very nicely compensated with the great sauce that it's bathed in.Sadly this meal wasn't quite as memorable as I had hope for. Unlike the Turkish cuisines I have had in the past there wasn't one or more dishes I would recommend of you must order.Everything tastes good -- like a every day good kind of meal mom used to prepare."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/1/16,"As a Turkish person this restaurant was the best Turkish food I had out of Turkey.I wish we had something close to this food in Canada"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/27/16,"If you want to get a taste of tasty, genuine, home cooked-style Turkish food, you cannot beat Mercan. I felt like I had been transported to my Turkish mother's kitchen, and they get all the details right. It's so affordable as well, I think I spent $20 for two people, and we had a glass of raki as well. If you're looking for a fancy, sit-down and order sort of place, this isn't it. But that's not a Turkish experience. This is really like going to a friend's house for dinner, and it tastes like that's how it was prepared. Don't skip it if you're in Berlin and like mediterranean food. It's also very quiet and offers a nice patio for dinner."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/30/16,"This is seriously the best place we ate at in Berlin. Quality ,price and variety all came together to make for 2 great dining experiences. For North Americans it's a little intimidating to stand and point out what you want , but in the end the obvious care and grace that went into the cooking is obvious. The drink prices are also reasonable , eat here!"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/29/16,"Came here with a couple friends on a Wednesday.  Hadn't had this type of Turkish food before, but was quite impressed with both taste and service.  We ordered several different meals (meat or veg dish plus rice with a couple of beans).  Favorites were the moussaka and spicy meatballs.  Also liked the stuffed zucchini.  Place was relatively crowded, but service was still reasonable.  Definitely a good place for ""real"" Turkish food!"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/3/13,"Paid Mercan a visit last week after reading about the at Qype. They serve great simple Turkish food. Main dish with rice or bulge and a tomato salad or cake  6EUR. You are supposed to order the food at their counter, and bring it to your table yourself. But 1-2-3 the staff have brought your food.You can choose between 5 main dishes  2 with lamb, 2 with beef and 1 vegen.Go here if you want a quick but good meal, and you do want a bit more than a d?ner. Do not expect to sit here for hours.Finish with some tea."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/27/13,"Excellent home style Turkish food - very reasonably priced and super friendly staff!  You can get their ""menu"" for 6 euros (entree, bulgar/rice & salad) or ""mix"" for 8 euros (extra entree).  We enjoyed our meal with a glass of wine, for 3 euros each."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,6/9/15,"Homemade Turkish food. The tableclothes may put you off at first, but they just go to show how authentic the place is. For a menu under 10 EUR, you get real Turkish stews, flavourful dishes that envy nothing from the Bergmannstr. pretentious sort."
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/22/11,"It was such a pleasant surprise to find this restaurant. I was headed for the same old haloumi at ""random"" place when my friend said - no I've got somewhere better to go. The food was plentiful, flavorful, and authentic. The tomato salad (e-Coli free!) was the most delicious I've had since the beaches of Morocco. To top it all off the guys working there were incredibly nice. Will definitely be going back!"
Mercan,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/5/13,Fantastic food and best service in a long time in Berlin
fabecks,German,4,?11-20,5,5/3/16,Local smart-setters complain that Fabecks is full of old people and the menu is dated.  To them I say phooey.  Fabecks has a sublime beer and wine selection and a comforting menu.  A classic.
fabecks,German,4,?11-20,5,2/7/16,Fantastic food and service!! It's really nice to sit outside in the spring and summer!  The best summer drink is called Hollunder! It's really refreshing and a nice drink to sit outside and enjoy the conversation.
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,10/30/17,"This beer garden is huge and worth a visit, if not to drink than for another German experience. The beer and food selection are not huge but the variety makes up for it. I enjoyed everything we ordered. This is good because trying to make decisions on what to drink and eat is a buzzkill.Good place for a getogether regardless of group size. It was also full of students, the after work crowd, and us tourists. Good times and I could see myself staying there for hours!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,8/9/17,"I found this place via travel blog recommendations of this being the oldest Beer Garden in Berlin. Huge seating areas under the trees with tons of picnic tables as well as a connected restaurant.Really fun place to experience a beer garden with a good atmosphere and good beer. Got pretty crowded as the night went on, but with the open space it never got forbiddingly loud with was great."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,6/13/17,"Classic good old Biergarten in Prenzlauer Berg. The pils is good, the staff is incredibly nice and helpful and the food is fine as well. Be there early in summer when it's hot as it gets very crowded. But I reckon that's part of its charm as well. Perfect spot for an after work beer and/or people watching. ;)Note for dog owners:It was bit much for my dog too handle even though the staff always brings around water and is giving him wink all the time. However that many people, kids, noise, and the tight space between the tabels etc. might turn out to be burdensome for some of our four-legged friends."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,2/13/17,"This came on recommendation from an American yelper spending their time in Berlin and boy was I not disappointed! I came during this past month in the freezing and bitter cold winter season, so obviously there wasn't any outdoor seating but the indoor space was huge, romantically lit, and warm. Our server was very sweet and kind, open to giving us recommendations on the menu and other German specialties. We ended up sharing the Cheese Sp?tzle (egg noodles) with leaf spinach, fried onions and a side salad, a braised beef in vinegar with potatoes and cabbage, and a Apple strudel with raisins, nuts and hot vanilla sauce! The Cheese Sp?tzle was so delicious, the egg noodle was done so well, not soggy at all - I would eat that again everyday. The braised beef was so so tender. I personally enjoyed the vinegar hint to the beef, I thought the dish was extremely well done. The dessert was alright in my opinion, a nice end to the meal but not the best apple strudel I've ever had before. Overall prices are great for the quality, the food is made to order so it tasted fresh and absolutely divine. I am always irritated that I have to pay for water in Europe, but this place made up for it with the food!! If I ever return to Berlin, I will most definitely come back to Prater Garden for a meal or some schnitzel."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,7/4/17,"The Parter Garten is a beautiful spot to come for the plentiful outdoor seating with plenty of natural shade. We did not try any food here, but had beer. The weissbier and the pillsner beer were both great. The way the place works is you go to a window to order your drinks and carry them back to the table yourself. There is a person who goes around collecting empty glasses. Sadly, they have not gotten with the 21st century yet and only accept Euro cash here and not any credit cards."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,6/16/17,"One of the top 2 or 3 outdoor drinking spots. They are open until 1am or so on the weekends. Great beer selection, nice staff, good prices. Really cool spot to check out."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,3/27/16,"German food: check.  beer: check.  Atmosphere: check Outside seating: check. Say no more, this place is outstanding on a summer' s day and I could sit there for hours with my hefe weissen in the sun. If there's no sun, go inside and have a traditional German meal! Prenzlauer Berg is obligatory while in Berlin, and Prater too."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,6/20/17,"This was a traditional and delightful beer garden to spend a lazy afternoon.  I heard from people I met that the food was delicious, but a little on the pricey side for a beer garden.  I would say due to how long this place has been around, it's a must stop if you're out that way in Berlin!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,7/23/16,"Prater Garten is a beer garden! They also serve sausages!Hey I'm from New York I don't know the area but if your looking on google maps like I was it might look like the outskirts of town but it's not it was eleven pm and the neighborhood just kept getting livelier and livelier!This was a damn cool beer garden they serve beer and sausages!!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,9/5/17,First place I went to when I landed in Berlin. So peaceful. Loved the small community vibe!
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,8/11/17,"Good food and a nice, classic beer garden. On the expensive side (especially the ""restaurant side"") considering the food, but still very good. If you don't mind spending a little extra money this place is great."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,7/28/17,Super cool Biergarten!  Good food and great Beer in the oldest Biergarten in Berlin!  Worth the trip just to sit and soak it in.
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,6/16/15,"Great place to go with friends! I spent a few days in Berlin during a Europe trip, and we were told to check this place out for an authentic beer garden - I could not have been happier with the experience. Typical food - bratwurst, potato salad, meatloaf, etc. and a wide range of beer options. We all definitely enjoyed trying some German specialities! We went on a Saturday and the place wasn't terribly busy, probably because it's very open and has a lot of space. Definitely would recommend, especially for any tourists wanting a great beer garden experience!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,4/30/16,"Prater was an enormous cash-only establishment, with hundreds of people sitting both inside and outside on the crisp Friday evening we came to dine. The food, beer, and coffee were all wonderful. The service was rather slow, but understandably so given the volume of patrons. To drink, I ordered a Prater lager schwarz, which is a dark rich lager without a sweet or nutty undertones. The menu featured an entire asparagus starter section which I did not have room in my stomach to try. Food:Potato soup w spicy sausage - very tasty. The sausage blended well with the rich potato baseWiener schnitzel (veal escalope) - also good. The cucumber salad that accompanied it was creamy but light and refreshing. Kassler ham - the highlight of the night. Not only was the meat flavorful and perfectly cooked, but it came with a mix of mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, and a malt beer sauce that had me licking the plate clean by the end. It was the best meal I had in Berlin and I would highly recommend all to go, from locals to tourists."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,5,9/23/16,"We were in Berlin for 2.5 days and we went here 4 times. The beer and the food was great, and sitting outside under the chestnut trees was perfect for a summer evening in Germany."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,11/25/14,"My very FIRST biergarten experience!I enchanced my beer chugging skills at Prater Garten. In atypical, glorious Berlin sunshine, I was holding my half a liter Prater Pils grinning ear to ear like some tourist who just stumbled on the best find ever!Super casual, buzzing with a friendly crowd and lots of Euro languages being thrown about (of course, we had to sit right NEXT to the Italians!), everyone here just had a good time. The yellow communal seating were very inviting underneath the shade of the Chestnut trees, the bathrooms were clean and ordering at the window is fast and easy. Bring your family, your friends, invite your Tinder date (yup! he showed up and she was googly-gaga over him!) or was it just the beer buzz? either way, FUN times in Berlin!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,9/13/16,"Came here on vacation to come visit the oldest beer hall in Berlin.Great choice of beers and my friend and I tried the Lambwurst. A sausage made with lamb on a little bun with mustard.  It was pretty good, but I have had better sausages.  Same goes for the pretzel.  I liked it, but it didn't go above and beyond for me. The best thing is the beer so stick with that!"
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,11/22/15,"This was a very fun place. It was wet out so we sat inside. There was plenty of room but I could see as big as the bier garten was, that it probably gets pretty crazy here. We will have to return again.The food was great. We had the meatloaf, the goulash, the wiener schnitzel and the potato soup as well as a lot of beer.I found a great German red wine, 2012 Sp?tburgunder trocken, QbA, Axel Neiss, Pfalz (a German Pinot) that was lovely. I wish I could find it elsewhere."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,5/7/17,"Felt sort of hipster meets old school, not in a bad way. Had the lamb sausage which was great. Beer was good. Ambiance is a bit weird. Might have been because we came at off hours and it was fairly empty. There looks like there is a stage--and I would come back for some sort of show, but probably not just for a beer."
Prater Garten,German,4,?11-20,4,10/27/15,"A must visit in Berlin! I think it's one of the oldest beer gardens around and largest. It's great for a nice sunny day but there is also a restaurant inside if it's cold or late at night. Order the Beef and potatoes and Pilsner!"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/6/15,"Great and huge pizzas and other italian food.Very cheap and kind service.Nice place to sit in. :)"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,8/20/16,"I was really hungry and not in the mood for Pasta or Pizza, so I actually ordered a Pollo a la Gorgonzola.The dish was well prepared and tasted good and the potatoes side was perfect.The restaurant also avoids the pitfall of many other Italian restaurants and actually has a concise, compact menu, and when the menu is small then this usually things are made well.The real special thing about the place is the prices. All dishes are very fairly priced and you can have a full dinner with a drink and desert for less than 15 EUR. Service is also very friendly."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/31/16,"We were here on new years eve - I was surprised, you hardly expect this on an evening like that - the food was excellent, we tested various dishes like tagliatelle tartufo, antipasti misti, swordfish carpaccio, Pizza Parma etc. - it was really good, will definitely be visiting this place again :-)Felice anno nuovo!"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/27/16,"Great cozy Italian place. Service was wonderful and the food was terrific. We were there for dinner and ordered off of their pasta menu. The penne pollo was delicious. Tip - If you fancy pizza, let them know - they'll make it and bring it from their pizza place next door."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/27/16,"This is one of my favorite pizza places in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, just like it has to be, crispy thin Italian style and fresh toppings - very tasty and staff is really friendly here as well"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/23/16,"Great food, fast and very tasty. Simple, but the best. Under 15 euro's per person. Great value for money. Great atmosphere. Would recommend it!"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,9/20/15,"I loved the atmosphere and our waitress. It was so refreshing and welcoming, perfect for a small group of friends and even a date.The food was good and plenty for the price. 5 of us are generously for only 100 euros. I don't like the giant Parmesan grate they use, it dries out the food. Get the antipasti platter - it's huge and really good. The main courses were all pretty good (not amazing). If they have the truffle ravioli, get it. It was the best dish they served us that night."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/10/15,"Good food, nice ambiance and friendly service. I've tried the pizza and the pasta. It's not the best Italian food I've ever had, but it's very good."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/23/12,"Good food, reasonable prices. Nice staff. I'll definitely visit them again. Nice starters, very good gnocchi, house wine was an easily drinkable red, desert didn't blow me away."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/19/12,always end up returning here for any special occasion. prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and the staff are lovely. couldn't fault it
Mant?e,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,10/12/15,"OMG This place has been the best restaurant I have dined at while I have been on a 2 week vacation in Europe. I was with three other people and they ordered the steaks and I got a shrimp with vegetables.The meals came with a bread basket with some kind of Mediterranean spice on it that made it so awesome. I got a tomato soup ( because I was out all day exploring Berlin in the horrible rain) which had the most delicious flavor profile that I ever tasted! The meals also came with a very big salad which was a pleasant and tasty addition.The bill was very reasonable; we had 2 cocktails, a few beers, some sodas, soup, 3 rump steaks and the shrimp with vegetables and the bill was only 88 Euros. How inexpensive is that??"
Mant?e,Turkish,4,?11-20,2,7/28/16,"My boss and I were at this restaurant earlier today for lunch and we had the worst experience possible. There was only one poor waitress doing all the work- cleaning the tables, taking the orders, bringing the dishes.. While nobody else was helping out.We finally got to order after sitting for 45 minutes in the restaurant. After 20 more minutes, we decided to take it to go. We still paid for our food, and took it with us.When we got back to the office, we noticed they missed missed one of our orders.After sitting in their restaurant for more than an hour, paying for it, and then not receiving what we ordered, we were very disappointed with their service and wouldn't recommend anybody to go there during busy times unless they have more than one waitress working there."
Mant?e,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,11/19/15,"This is by far my favorite lunch place in Berlin. The chicken with hummus is really tasty, the flat bread with tomatoes that comes on the side is delicious and the waiters are always friendly. It does get full around lunchtime, so either come a bit later or reserve a table."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,8/2/17,"This is as good as it gets. We had a five course lunch at T.R and Everything from the service to the ambiance and food was nothing short of spectacular. I only had to take one bite of my pork dumbling with pepper and mayonaise to understand the level of food T.R serves up. Before our visit, me and my wife talked about how much you can elevate asian food. Now we know how great you can do when you elevate it and turns it into magic fine dining fusion. We had the Wasabi langoustine wich was a ""must have"" signature dish and well Worth the extra 12 ? on top of the normal lunch price tag. The T.R version of the Peking Duck was another must and had three different plates wich all came together with the classic flavors of the original dish but much refined and with a duck broth that blew me away.  Beef with pepper and XO sauce, Chicken with peanut sauce and Hamachi with jade sauce was among other of our favourites but all dishes was so tasty that its hard to choose.  The prices are as you can imagine and our tab ended up at around 250 ? with one bottle of riesling, water and a chinese beer. The service is just perfect without beeing too much as some Michelin restuarants. We had another great meal at 3 star iconic l'Astrance in Paris but honestly, this one was even better. So if you find yourself in Berlin and want to devour a meal that will leave you breathless and craving more. This is the place without a doubt."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,4,12/1/17,"this was our splurge meal while in Berlin for a week and while there were some hits and misses on the food, i really had a good experience here at Tim Raue. first making a reservation was really easy on their website and there is an English page for those that don't speak German. i was able to get my preferred date/time by looking a few weeks ahead of time. the restaurant itself is located near CheckPoint Charlie and the restaurant is just so unassuming that we almost walked right by it haha. you enter through an alleyway that leads to a courtyard entrance. service was great right upon entry - our coats were taken and then we were escorted to our table. for my meal, i went with the 6-course signature menu so that i could try most of the chef's most well known dishes. out of the 6 dishes - i'd say that i liked the banana stuffed brussel sprouts and the black pepper beef the least. huge fan of the salmon, suckling pig and langoustine as well as the cheese cake dessert though. i will have to say that Tim Raue does not shy away from flavor and really just going for it - so even in the dishes that i didnt necessarily like, i can still appreciate the different flavor/texture profiles that he tries in his dishes. you cannot fault him for not seasoning his food enough haha. the 6-course signature menu is around 150 euros so it's definitely not cheap but really worth a splurge for a fancy dinner out in Berlin!"
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,3,9/5/16,"Tim Raue is a high-end, two Michelin star restaurant located near Checkpoint Charlie in the heart of Berlin, serving Asian fusion food. The service, plating, and presentation at this semi-casual restaurant were impeccable, but the flavors of the dishes themselves left something to be desired, especially given the high price point. We got the six-course Signature menu as well as the restaurant's signature dish, the Peking duck. Out of all these courses, I found two of them in particular to be worth mentioning. First, the Kaisergranat, or lobster, which was breaded, fried, and served with a delicious wasabi mayonnaise with just the right amount of kick, along with mango, carrots, and what appeared to be rice crackers: the lobster was tender and flavorful and went perfectly with all of the accompaniments--even the waiter serving us said that this was his absolute favorite dish from the restaurant! The other very memorable menu item was the black pepper beef, which was fall-apart tender (uncharacteristic of a typical Asian beef dish) and very deep in savory beef flavor. It was also served with peppercorns and covered in a vinegar/tea sauce, which added to the complexity of the flavors.Overall, eating here was certainly a great experience and a splurge, but I probably would not come back anytime soon, since the flavors of the dishes were not all that memorable, and given the high price point."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,8/22/17,"Traditional Chinese food with some modern twists. Presentation is decent. Service was good. A lot of variations in terms of the flavor and the 4 course meal was well worth the price. Not sure about if the 6 course justifies the premium though. Only major complaint is the duck which was cooked too western like and below my bar, although the bar for Chinese in terms of roasted duck is really high. Just don't call it Peking duck anymore... Perch and scallop were of very good quality and tasted fine but somehow lost some flavor unique to fresh seafood - probably due to excessive pre-processing. Should be fine for people not used to fresh/live seafood though."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,4,8/11/16,"4 stars for food but 5 for service and attentiveness. I wasn't sure what to expect at Tim Raue, mostly because the idea of fusing German and Asian flavors(East Asian but not necessarily SE Asian as I found out) was not that appealing. I had the 4 course tasting menu which was accompanied by an amuse buche and an digestif palette cleanser. The best course by far was the beef sort rib with spring onions, although the duck dim sum was perfectly cooked as well. Overall everything had the same flavor and lacked depth. My favorite favorite item was the post meal cucumber freeze with passion fruit creme. I could eat that shit every day and die happy. Maybe for dinner service there is more attention to the food, but overall it just wasn't that exciting- high quality products with a focus on seasonality was much appreciated but honestly I didn't find anything bold or bright enough (exception mentioned above).I would go again because for two michelins the price is on point, and of course the sommelier was perfect."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,2/27/16,"Amazing but pricey Asian fusion restaurant around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie. Great ambiance and world class service that seems effortless potions are small but packed with flavors I've never experienced before. Most are sweet and savory. The extensive wine list is reasonably priced. I've posted lots of pictures of the restaurant and the meal. Without desert and including a tip the tab came to about ?285. That included two glasses of sparkling wine and a bottle of Neumeister Sauvignon Blanc. You get a great amuse bouche medley and sweets with the meal. From a dining point of view, this is as good as it gets in Berlin. Quality triumphs over quantity. Very satisfying."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,2,3/12/17,Meh. It tastes like nothing. Not sharp enough. It tastes like diet food.
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,3,7/25/16,"Excellent food - not really excellent staff considering the price range.One could see the staff coming out of the kitchen furiously, even being nasty to fellow colleagues, and suddenly putting on a really fake smile when arriving at the table.The staff's behaviour made me feel uncomfortable, especially when I compare it to the Michelin restaurant ""Reinstoff"" around the corner, where the staff were authentic, humorous and friendly."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,11/8/15,"I mean, there is a reason this place has two Michelin Stars. It's awesome. Some of the single most amazing tastes I've had. I probably would skip the Peking duck if I went again, however it's worth forking up for the wasabi lobster tail. So, so good. Also, get the Peking duck dumplings. Beef was a great main as well.Great atmosphere, felt so relaxed after the nice long meal. If you have some extra money to eat with, or you are rich, eat here."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,2,6/10/16,"Given the buzz - in Berlin and elsewhere - I was very excited to dine at Tim Raue. The disappointment began almost immediately (one might say that expectation is all or almost all, so I should have tempered my excitement upon entering the restaurant?). My seat faced a large canvas of trash bags (my request to shift didn't go anywhere though there were empty tables at the end of the evening). Perhaps I am not hip enough and too old, but the buzz of young waiters attired in black, wearing Keds, gave at best a sense that one was in a highly self-regarding contemporary art gallery in a global city. The cubicle-like banquette was not all that comfortable. Never mind: I came to eat, not to luxuriate in a plush environment or to see a well-dressed (again, apologies for my conventional taste) women and men as servers. I ordered an eight-course tasting menu (my companion went with the 'signature' tasting menu with the presumably 'signature' wine tasting). Amuse-bouches were Tim Raue's variations on little dishes one gets at Chinese restaurants. They were pleasant - and piquant - enough, though each of the six or so tiny dishes were flavored too bluntly for my taste (most annoyingly, over-salted). The wine pairing commenced with the first dish ('imperial caviar'). The sommelier brought out Dom Macle (a Jura wine). Pardon my conventional thinking but I'd have expected a glass of champagne (preferably crisp and unoxidized - I realize that the restaurant cannot afford to serve Krug so perhaps Taittinger?) or perhaps even vodka. Surprised by his choice, I asked what he was thinking about the particular wine pairing. He stammered a few inaudible words and left. I like Macle (and many Jura) wines but - while good on its own - its alchemy with the caviar dish was puzzling at best. Shrugging my shoulders, I was happy to give the benefit of my doubt. The second course, 'white asparagus' was unfortunately poorly prepared. Limp and fibrous (it's toward the end of the Spargelzeit or the asparagus season even in northern Germany), the imperfect dish was accompanied by a Sancerre. To be sure, it was from an excellent producer, Pascal Cotat, and asparagus can go well with sauvignon blanc. The problem was more that when I asked why he picked this wine, the sommelier couldn't really say much of anything. Not a word about why Pascal and not his brother Fran?ois. Not why Sancerre rather than other regions' sauvignon blanc. Or why not Gr?ner Veltliner or Alsatian Riesling or whatever.Rather than piling more examples, I will just summarize. Tim Raue is probably a great chef (one of his signature dishes that my companion ate  - a langoustine dish - was superb). However, coming from the land of Asian-inspired French cooking - the San Francisco Bay Area - Tim Raue's 'fusion' can be great when he checks 'Asian' flavors (such as soy sauce or wasabi), as in the langoustine dish, but well-nigh unpleasant when he uses them bluntly. It struck me as a poor imitation of imperial Chinese cuisine but with multiple portions of whatever flavors are used. It is no match, for example, with Benu or any number of restaurants in my home town.The sommelier's choices for the 'signature' tasting menu seemed generally excellent so I am not sure if he didn't spend any time thinking through for my tasting course. More troubling to me, however, is his unwillingness to articulate his reasons for choosing a particular wine to go with a particular dish. It's possible that his English is poor, but when he switched to German he wasn't much better. When asked about the Bordeaux white he selected for Hamachi, all he could say was that the candied-fruit flavor went well with the 'jade sauce' for the fish (the fish, incidentally, was overcooked - surely a bad sign in a high-end restaurant). There was not a single pairing that was inspired and not a single time he (or other servers) gave any information that went beyond the label and Hugh Johnson's compact guide.The new 'international style,' i thought, valorized local and regional produce (and wine). I didn't really see much of anything that would satisfy a locavore in food or wine (not a single German or even Austrian Riesling). The final dish probably said it all: Thompson grapes in a meringue made of calpico (Japanese sugary drink reminiscent of lassi). Edible.Finally, before the final dish the waiter came and took away my specially-printed menu and said that the penultimate dish wouldn't be coming. I can see that anyone can make a mistake but did he have to tell me right before the dish was about to show up? I can only hope that the restaurant had an off night but I suspect that it is coasting on its past achievements. If there are defenders, then I'd suggest that they take a trip to San Francisco (Benu) to learn what a truly fabulous Asian-inspired fusion cuisine might taste like. In short, Tim Raue is a disappointment. June 2016."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,11/26/14,"I've now been here twice, both times for lunch. It's so crazy cheap compared to michelin restaurants in Denmark, so it would be completely crazy if I didn't go, when in Berlin!The lunch menu is usually a bunch of different courses, and you then choose how many courses you want. A 6-course lunch-menu is 68 euros - but you can also chose 3, 4 or 5 courses. There might be an extra fee on some of the courses, but nothing too expensive. You'll also get a set of different hors d'oeuvres before te 1st course. The atmosphere (and waiters) is extremely polite, but at the same time really laidback and relaxed and does not feel snobby at all. The sommelier is always up for a little chit/chat about the different wines, and are happy to learn you something interesting about the wine you're drinking along the way.The kitchen is asian fusion and so, so, so good! Mr. Raue and his team of chefs certainly knows what they're doing out there."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,1,10/15/16,"The atmosphere is pleasant.   The wait staff are attentive and informal.   Some of the visual presentations of the food are over the top gorgeous.   The food is fair at best.   The portions are scandalously, insultingly small, for instance a single scallop sliced with a drop of sauce for 46 Euros (I kid you not)."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,1,6/17/16,"Very disappointing experience. Seems to be more about setting the right innovative vibe, rather than substance, connoisseurship, unfortunately. We paid more than 600 Euro and but the service and the aesthetics were not good. Above all, the sommelier seemed not quite informed and his English was poor. The aesthetics are deliberately ""cool"" but ultimately irritating, including fake Chinese contemporary art hanging in toilets and a painting with the atom bomb and the writing ""The End"" at the wall just before one leaves the restaurant. I do not understand how this restaurant has received the ratings it does - too much fashion/hype, not enough substance/depth. This place is not likely to stay if it continues with such a superficial approach. Not comparable to restaurants in the same rank according to our disappointing evening."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,10/19/15,"this place rocked from the service to food and everything else.  my favorite was pike perch with its own theatrical smoke machine (liquid nitrogen probably) and foie gras that came as a part of ""peking duck."" (12 more euros) Complimentary pickles were so delicious I wanted some white rice to go with them but alas they don't serve rice.  Not cheap but still a bargain for such experience."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,2,4/15/16,"High class and fancy restaurant. If you like it than you should go here as it is great. For persons like me, who want to be full after lunch/dinner this is the wrong place. Prices high, portion small. Other way round would be better."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,7/9/16,"Amazing food, good service, must go when you are in berlin! Asian food with european twist."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,5,5/30/14,"We dined here last June.  The first of 4 multi Michelin star restaurants we dined at in 4 days.  Tim Raue was much better than expected.  One of the best 2 star restaurants we experienced.  We had recommended this place to several people and were pleased to see that Tim Raue was ranked #78 in the world recently.  Congratulations.Our dining experience was superb.  There were 3 of us and we all ordered different Prix fixe menus.  Our son is a vegetarian and they had a fabulous vegetarian course for him.  We tried some of it and the creativity, presentation and flavors were amazing.When we are back in Berlin, we will definitely be back here."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,4,1/8/16,"Tim Raue has a few restaurants in Berlin and this one is his signature restaurant that has 2 Michelin Stars. The decor is very relaxed as well is the overall restaurant experience. It seems a bit understated given the high profile, but the waiters are very good. The food is Asian fusion cuisine with some twists. We opted for the 6 course menu with some of his signature dishes. The peking duck is actually a decomposed dish with some bold and strong flavours. Another great dish was the suckling pig, the crust was amazing and perfectly rendered. The dim sum were good, but I would have expected more from a 2 star restaurant where you pay around 15 EUR for 2 dumplings. The pigeon was cooked really well but did lack a bit of innovation. Overall there was a very consistent flavour coming from the sauce that was present in 2 or 3 dishes. The wines that were paired with our dishes were good, but nothing great. I would have wished for bolder and maybe riskier wine choices. We certainly enjoyed the meal, but I have to say that I wouldn't go back. The food was good, but compared to other 2 star restaurants it lacked innovation. It certainly was the best Asian type of cuisine I had in Berlin, but it lacked innovation and bold flavours compared to other 2 star restaurants like Reinstoff or Fischers Fritz. Also the portions are very small and I wouldn't go for anything below 5 or 6 courses, so the 3 course option is really not an option..."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,4,11/21/10,"Tim is infatuated with Asian herbs, particularly lemongrass and cumin, and the place reminds me of the early heady days when Australians were leading the charge into fusion cuisine. That said, the quality of dining is quite good, though the portions could have been a touch more generous. The ingredients are indeed top quality and the textures and flavours are rather sublime at times. Service is perfect, attentive, friendly with a touch of humour. Decor is as one would expect from a restaurant that charges 148 EUR for the tasting menu. Overall, good, maybe even very good but still some way short of the finesse of, say, Harald Wohlfahrt at the Schwarzwalder Stube. However, Tim Raue's genius is his ability to sway Germans into appreciating fusion dining and that can only be a good thing."
Tim Raue,Modern European,4,Above ?41,4,2/18/11,"I like the feel of this restaurant, it's elegant and comfortable at the same time. The staff are friendly, attentive and enthusiastic. The food is modern chinese, beautifully plated. I was a bit let down by the desserts which were good but not spectacular. It is surprisingly expensive (even by London standards I would say) but I would probably go back for a special occasion."

I moved close to this place, so one night I was hungry and I really needed sth to eat. I chose this shoppe because it was the closest one. Hallelujah! It's the best K?fte in the world!!!! Absolutely amazing!!! For me there are only two culinary highlights in this world: Kaiseki in Kyoto or Koefte at Koefte Evi!!! It's so good. Really. Go there! People might look angrily at you and it just looks like a neighborhood Imbiss, but it's so much more! It's the goddamn temple of K?fte! The holy grail of Turkish minced meat! The Mekka of Turkish food! The best thing: Kaiseki sets you back 300 Euros, the K?fte is just 3! Euros!!! I'm loving it!!!PS: I always thought this shop is called K?fteci. Not K?fte Evi. I'm not sure..."
Maselli,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/5/15,"Fantastic little Italian restaurant. The ambiance is cozy and the staff are friendly and very attentive though careful not interrupt conversation. Started with a melted cheese with oregano and olive oil. It was wonderful. The beet ravioloni with goat cheese was amazing  - very pungent cheese filling - with a very nice, subtle butter sauce. The grilled octopus was perfectly done - very tender and flavorful - with potatoes and leeks as accompaniments. All regional dishes Pulgia. The buffalo milk ricotta as a dessert was good but not to die for. I didn't care for the coffee sauce around it. Good espresso machiato - ristretto, as it should be.We'll definitely be back."
Maselli,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/3/13,"Understatement on the highest levelI found the Maselli by mistake, but it was my luck because it's my favorite restaurant in Berlin. Delicious and fresh food, especially the assaginis, for fair prices and a very hearty environment. I LOVE IT!"
Maselli,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/17/14,"We came to Berlin in the middle of the soccer World Cup, and kreutzberg was almost empty. But read about this place on yelp and decided to try it out. They do a permanent starters (antipasti) menu, and then they have different main courses on their blackboard each day. We had three lovely starters and gnocchi with lamb ragu. Really delicious food and great service from the sweetest Italian lady. The only drawback is that the menu is in only Italian and German - makes it a bit hard for those of us who speak neither."
Maselli,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/27/13,"This is my favorite restaurant in Berlin - whether it is date night, a night out with friends, visiting relatives, or colleagues (who are, in my case, also friends), this restaurant never disappoints. I am always amazed at the quality of food that we get here for prices that are anything but exorbitant. The stracciatella (like mozarella, but creamier) is a must! The menu rotates regularly but there are always a few staples. I recommend starting with a spritz and settling in with a bottle of wine - but make sure to save room for dessert (maybe even an espresso and some grappa or limoncello)! Extremely friendly staff/owner, it is the only place in Berlin I feel like I am treated like family. Not huge, so book ahead if it is a weekend. I also have brought a few homesick Italians here for some real Italian cooking, and they all agree... 'it's just like home!'"
Trattoria La Bruschetta,Italian,4,?11-20,3,7/14/15,"I have heard this place from different colleagues. And fianlly found a time to try this out. The location of this restaurant is alright. Right direct to the mein street, very easy to find. The restaurant itself isn't really big, but it does have a cosy feeling. I came here with colleague for lunch. Let's say there are serval things are low points to me. First of all, let's talk the food. I ordered a pasta. Very basic one. But honestly it didn't really taste that good. I am quite a fan of pasta,  I prefer the one from Vapiano. I did expected a bit more since I came to the Italian restaurant. Second of all, the potion of it, it really wasn't enough. Expecially with how much it cost. That's the other thing I didn't really like, the price is higher than I expected. For lunch, perhaps it is a bit too fancy. Sadlly, I didn't see they have any lunch special offers or sort of promotion. I saw some other colleagues ordered different thing. For example, the pizza did look great, maybe that could be a better choice. But again it still cost quite a lot for a lunch. For dinner, it would be ok."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/21/17,"This is a hidden gem!!! The price is so affordable you would not believe it. Food is great and will definitely be back when I'm in Berlin! Plus they serve beer bintang!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/16/17,"This place gets pretty busy, but it's not the sort of place where you get a reservation as it's really a local watering hole. Delicious food.  There is outdoor seating which is great if you can handle the colder weather in the winter months.  Worth a try for sure."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/23/17,"5-6 euros for indonesian food??? Man, I love this place! I tried the nasi goreng bebek, batagor, pecel lele and gado2. They were all good! Definitely recommended!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/25/17,"Noodles with beef and duck curry, as recommended may times before, was fabulous and paired well with affordable Berliner beer (2.50e per half-liter). Also started with wontons in chicken soup that hit the spot on this chilly night.Service from the young gentleman was great. We arrived at 845 and claimed the last two seats, and an hour later (past closing time) most of the customers are still hanging out and ordering drinks.This was a refreshing change for two Asian-descent tourists who have had too much heavy German food and were seeking a taste of home"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/12/17,"One of my favourite places in Berlin. It's nothing fancy, with a kind of plastic table top feel, but the food is cheap and excellent. So far I've tried the beef rendang (more than once), Gado Gado and Nasi Goreng. It's always rammed - so for groups you'll need to reserve a spot. The only critique is that I'm never able to find concrete opening times anywhere - and I've had to return home disappointed and or hungry. I know that the place was closed for the month of January - thankfully it's been open since then."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/15/17,"A great example of fine food and poor management. The food was fresh, veggies crisp, duck curry spicy. A 5 on food. However, the menu was a joke. Of 30 items listed only 5 were available. Meals were served to us 20 minutes apart, so 1 of us finished eating before the other had been served. There was a wait for tables and no one could manage a list of names for who would receive the next open table."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/9/16,"Indonesian dishes are pretty well presented. As a native Indonesian, dishes with chilli sauce (sambal terasi, cabe ijo, sambal pecel, etc) are incredible! You can also request the level of spicyness to be increased (scharf) if you really can handle it.One negative side is there are only a few tables there. The place is not spacious (big). I suggest you to book a table if you want to go there. Usually there are many people coming during peak hours for lunch (12.00 -13.30) or dinner (19.00 - 20.00)."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/5/17,"Excellent food, great service and unbelievable prices! Highly recommend going here when in Berlin!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,3,4/14/16,"Maybe these yelp reviews set expectations too high or I simple wasn't super lucky with my order (Tofu and Green Bean Curry and Chicken Satay). The food was good but not outstanding and the portion was rather small. Maybe that was because it was take out?The menue is not very extraordinairy and even though I've never been to an Indonesian restaurant before (not speaking of Indonesia haha) I didn't find much new or interesting items on the menu that I wouldn't have seen somewhere else before.  What surprised me was that she asked me if I minded a little wait because they needed to cook rice. I was there around 6.45pm, so perfect dinner time and the restaurant was fairly busy but not super crowded. Anyhow, I can recommend to go at least once to try, since the food is good in taste but I wouldn't make this my new weekly hangout.PS: The prices are fairly cheap!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/29/15,"Hidden gem alert:  5 stars for perfect execution of cheap, authentic, Indonesian food.  The food was outstanding & freshly prepared by the order. I'm glad I went to Tuk-tuk prior & not afterwards- I would have been disappointed by the food quality comparison.  Tuktuk is good & a bit more upgraded atmosphere... But now this is my new favorite Indonesian.The restaurant is really no-frills, bells or whistles at all...do not get dolled up to come here... Just bring your appetite, cash (no debit/credit cards accepted), and a positive attitude.  Reservations are a good idea because the seating is extremely limited..My Date & i Lucked out & got seats....I think we were the only non-Indonesian patrons there. .  Yum!!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/8/17,"We loved this place! What a nice surprise so close to our hotel. It was a very small ""hole in the wall"" kind of place. They were so friendly and squeezed us in at a shared table for 4. The portions are huge and very inexpensive. I had the crispy duck with peanut sauce and my husband had the curry. The glass noodles are also delicious... But the dishes was way too much. We enjoyed talking to a young hipster couple from Switzerland at our table and the older Dutch couple at the table next to us. They ordered five dishes and did a great job... But wow, that's a lot of food. Loved this place, would come back again during this trip. That good."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/25/16,"I was here earlier with a companion, and we needed lunch. I already had this restaurant in my radar but never really had the chance to check it out, until today, since my companion for the day lives a minutes walk from here.Seating is very limited, and we thought that we would have to wait a while since we didn't see any open tables inside when we walked by. However, we also noticed that there's this heated shed in front, with a few other tables, and so we went inside.We ordered two dishes, and since my companion couldn't deal with protein, he opted for the vegetarian string beans and rice. I on the other hand had a nasi goreng with duck. Oh, that was fantastic.See, I rarely get good Indonesian food here in Berlin. I guess my expectations were high given what I have tasted in Amsterdam. So I am glad I found this place, because it definitely delivers. I will definitely be back to try their other dishes, as there is an extensive selection."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/6/16,"Traveling from Brunei and happened upon this cute Indonesian restaurant. I wasn't expecting to get such delicious, authentic Indonesian food so far from South East Asia! I had the ayam pecel (fried chicken with spicy sambal with rice, tofu and tempeh) and my husband had the nasi goreng ayam (chicken fried rice). We both left feeling very satisfied! The service was also impeccable - super friendly and fast. We met the owner who was quirky, funny and very welcoming. All in all, we had a great time and would easily recommend this to anyone!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/24/16,"Amazing and authentic Indonesian food with great prices and large portions. Most of the food tasted like they were from the Sumatra/Bali region. We had beef rendang, crispy duck with mixed vegetables and rice, crispy duck with curry and rice, bihun goreng and plenty of kerupuk to boost. Dessert was goreng pisang with vanilla ice cream. Everything that was laid on our table was 100% authentic and tasted wow. We had 6 different kinds of Chilli and Sambal and just perfect with kerupuk and rice. The service was outstanding and this is a place we would visit over and over again. Highly recommended hole in the wall and come very hungry!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/11/16,"I dont give many 5 stars, not to sound like a snob... but this place is totally deserving. Its hard to find, similar to a hole in the wall, but much cleaner, and is a total gem. Probably my best kept berlin secret :). Food is very good for the price, reminiscent of very good street food. Highly recommend, cant say more good things without this review sounding like fluff, so pls try it out."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/21/16,"Four stars for the price, we've found better food while here in Berlin, but for the price it couldn't be beat. I had the crispy duck fried rice something you don't find too often in Texas, and gladly finished it all."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/26/16,The best Indonesian food I have ever had. Good sized portions served relatively quickly for a very good price. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget eat in Berlin.
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/17/16,"We landed in Berlin, tired and hungry. We were staying at a hotel nearby and came here for dinner, assuming they take credit card. We had a great meal and in the middle we realize to ask if they take credit card, and it turns out they do not - cash only. But the owner was very friendly with us and told us we can just pay him back another day, and he said so with a smile on his face. It was such a warm welcome to his city of Berlin. We did have dollars since we were coming from the United States, and he said no problem pay in dollars or come back another day with euros. He was very kind and genuine and it gave us positive energy. Pretty memorable. We ended up paying in dollars. The food by the way was delicious and really really reasonably priced for the quality."
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/12/15,"Quick, filling, and scrumptious first encounter with Indonesian food! I had the rendang, a classic Indonesian dish consisting of braised beef and green beans coated in a paste with ginger, chili, and spices. I barely finished my dish and could not move for a good 10 minutes. My boyfriend had the duck orange, a fried duck breast in a tasty orange glaze, which was also delicious. We arrived around 19:00 and grabbed the very last spot outside, in the little straw hut. It was a random Tuesday night and a line started forming for the restaurant shortly after we arrived. Mabuhay is evidently a favorite among locals, so get there early!"
Mabuhay,Indonesian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/8/16,"Authentic Indonesian taste! Big portion costs less than EUR 10, everything comes with rice and EUR 5 for Mittagsmenu.

Boccondivino,Italian,4,?11-20,5,4/7/16,"Had a delightful meal here.  Authentic Italian staff prepared fresh homemade pasta dishes.  Decor was lovely.  Waiter was friendly and witty and provided good recommendations for unusual Italian red wines, including one from his home town, in charmingly accented German and English.  Wild truffle pasta initially appeared too plain, but actually had a delicious flavor.  Dinner for two including wine was under 50?."
Boccondivino,Italian,4,?11-20,2,1/26/18,"Drawn here by the great reviews an hour before a Brecht performance at Berlin Ensemble a block away, we were looking forward to some authentic upmarket Italian food. The menu certainly does not disappoint. It is well-balanced between simple tourist-pleasing standards and elegant-sounding dishes trumpeting exotic ingredients with nouveau-riche enthusiasm, and wide-ranging, with pastas, antipastos, meats, and fish all solidly represented. Monkfish, bison entrecot, three kinds of seafood carpaccio.The staff are attentive when you first arrive, seat you, take an oddly long time to read you the half-Italian, half-German menu in English, and take your drink order quite quickly, but at least on this Thursday at 7pm it would have been a good idea to order two drinks right away, because although the drinks arrived quickly, 15 minutes elapsed after they arrived while the waiter rushed around serving other tables. To his credit, he was fast, but for the number of tables, the restaurant is understaffed enough that the waiter has to avoid eye-contact with the new table for 15 minutes after getting them their initial drink order.Once he finally showed at our table again, an honest and friendly exchange ensued where I voiced my concern, having by then 30m at best to finish a meal that had not yet started. The waiter proudly exclaimed that everything took a loong time to come out of the kitchen because it's all so amazingly fresh, (including the cheese and brined olives??,) so we cashed out.Still curious to try a sampling of their cuisine, we asked what time they close, and the waiter said: ""don't worry. We're open 'till midnight!"". It would have been considerate after we mentioned that we would then return at 11 to tell us that ""open 'till midnight"" is only on Fridays, not this evening...Returning at 11 and walking through an open front door we were met by a judgy man admonishing us that it was closed (ever think of closing the front door, then?) - Let's just say we'll be happy to live without further adventures in Boccondivino customer service..."

Boccondivino,Italian,4,?11-20,5,1/7/16,"Just saw a review ""This is my favorite Sicilian restaurant in Berlin. They make a great pizza but the kitchen really shines with the seafood dishes."" I am surprised - no pizza on the menu. It's not a pizzeria, it's a very nice italian ristorante - and the six of us all had different starters and entrees and were very happy. I will sure go there again."
Boccondivino,Italian,4,?11-20,3,6/6/16,"My friend and I were in Berlin for just a couple of days, and so far we have not been especially impressed with the food options. This place seemed nice when we walked by it during the day, so we stopped in for dinner at around 9:30 on a Monday night.It was pretty busy, and they didn't have a hostess per say, so we sort of asked the bartender to be seated. It took about 10-15 min for someone to get to the table, but they were very nice. Just slow. The menu was on the chalkboard, as was the wine. I ordered a red wine for 7 euros, awful but cheap. Then we ordered food. Bread came - it was not great bread. Food came fast, I had mushroom risotto and my friend had a truffle and cheese pasta. They were both pretty good, but not excellent. Then it took another 25 min after we finished eating to get the check.Overall, decent food (especially for the price), and they were very nice, but not attentive."
Boccondivino,Italian,4,?11-20,1,5/25/15,"I'm not sure if the people leaving good reviews here are real or not. After enduring 16hours of flight from Singapore to Berlin, I wanted to finally have nice food in a nice environment. Since reviews are all good on Foursquare, Tripadvisor, Google, my friends and I decided to give this place a shot for lunch. We ordered ricotta and spinach cannelloni, with vegetable and beet soup, and I ordered some kind of pasta with shrimps and lobster sauce.1) We were served bread and olives. I wonder what happened to the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.2) The waiter was always hovering around and eavesdropping. Or maybe seeking validation or hoping that we're gonna go all ""oh wow awesome food"" (which didn't happen).3) The cannelloni with ricotta and spinach was bland. But it was slightly better than my dishful of hate pasta.4) My pasta (the shrimp with lobster sauce) was obviously cooked with hate. The shrimps were made from frozen, it was bland and texture was meh. The sauce? I didn't taste any lobster, instead all I had was salt and huge chunks of garlic. A vampire would have fled in horror if he saw the chunks of garlic in my pasta. Even my boyfriend thought that maybe they heard that I mention that the soup tastes home-made, and as a result, they probably cooked me a dishful of hate.So God knows where all these good reviews came from. Is it because they hate life, or just hate asians, or hate non-italians, or is it because we aren't the usual demographic of the fancy Mitte business people, that we don't deserve a good meal even though we're paying for it? I would not recommend this place at all to anyone who wants to. Spend your money elsewhere, in a restaurant that takes pride in serving good food to people.Visited May 2015"

We ordered 5 different Tapas (meat, veg, seafood, cheese) and were utterly disappointed by the lack of seasoning, flavor and authenticity.

Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,1,6/17/17,"Walked in around 6PM today expecting to get friendly service and a great German meal. Place wasn't very packed at all, definitely saw four or five tables open. I asked for a table for three (spoke with the person who is in all the photos) and he just shook his head and said no with absolutely zero explanation. I took note of the fact that everyone eating there was white and I can only assume that me being Korean had something to do with the fact that he was so abrupt and rude.Super bummed out that I missed out on a great German meal but if you're going to be racist I can spend my money elsewhere."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,4,10/22/16,"Excellent food and very good service. Only complaints: inside was reserved at 5 pm on a Saturday, though we were able to sit outside with heaters; and two of our first-choice dishes were sold out. That said, the food was great and I would certainly go here again. Menu has a large selection of German and Berliner specialities. The sauerbraten was sold out, but I had the Zille Teller, which was a lightly sweet-and-sour pork bits in slabs of aspic, with sliced onions, remoulade, and a green salad. My friends had the soup of the day as a starter and raved about it; I had the kartoffelpuffer (thin fried potato pancakes/croquettes) with smoked salmon and a bit of green salad, also great."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,4,4/7/17,"Authentic German restaurant for a pair price. Definitely recommend the Goulash, bit everything else looked good too!"
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,5/22/17,Best German meal ! Great service and food. Reasonably priced! A must go! The esibein and scnitzel were superb!
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,2,11/19/16,"Good service but food is not tasty :( potato salad was sour :(good mulled wine though"
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,8/17/16,"Great homemade food and quaint location! The price is awesome, given the quality and size of each portion.  It is located a few steps from the overly touristic places in the river.  They area family run business with great German food and the place has a great vibe with gorgeous plants and comfortable furniture. If you need a break on your way to Museum Island this restaurant is the perfect place."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,3/29/17,"Two for one! Whilst searching for a decent feed in Berlin I stumbled across YELP. It recommended the Boulevard Friedrichstrasse which I tried. It was fabulous. Authentic Berlin meal, superb beer and great atmosphere. I recommend Yelp and Boulevard Friedrichstrasse"
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,3/4/16,"We ate here for dinner the first night in Berlin, then for lunch the next day too...the vibe is different for different times, and food is always delicious. For a fair price, some of the dishes like the Mixed Grill is such a huge portion. I recommend the steak with the sauce and hash browns. Beer is alway good too!"
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,7/26/16,"Large size of food, very yummy with reasonable price. The place is nearby S Bahn station, easy to reach. I order Schnitzel, two large fried pork slice including sour potato and salad as shown in the pic."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,1,12/20/16,"We stopped here to eat before a show. Asked if we could have a table for 2. He said in ""No"" we look around and see 3 empty tables nevertheless we go to leave then he says ""ok, here"" and points to a table. We watch he man visits three tables around us.  The deliverers drinks to all the surrounding tables even the ones outside our window. 15-20 minutes go by and he hasn't even come up to ask us what we wanted to drink. Not sure if it was because we were American or what but, we got up and left. Still they didn't even acknowledge that we were leaving."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,10/26/16,"Food was excellent, authentic, and reasonably priced. Location was also ideal as it was just over the bridge from our hotel. Also right next to one of the main theaters in town. The interior was cozy and noise level ideal. My wife had a delicious plate of Schnitzel and I had an excellent fish dish. The best part, the service. The wait staff was friendly and genuine with their interactions and I would definitely recommend this for someone near the area looking for a great German meal. Stop in, grab a large beer, and enjoy the hospitality."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,2/10/16,"We arrived in Berlin on a Saturday afternoon and were absolutely starving! Most things were closed that day but we were lucky to have found this restaurant. We ordered the potato soup, mixed grill and the pork knuckle and they were all delicious!! Service was also great. The good food made for a nice start for our time in Berlin :)"
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,3,11/8/16,"This place is very cool. The staff is awesome and the space is comfortable, especially outside if the weather is nice."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,3,12/13/15,"This place is very uncomplicated. Simple good quality food at reasonable prices. Quick and friendly service. The pork steak and potatoes I had was very tasty without being the largest portion. The deserts were again good. There is nothing amazing about this place but there is nothing bad either. Recommend if you want a quick, cheap meal of a good standard. That's why it's getting 3 stars."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,4,7/26/15,"A small restaurant with lots of outside seating.  We ordered our usual veal, schnitzel, and steak.  All the food was good but the steak was just ok.  The schnitzel came with a German potato salad which was quite tasty.  We had an amazing waiter who enjoyed joking around with us.  The outside seating was very pleasant and relaxing.  We decided to stay for desert.  I got the blueberries with ice cream which I enjoyed.  Overall it was a very pleasant experience."
Boulevard Friedrichstrasse,German,4,Under ?10,5,3/18/16,"The ambiance isn't great, but the food portions and desserts are incredible! The potato salad has little pieces of bacon in it and the schnitzel was perfect."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,5,1/29/15,"A great Spanish experience in the heart of Berlin!It's more a tapas restaurant than a tapas bar even if you can indeed sit at the bar and enjoy the tapas. Order 2 or 3 tapas per person (depending on whether you're very hungry and whether you want a dessert at the end!) and get some refined, delicious, varied samples of Spanish cuisine. The avocado tartar, the little fried sardines, the goat cheese wrapped in sesame seeds... yummy yummy and don't forget one order of patatas bravas per person! (strangely enough they call them ""papas bravas"" here - anyway they're perfect with their garlic mayonnaise)Atame is the name of a famous Almodovar film (Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! in the English version) and you'll find posters of his other movies all over the walls. This, and the stacked bottles of wine decorating the walls make a very nice atmosphere. Cool music too (if you like Morcheeba :-) ), not too loud, not too low -?and since the waiters are friendly, genuinely Spanish and quick to bring you good stuff to your table, I see no reason why this wouldn't be a perfect dinner!PS: prices a bit higher than the Berlin standard (about 30 ? per person if you indulge, which is recommended) but the quality of the food justifies it completely."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,7/18/16,"A honest tapas place with good wine - we had chorizo, piementos de padron .... nice view to the Fernsehturm if u r sitting outside - super nice staff - speaks not too bad Spanish too ;-)) - a little bit in the not so cheap side - but who care's if the food and atmosphere is good!"
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,3/29/14,"Came here after seeing all the reviews on Yelp. It was great to see a tapas place in Berlin. The food was good and portions were plentiful. Prices seemed ok, but I have been living in London so they seemed cheaper to me than what I read on other reviews. I had the fried goat cheese with honey and caramelized onions to start. Heaven. The gambas al ajillo were great and the sauce was nice and garlicky - perfect for dunking your bread into. I also got the grilled scallops with artichokes  which were ok but nothing special. The only miss of the night. I didn't even need to order them as portion sizes were pretty decent. I paired it with a glass of Tempranillo and I was transported back to Barcelona. Service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was packed and the waiters and waitresses were hopping around from table to table. My waitress did stop by a few times to ask if everything was 'bueno.'  I would definitely come back if I am in Mitte."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,3,7/17/16,Not recommended for just drinks. The service was slow and the music was on very low volume. The food might be good but if you're looking for a fun bar this isn't the place for you.
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,5,10/11/15,"Wonderful night out.Food was tasty and reasonably pricedWine was great.Good experience!"
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,2,4/4/15,"A good looking tapas bar near Alexanderplatz. The Yelp reviews were very promising and when we came in at 18:00h almost all tables were pre-booked. Fortunately we got a table and the drinks were served very quickly. The menu gave choice to order the tapas in 2 sizes. We ordered three items and chose the biggest portions. Considering the price we expected that this would be almost enough as a main course for both of us. The tapas tasted ok. Not very special, just ok. But the portions were really small! After a quick calculation we figured a full dinner would set us back at least ?75,- for 2 persons including 2 drinks each so we decided to ask for the bill. We are from the Netherlands so we are used to crazy prices for eating out. Germany and even Berlin is considerable cheaper than my country so this is really expensive for an average tapas restaurant in my opinion. Sorry guys, the food was ok but not worth this kind of money. Oh yes, and despite the price, they don't take credit cards. Also the place needs to be vacuum cleaned more often!"
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,2/26/13,"I had lunch at this place today as a friend of mine told me it was good. I had the Men? del D?a, asparagus soup to start which was very nice and then grilled prawns with salad and a nice sauce. Then finished it all off with a Crema Catalana and coffee. The menu came with a glass of wine and a glass of water as well.From my experience today this is an authentic Spanish restaurant. Two of the staff were even Spanish and that way I was sure of what I was getting. They've even got Pa amb tom?quet.I didn't ask if they name comes from the Almod?var film but I'm pretty sure. This review was written in 2008."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,4/1/14,"Nice place, tasty food and quite pricy. We sat inside and spent a nice evening. But we may not be coming back, cause the food seems a bit overpriced."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,8/17/15,"The food came quickly and the portions were reasonable to split between two people. The wait staff were friendly. My friend and I ordered quite a few tapas and finished them all, a sight to which the waitress responded with congratulations: it was a good time. The prices were also reasonable. I would recommend this place to others."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,5/3/15,Food was very good. Not super good variety but very good taste. They didn't accept any credit card other than Maestro based system.
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,2/7/12,"I went here with a friend in the hopes of finding proper spanish tapas and I was not disappointed. The inside is very nice and the lighting gives it a calm, but southern flair. We ordered 5 tapas (plentiful as the portions are a but bigger (that's why the prices are a bit higher than one would expect from ""regular"" tapas). Nonetheless, the food was delicious (we had the calamaris, pimientos, patatas bravas, croquetas, and gambas)  and the staff (which is spanish) is very friendly.  All in all, it's a nice place and I would/will definitely come back."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,5,9/4/11,"The food is not cheap here, but very good. I have been at Atame at least 10 times already and I just love it. The goat cheese marinated with honey and herbs is awesome, also the aioli and the olives.I just came back from Barcelona and I dare to say: As far as Catalan food goes, Atame can totally compete."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,3,6/1/10,"Good tapas in Mitte. We were there for lunch and had the special. I started off with a seafood soup, followed by steak. Price-wise a pretty good deal. The soup was so-so. The steak was surprisingly good. Hence I'm lukewarm on the food as one dish was really good and one quite weak. Those I was with also weren't impressed by their soups yet also found the main course to be significantly better. I found staff a bit uninterested but it was quite busy and they were bustling around. All in all OK. I simply wasn't as impressed with this place as many people seem to be. I'll have to come back at some point and try other dishes as well as see if staff were having a rough day. Easily reachable in Mitte. Outdoor seating is also available but only a couple of tables out front."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,5,8/3/09,"This is one of my favorite places in Berlin. I've already been there 6-7 times. It's not particularly cheap, but the food is excellent."
Atame Tapas Bar,Tapas Bars,4,?21-40,4,9/19/09,"I go there a lot when I have a craving for a decent ""cortado"" (about EUR2.00). I've only eaten there once (tortilla de patatas) and I enjoyed that very much. As others have pointed out, it can be pricey but the food seems worth it. Be careful when you're ordering soft drinks. They are shockingly expensive even at 0.2 litres. I had to pay nearly 4 euros for a large fanta!"
Stock und Stein,German,4.5,?21-40,5,12/1/16,"Most amazing place for a date or a cozy dinner with friends. You cook the food on a hot stone in front of you on the table, the meat and dips for the bread were exquisit and the wine was really great!"
Stock und Stein,German,4.5,?21-40,4,2/19/17,"This wonderful gem gets four ""G's"": Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and great beer.I'm usually very picky but i've no complaints here. Food portions are quite generous and delicious. I'd give it a 5th star but Yelp seems to get suspicious of 5 star reviews.  Oh, the beer is unpasteurized Pilsner Urquell. Pretty tasty. Almost forgot to mention right next door is a great place to dance on weekends at midnight called "" Su? war Gestern."" For a fun date, have dinner here and go dancing there!"
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/9/15,"This place was great. I lived in Italy for 6 months and the food here was on par with authentic Italian cuisine. The staff/owner were also very friendly, you can tell they really want you to have a wonderful meal. Highly recommended!"
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/22/17,Went on a Monday night - not crowded. Great local find. Ordered a mozzarella and tomato antipasti. Got spaghetti carbonara and spaghetti bolognese for dinner - both were outstanding. Large portions for very reasonable prices.
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/16/16,"My boyfriend and I had a craving for Italian while visiting Berlin, and found Peperonico through Yelp. It was a darling spot right on the corner by a park. With such a nice view, we chose to sit outside so we could people watch and enjoy the scenery.We kicked things off with a caprese salad and some wine. For entrees, I had a mushroom pasta and my date had a pretty simply red sauce pasta dish. Mine was delicious, while his was a little basic. Thankfully, the portions were colossal so he could share some of mine since it was better.Our server was a sweetheart and made it that much better of a dinner."
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/20/16,"We came here for my son's birthday.  He wanted Italian.  It was not a busy night, so we had two servers waiting on our table of seven people.  We had the mushroom with garlic appetizer, and the artichokes in a cream sauce.  Both were delicious.  The mushrooms had lots of garlic which was a delicious change from other food we've had in Berlin.  The artichokes were good, and my kids devoured a basket of bread finishing up the sauce.Dinner was also good.  My ravioli with almonds and an alfredo sauce was delicate and delicious without being too heavy.  Note that the tuna salad, while delicious, is enormous.  It is not a one-person serving.  Share it with a friend.If we lived here, this would be our go-to Italian restaurant.  The kitchen head was by our table several times to assess our happiness, which is a touch I appreciated."
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,8/18/14,"I really enjoyed this place, even if I did need to be rolled home after our 6-course meal! We did the surprise menu, which was fun because you name your price and then they give you as many courses as they see fit for that. We decided to be fancy and went with ?25 each, which got us 6 delicious courses. I think if I went back, I would go with a big bowl of their homemade pasta instead. However, I thoroughly enjoyed our huge meal and liters of wine. The service was great, albeit a bit slow, but that was fine with me since he was back there whipping every course up as he went. The chef even came out and checked on all of us, which shows how much they care about the quality of food. This is a great place for a date and I definitely recommend it!"
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/8/13,"We went for a Sunday dinner with a close friend. We had read some reviews beforehand and can clearly say we weren't disappointed. The food was great and while simple with eye for detail. The service was friendly and the owner and chef made us feel at home in no time. Ambience is that of a typical Italian trattoria and certainly not fancy. But once again: simplicity is what drives the comfortable feel of the place. The prices were very low. Needless to say we were happy to give a nice tip."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,10/28/16,"Whilst traveling Europe, I became so enthralled with Spanish Tapas, to the point where I tried to find a clutch Tapas restaurant in every city I visited. Unfortunately, many cities could not develop the full Spanish flavors I was searching for. Then I found Mariona. And I fell in love. I went there multiple times in the three times I visited Berlin. Each time, I was not disappointed.   The tapas, though small dishes (priced around 8-9 Euros), were completely drenched in richness, both in flavor and textures. Particularly, their braised rabbit in apricot reduction (Summer). This dish was satisfying to the point where my Boyfriend and I returned twice within 3 days, just so we could indulge in the richness again.The chocolate and cheese dish looks deceiving, in that, at first glance, one may feel like the portion was not enough to satisfy one's appetite, but the richness was more than enough to satisfy the palette. We have this dish almost every time that it is on the menu, since it isn't restricted by the seasons. The dishes were aesthetically pleasing as well, almost too pretty to each, but who could resist, one bite in and you are sold.   We would have 1-3 dishes total, and be full and satisfied. Oh heck, we were fat happy babies after each meal. The portions were perfect for the intensity of the flavors. I have to admit, we did not order the entrees, because the tapas are the star of the show at this place, and since 2 tapas plates equals the price of one entree, I felt more satisfied enjoying a variety of dishes instead of a full on plate. This seems to be a family restaurant, with simple, rustic decor, and nice service (our waiter even remembered us from a year earlier when we had come). There is a variety of wines to suit any palate. Disclaimer: the place is small and gets crowded quite fast, so making a reservation is key if you go around the peak dinner hours. Honestly, if you are looking to indulge your flavor palate with beautiful and rich flavors, this place is a hidden gem."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,2,3/19/16,"You can not get 18? for small dish of pasta when the tagliatella is not done by yourself, the mushrooms are from a supermarket conserve.The ""pulpo a la gallega"", crunchy octopus? it had a plastic texture and the portion was really small, with potatoes overheated on the grill.But the wine selection was really good as well as the Crema Catalana / panacotta desert. Maybe i will give them another chance but i will not spend again almost 100? for 2 people with this quality.From other side, the service and the atmosphere where very nice."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,12/27/15,"Okay expensive, but the quality is worth every Euro. The staff is sweet, atmosphere nice, you get here everything you want for a romantic dinner with best spanish food."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,8/1/14,"Unique berlin restaurant experience - in the heart of kreuzberg with a view of the U1. Very good tapas. Enjoyed the razor clams - rarely on menus - very simple with olive oil; amazing duck confit with carrots, celery; fantastic pulpo al gallego.  Larger portions than usual Spanish tapas. Service was spotty - the waitress seemed out to lunch and when we ordered a bottle of wine she brought a different bottle already open explaining that the one we ordered was too warm. Fun to watch the chef clean up shirtless to techno music - sooooooo berlin! Will be back for more."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,11/27/15,"One of the best restaurant experiences one can possibly have in this city. We came in a large group, and the attentive staff went out of their way to make sure we are enjoying the food. As a vegan, i had very little hope that the Catalan regional kitchen has anything to offer me. I was pleased to see the effort they took, without the usual Berliner frowning face, to create good satisfying dishes for me- including dessert! Definitely coming back, to also try some other wines from their very impressive selection."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,6/26/15,"I was in Berlin for 3 weeks during which we had 2 amazing dinners at Mariona. One consisted of creative delicious tapas and fabulous wines that you can not get in the US (IPEX). This was a delightful and delicious experience. We sat inside once in the traditional Spanish ambiance and once outside to enjoy the summer evening . Giuseppe   chose our appetizers and main course - and was friendly, informative and inspiring- in a very humble way. I could have eaten there every night- what a gem! Especially loved the Pulpa, the scallops, the rabbit and the creme brulee. The menu seems to change daily - lots of variety. I am a fan- make a reservation though, the word is out - it is the place to go for ambiance, friendly service, incredibly delicious and creative food and superb wines."
Mariona,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,8/12/11,"I was honestly surprised to find a place in berlin where i could eat something more than just durums and schnitzel.. yes ok, compared to other places in the neighbourhood it was a little over priced. but i came here on vacations right after been in stuttgart, and trust me. not only i payed the double down there, but i was also critizised for not speaking german. and beleive me, i didnt eat more than just germanys famous schintzel in brown sauce to end it. im a cook, and i was a bit offended by seen such little motivation in germany to everything envolving food.. i think now days, eating is one of the most important things in our lifes and another thing i know, is that overpricing, is not something we just see in restaurants.. you should see my house bills the only difference, is that there i dont have choice, and worst of all, i dont have the right to complain. so mariona congrats you where i highlight for me and my family in our short but lovely visit to berlin good luck with your work. Thanks."
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/11/17,"This doner kebab changed my life. I have NEVER had such an amazing doner, EVER. A local friend took us here, as the other more touristy ones were way too long of a wait, and he said this was more and the same. OMG, can't stress enough how delicious this doner was.First off, get the classic. You can't go wrong. Then, they add grilled veggies in it. Usually, doners are meat-heavy, so this was a great and unique touch. Then, they slice the chicken doner in front of you, and add it to the sandwich bread. Which btw, is fluffy and toasted and complete with SESAME SEEDS. I will recommend this place to everyone that visits Berlin. Everyone must go here. Though selfishly I don't want them to gain that much traction so next time I come there will be an hour wait. AMAZING."
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/21/17,"Guest review from a friend haha:Hey folks if you're interested in something outstanding then check out berlins best Gem?se kebab at kottiwood. Fresh veg, homemade falafel, homemade sauce, tasty fried veg, two different kinds of bread to choose from and a whole lotta flavor! Been there hundreds of times and it's only getting better. Lately they also changed their whole interior into a wooden themed forest kinda look...compared to the average d?ner bude in Berlin a real eye catcher haha Fun fact: Kottiwood made the 1th place on the german tv show ""Mein Lokal, dein Lokal!""What I gotta add: I always get the halloumi plate with a drink of choice which is under 6 bucks. It's a huge plate with halloumi, salad, fried veg, rice and sauces. One of the few places where you get a lot of good yummy food for this little money"
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,12/2/15,"Went there only once.The Chicken Gem?se d?r?m was very good, but it was somewhat too oily and heavy.Maybe it was just this one time, but I still recommend it"
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/22/15,"Good price, perfect D?rum, nice filling. Some really spicy chili available on the counter. Staff can be really nice or really impolite, depending on who talks to you. Free tea!"
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/1/15,"Probably one of my favourite gemuse kebap places in Berlin. The meat is nice, the bread is good, the sauces are tasty, there's a nice little sprinkling of cheese, and to top it all off the potatoes are cooked to perfection. They also have a good range of local beers, and some extra chilli on the counter if you fancy some more heat (Justin Bieber ""for babies"" and Rambo ""for real men""). If you're hungry for a good kebap, it's a good choice."
Kottiwood,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/16/15,"Top 5 d?ner in Berlin. Chicken/vegetable kebab done very well. They have a fun staff, awesome environment, and free wifi. I would suggest the h?hnchen gem?se durum kebab with extra sauce."
Begur,Spanish,4.5,?21-40,4,10/17/15,"Seems like our friend ""Chris M"" didn't actually go in to the restaurant but just peered through the windows like an edgy lifestyle rebel - right on! Yes, this is certainly not the kind of place you would have found in Neuk?lln until recently (for the record, I first moved to the district in the mid 90's). It's early days but we found the welcome friendly and the cuisine really very good - we had the lamb (""Geschmort met Orangen"") and the veal which were served with a small selection of vegetables (green beans, potatoes). The quality was excellent, portions not large (as to be expected, to be honest). Wines good and reasonable by the glass. The winner was the dessert, especially ""Tres texturas de chocolate"". Fazit: more special occasion than everyday, but a proper restaurant by any standard. Give it a go, but keep an eye out for a snotty individual lurking around outside."
L?Assaggino,Italian,5,?11-20,5,1/29/11,"what a place! It's like coming home to the nicest family, and they make you the best dinner you can imagine. I had the pasta bolognese, which was magical. So simple, but so tastefull. They even gave us the rest of the bolognese when we went home to have for next day, because it was soon christmas, and they would close for a few days anyway, so why waist food.The staff is so friendly, as I said, you feel like home. Usually if you visit at restaurant and there are no other patrions, you feel a bit uncomfortable, but not at all at L'assaggino. Good music, wonderful wine, and we are definitely going back."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/13/16,"Ok this beef d?ner is delicious. The beef was very flaky and almost too dry for me but my brother seems to like it a lot (so maybe personal preference) but I do like the bread here a lot! For only ?3 you are guaranteed to leave your stomach full and satisfied :) plus, great service and no line and nice seating area"
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/2/17,"i saw Imren being recommended by a lot of different people online, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. I ordered the doner kebab, and it was only ?3.50. the bread was warm and crispy on the outside. the beef was on the drier side, but the sauces made up for it. the sauces and the bread were what made the doner delicious. the place was full of locals which is how you know it's good. i think i liked mustafa's vegetarian doner more, but Imren has more options and meat. another plus is that the line is way shorter and you can eat inside which is helpful in the cold weather."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/5/17,"Lentil soup was very good, I have had better gyro/Donner.  Bread was excellent, minus unsanitary handling of the money and then the bread.  Overall good but I wouldn't go a long distance to come here."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/16/16,"Delicious beef d?ner for ?3.50. The meat was cooked very well and would've been on the dry side if not for its seasonings and the delicious sauce in the d?ner. The veggies are very fresh and the d?ner is managable to both finish and to stay relatively cleanly. The bread is pretty good as well, though it got kind of tough at the bottom of the sandwich. I also saw several people sitting around us with Turkish tea, which looked really good as well. If I lived in Berlin, I'd probably be a regular here. Definitely come if you're looking for solid traditional d?ner; they also serve durum, soups, mixed plates, etc."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/2/16,Great price and great food! The place is a little small and when it gets busy I can imagine that its hard to find a seat. I highly recommend for a unique and authentic food experience.
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,2,7/21/16,"There was a very large list of good reviews about Imren Grill a friend and I had seen. We wanted to try the best kebabs in Berlin, and this was supposed to be the best (yes, even better than the so well known Mustafa) and I couldn't be more let down. The d?ner was in his majority filled with lettuce, and the meat was actually roasted beef, which I found pretty weird. I wouldn't recommend it if you're willing to try the few best."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/2/16,"Great d?ner but I prefer chicken d?ner! This place is beef, I believe. It's delicious!! And they give you a large amount of food for very cheap prices. Since its beef, it feels a lot heavier. I felt so full after my meal!! I prefer d?ner that's not as intense but I would certainly recommend this place to others."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/2/16,"This place is a gem. We went there twice in our trip to Berlin. The star is of course the dark meat d?ner here. It is proper meat cut in slices and marinated and then layered on the d?ner rotisserie stick and cooked to perfection. We had the d?ner teller Mir reis. And this was the perfect choice. The rice is a typical Turkish rice. The fat from the meat slowly settles down in the rice and gives it a great flavour. The ayran (yoghurt drink) here is prepared fresh with the creamy froth. And it tastes yum! I feel like I could write a poem on it. I invited them to start their little restaurant also in Cologne so that I can enjoy it more often."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/9/15,"Shawarma was excellent. Tasted very authentic with a good amount of meat. Price was excellent at only 3 euros. It's a little small though so you will probably need to order something else too. Also had some pide. That was okay but similar to what I've had at other places. It is also great value at 3 euros. They sell a fairly large range of food including marinated meats. Note that this place is a different shop to Imren burger and pizza, which is just down the street."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,1,1/26/17,"Very disappointed. Went out of the way to visit here based on the reviews. The pide was the worst I've ever had. I actually thought the pide was part of a display. They were all old and stacked up on the counter. At best, it was one day old. While it's relatively cheap, I paid one euro more last week at Zeus to get pide made fresh when I ordered. Why sell people pide this old? The fact that they grabbed an old pide and microwaved it also meant that everyone ate at very different times. The bread had a weird chemical taste and the meat was mediocre. Ultimately, we left almost all of our food on the table after freezing in dining room and going home with upset stomachs."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/14/16,"Good bang for the buck, we ordered the doner wrap well seasoned and tasty I highly recommend."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/4/16,"A bit out of the way, but hands down the best d?ner in Berlin. The meat here is top quality -- soft, delicate, and well-seasoned. There are also a variety of other dishes to accompany your sandwich like Turkish pizza (lahmacun -- a must try) and many Turkish desserts you can't easily find in Berlin. The prices are very reasonable. In the summer, there are lots of flies everywhere, but if you are used to international holes-in-the-wall places, you will overlook that in a heartbeat.  The flavors represented here are authentic and even better than food I had in Turkey."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/18/15,"Wow, this was the best Turkish food I had when I was in Berlin. It was just a 5-10 minute walk from my hostel, and Yelpers mentioned, it was a pretty amazing schwarma for 3 euro. So much flavor. Got it twice during my visit, and I usually never go back to the same restaurant twice when I'm in a new town. This will be on my list of places to go when I come back in the future for sure!"
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/21/16,A great choice for having traditional d?ner in Berlin! Good meat quality and good prices. The staff is efficient and there is plenty of room to sit and eat. We had the schawarma and the durum and both were great.
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/23/15,"One of the few Turkish fast food spots which won't have your body asking what it did to deserve this.Better quality meat than the vast majority of other places.  I opt for the Schwarma version.Everything else has already been said about Imren, they are simply one of the best at what they do."
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/18/16,"The meat is extremely flavorful & flaky. Not the typical pressed/ground meat you get at other d?ner spots.  This is ""real"" meat, that had not been pre-ground... I'm not sure which meat was used, but it tasted like lamb & veal.  My friend ordered a normal d?ner in bread for ?3 and I ordered the small d?ner plate with meat, salad & rice for ?6.  The portions are smaller than I'm accustomed to from other imbisses, but that's understandable- as its about quality, not quantity.  And honestly, these are ""normal human"" portions.  I was full, but not disgustingly so.  Also they offer unlimited free Turkish tea from the samowar near the eating areas.  This place is always super full, but on both occasions I've visited, I managed to get a seat rather quickly, as other guests were just leaving.  The other dishes look good too: daily menus, Adana kabab, iskembe/kelle pa?a soups, etc.  -but  as I'm so seldom in the area, I always end up choosing d?ner. ;-).  Definitely the best d?ner I've had in Berlin this far... Enjoy!"
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/16/15,Another Berlin Turkish institution that serves up some really great tasting stuff. Don't just try the d?ner kebabs. Give their Adana a go or their soups and stews. Really worth it.
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/4/14,"Ok ok, I just got a Pide, but it was really good.  The guy who took my order was also very nice.  They were out of the one I wanted, so he just made me one!"
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/8/14,"Imren on Boppstrasse is my favorite Turkish restaurant in the city, much better than Hassir. I recommend the Adana kebab with yogurt-it's delicious. The best thing here though is dessert. Try the kuenefe, but bring a friend because it's super sweet!"
Imren Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/5/15,best shawarma ever. the turkish pizza is very satisfying too.
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,8/3/17,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with this place. We stumbled in to this restaurant and could not be happier. We were originally seated in the little courtyard behind the restaurant but it started to rain. Our hostess quickly shuffled us inside. Cute and lovely. The food was fresh and outstandingly delicious for a great price. We shared a salad, delicious house dressing (I wish I had a bottle to take home!) and bread. We opted out of any other first dishes or pizza, although the pizza looked fantastic. Both of our pastas, mine was a special with chanterelle mushrooms and my friend had the sausage and mushroom, were outstanding! The food here equals that of what I had in Italy. The house white wine was very good quality as well.My only caution, it's cash only. Make sure that you know that ahead of time. This is what stopped us from pizza and dessert!A must go!"
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,1,7/27/17,"Don't go to this place as they treat foreigners like they're dumb. Told us it was cash only at the end, even though there was a Visa sign. She claimed that there was a sign that said card not working in German. LOLWe went to get cash, while we saw another person paying with card. When we asked, she said ""it only works sometimes"". Proceeded to fake try to use the machine (didn't even actually put the card in). Thanks, but no thanks."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,4,9/20/17,Nice little place on a busy corner! I love the inside of the restaurant and it was very friendly and they took great care of us! The pizza was good but not anything special! I would return because I liked the service and the atmosphere though.
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,6/17/17,"A small, cozy, and comfortable cafe where I enjoyed a savory lasagne, a nice salad, good bread, and a glass of house red for less than 17?. Fast and friendly service and a quiet atmosphere. Just perfect."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,4,7/19/15,"So it was so good that we came back twice in one week - that must mean something right?! Tried the lasagna, risotto, gnocchi, and it was all thumbs up! Great for a party of two or for a group because they have downstairs and upstairs seating."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/29/14,"Our first meal in Berlin was excellent here. Small setting with personable service. Close table setting encouraged conversation with other happy customers. The salads were outstanding. We savor es the truffled gnocchi. The steak and accompanying polenta were excellent. The homemade pasta with putanesca sauce had wonderful al dente texture. A very good restaurant. Cheers."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,12/19/15,"Arrived at 10pm seated without problems and greeted politely. Accommodating to our lack of German language. Ordered, received and out by half 10! That's just because our English nature is to pick up and leave as soon as the food is gone but would easily go back when in Berlin again! Thank you"
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,4,4/25/15,"I found the place nice, good ambience and vibe. Food was tasty but not out of this world. I asked for a Bolognese pasta. It was really tasty but it did not have cheese (which is how we eat it in my home country - I don't really know how Italians do it to be honest). All and all a nice place for enjoying Italian food."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,6/17/14,"Possibly the best meal I had during my nearly 2 week stay in Germany. The salad alone, although simple, was exactly what I had been missing all these days. Great, affordable wine, salad, and pasta. Cute place with great atmosphere. It's Italian food, but reminded me of restaurants in Paris and the south of France more than a typical Berlin restaurant. Their gnocchi is amazing. Recommended."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,4,10/10/14,"The Restaurant is a family type Italian with very good dishes perfectly priced.  We came a family of five for lunch,  had first course Salad and 2 Pizza,  then 5 main course of Pasta,  soft drinks and small beer.  All was very good.  Check was only Euro 61."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/2/13,"Better Italian food than I`ve had anywhere else....including Italy. I`m slightly ashamed to say that not once did I have any German food while staying in Berlin. I blame Bonfini though for entrancing me so with its delicate, balanced flavours and wickedly cheap prices. The tomato soup is perfectly textured and you get wisps of flavour from the cracked black pepper. Tried the tagliatelle, penne with pork and the scampi; I also sampled the spaghetti bolognese and lasagna and they are ALL AMAZING. I think the tagliatelle may even have been house made! Oh and the dessert! For the love of god, try the heavenly tiramisu or the mouth watering panna cotta. The place is small and staffing is minimal so be prepared to wait if it`s busy. Service is excellent though, and the food and ambiance make this place such a gem."
Bonfini,Italian,4,?11-20,4,8/1/15,"Excellent food! Ordered three vegetarian meals and we were all very pleased. Would have liked some Parmesan to what I ordered though, so mention that to the waitress rather than expecting it to be there :)"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,8/27/16,"I've bookmarked this for a while now, and when I finally had the chance to eat here yesterday night, I definitely know why I wanted to go here in the first place. They make really good German food. The thing is, German food is tricky: the things the concept evokes are mostly revolving around beer, sausages, sauerkraut, and pretzels. But there is good German cuisine to be had, you just have to find it. And this one is perhaps one of the few surprising places good German cuisine is offered, especially given its location.I had the eisbein (pork knuckle), after seeing the pictures here. It is quite massive, yet very tender, with the meat falling off the bone easily. As a previous reviewer said, it's not the baked pork knuckle you see elsewhere, where the skin gets thick and chewy and dark. This one keeps its tender quality, and is easily consumed. The flavors are subtle for my taste, and I used some seasonings they have on the table. But nevertheless, this is prime traditional comfort food. It may not be gourmet or haute cuisine, but it definitely earns plenty of points in authenticity.They also have plenty of beer choices, of course, all well within the traditional beer spectrum that you always find in Germany. But nevertheless their selections are quite good.They have inside and outside tables, and generally the atmosphere is friendly and people speak English in case your German sucks. No credit cards, no debit cards. Cash only."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,1,7/22/17,"To be honest with you, if i could give negative stars I would. I don't believe in giving stars to rude/ unfriendly restaurants. Customers is what makes a business become better. I came here ordered a ""to go"" (grandmother's sick and wanted to try this restaurant) food seems great with yelp reviews, so thought I'd give it a try.Prices were actually pretty high as it is 10+ euros plus for a dish, but I don't mind as long as it's good.Ordered over 30? of food to go food, & an old man between his 50s told me very rudely with an impolite manner that he'll charge me next time 1? per dish because of boxes? Wtf?! How about next time you tell your customers you can't afford ""to go boxes"" ?! Or maybe have a sign to bring your own containers?! Or maybe because I'm Asian and you're throwing a racial discrimination against me? The funniest thing about is, they decided to not even box it! Decided to FOIL it up because they didn't want it in a to go container, which then caused the food to become moist and soggy... I don't appreciate rude businesses like this regardless if the food is good or not, I'll rather waste my money on businesses who's genuine about the importance of customers & their food."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,2,4/30/17,"We're staying nearby and this was the closest place with pork knuckle that had a decent review. We went in and it smelled wonderful and every table that wasn't taken (except the bar) had a reserved placard on it so it must mean it's popular.We got the eisbein (boiled pork knuckle/hock) with potatoes, mashed lentils and sauerkraut and an order of asparagus with potatoes. It took awhile to get the food even though the restaurant was half empty. They put a topping on the potatoes and asparagus that tasted like butter with crunchy panko and it was really off-putting to us. I scraped mine to the side before they could get a chance to adulterate my potatoes more than they already had. The mashed lentils were strange and something I don't care to experience again. This was my first eisbein and it simply isn't as tasty to my taste buds as haxen (cooked in the oven with crispy skin). It lacked much flavor at all and you should eat a bite of that with a bite of sauerkraut in order to pick up some flavor. The service was minimal. They seemed quite busy so it took awhile to get our order in and we got our bill quickly to avoid waiting for the next opportunity to flag someone down. I didn't like the food simply because it's not what I'm used to compared to the other German dishes I've had. Clearly I'm alone in this category as most reviews here are positive and the insane number of people waiting to get seated. We actually saw them turn away 3-4 groups that tried to get in without a reservation. So evidently it has a cult following, but just not to my liking."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,3,4/17/17,"Great service! Food was okay. Had the beef roulade, which was tough and dry. Also had the eisbein, which was good, especially when paired with their delicious sauerkraut and mustard. Good spot for an authentic Berlin experience, and a great value, but would definitely avoid the roulade."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,4,9/15/15,"Tasty German food with excellent service. Our waitress was even kind enough to bring over complimentary shots at one point. Pass on the goulash and instead go for the meatballs and the schnitzel. Outdoor seating, very close to the tram, and cash only!"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,4,5/14/15,"Surprised by this German restaurant, especially considering its location! Even though it's located literally 50 meters from U-bahn Eberswalder Stra?e, it is nice and quiet inside. The food is affordable and good. I had a delicious Schnitzel, and the goulash my girlfriend had tasted good as well. The portions a big (e.g. when you order a side salad or a portion of fries extra). Friendly and helpful staff. We'll be coming back!"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,1/7/16,Friendly place to have a great Eisbein! Seems to be very popular so I highly recommend to book a table to try this very Berliner dish.
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,12/29/15,"Great German food with a typical old-school ""Berliner Kneipe"" atmosphere! Service is also good.Whenever we feel like good German food, we always go back to this place. You cannot go wrong with this restaurant!"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,6/29/16,"They have great eisbein! Not the baked pork knuckle (schweine haxe) you see elsewhere. It is boiled, served pink off the bone with sauerkraut, mashed peas, and boiled potatoes...delicious! My husband had the schnitzel with mushroom sauce, he said the fried potatoes were heavenly and the schnitzel was fried perfectly. Has an authentic vibe and service was great and accommodating to our English speaking."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,3/27/14,"You can't go wrong with this place, that's the Schnitz ! (Sorry....)However be warned, it's rustic German at its best and I reckon you don't get the same welcome if you act like a douche and don't speak German one bit. The matrone is not to be tempered with. 2 of my friends' German is brilliant so we managed to establish good grounds for a good meal.What you get is simple: good quality German food and good quality german beer. And what else do you want on your first evening in Berlin?The pork knuckle was so tender and tasty, with potatoes boiled in a thick, tasty stock, sweet sourkraut. I also tried the shnitzel and it was tender and moist with crispy batter and good chips. The beer kept on coming, we kept on talking and I had to be rolled back to the appartment...all for about ?13/person !I need to learn how to speak German !"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,4,1/26/16,"Cozy room, well prepared food, English menu, reasonably priced, pro servers. All good! Great Pilsner too!!"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,3,9/20/15,"I wouldn't go back here again. I get that this is authentic, but it wasn't good quality. I'm from San Francisco where we pride the source and ingredients of our food and this was straight up pub food and it wasn't great at that. The taste was fine don't get me wrong. Wouldn't recommend..."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,3/1/15,"This is a very typical, traditional and I'm sure 'deliberately preserved' German restaurant. It has a bit of an old-fashioned feel but the menu is exactly what it says on the tin. Good traditional German food. Very friendly (also dog-friendly), restaurant/pub. The food is not fancy or pretentious, it  has a home-made feel about it, probably because it is!The Sauerbraten melts! Superb! I love Asian food but this restaurant really is a gem and shines in the sea of many Asian food places.. A must!"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,9/19/14,"Excellent, friendly, traditional restaurant. Schnitzels really good. Personable and efficient service with a great range of schnapps for after your meal. Plus really good prices. Try your German, no matter how bad. They are very forgiving and will give you an English menu! I'd go back tomorrow."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,11/19/14,"Authentic German food at its best -- and you'll be pleased you made the trek to PBerg to visit this restaurant!  I've been here before (a year ago) and was excited to introduce Zum Shusterjungen to an American friend who was visiting Berlin for the first time. I am so glad I asked if they served beef Rouladen, which was not listed on the regular menu, because it was excellent.  My friend had the Berliner-style pork knuckle and loved it.  I will definitely return to Zum Shusterjungen on any future visits to Berlin."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,4,3/4/14,"Great German meal. Schnitzel, cauliflower and chips.   My wife had stuffed red pepper with pork filling and cauliflower soup.  I also had the meat spicy soup that was excellent."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,7/23/14,"Fantastic German fare for ?6-9 euro, great beer, friendly service. Fantastic little local pub, will visit again many times :)"
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,2,9/7/15,"Meh.  While the service was very good, the food was less than average.  The highly rated dumplings were quite undercooked. The mains were not that good (braised beef & smoked ham).  Does NOT take credit cards."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,5,7/16/14,"Authentic restaurant. We were 6 persons in the afternoon, so restaurant was not busy. We ordered schnitzel and it was delicious. The waiter was a nice woman, did not speak a lot of English, but communicated well in all other possible ways. Prices extremely good. I definitely recommend and expect to return myself next time I'm in Berlin."
Zum Schusterjungen,German,4,?11-20,4,7/12/13,"A great German pub, we visited one cold night and the place was packed. So we ate at the bar and started with a few drinks. The food portions were large. I had the schnitzel and loved the little fried potatoes and peas served with it."
Le Compagnon,French,4.5,?21-40,5,6/22/14,"My wife and I had the best dinner of our two week trip to Central Europe at Le Compagnon. The owners/chef/waiters helped us with the menu, the wine, and other questions about Berlin. They speak excellent English and were willing to help with my poor German skills. One dish I ordered was five variations of cauliflower - amazing! We hope to go back before we leave Berlin."
Le Compagnon,French,4.5,?21-40,1,8/8/14,"Sorry, but this is the worst restaurant I've ever been to in Berlin - and I live in the area! First I had spinach with mashed potatos and quail eggs (tasteless, dinner at the age of 9 was more tasty), after that squids with blue potatoes: I couldn't even cut them! At the end of the day, we ended up paying 109,50? for 2 courses, one of them I could not even eat and the waitress excused the cook (her husband) with the following quote: ""he has too much work to do"" ... I am still speachless for such arrogance and lack of professional knowledge."
Le Compagnon,French,4.5,?21-40,5,6/1/12,"This is a fine dining establishment, and we walked in requesting just dessert. They were receptive, friendly, and had excellent service. Only had the dessert here, but blown away. We ordered the grilled melon with fancy french toast and lemon lime sorbet (excellent) and rhubarb jelly with pistachio ice cream and cream (heavenly). I would definitely come back for a dinner and not hesitate at whatever price they charge."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/31/17,"Been coming here frequently ever since they opened. Homemade fresh organic pasta. Daily changing seasonal sauce options. Reasonably priced and always fresh. Very good coffee and freshly squeezed juices.Authentic Italian cuisine, delicious paninis and salads.Everything you want from a lunch spot in berlin."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/15/17,"Great pasta and great service amazing coffee and dessert, the only complaint I have is that they didn't have better wine , but a great little italian caf?"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/11/16,"Delicious pasta and sauce, great derived, just go!A friend of mine went here for our lunch hour from work and we were very satisfied customers!! The pasta was absolutely delicious and home made! Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Berlin - 5 Stars without a doubt!"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/6/16,"What a great little place! I visited on a grey and rainy day and it really warmed me up. It is a small, cozy space with an assortment of tables and couches inside. The woman who helped me was very kind and the prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the fresh food!For other tourists like me: the front display has the freshly made pastas and there is a chalkboard with the types of sauces you can order, as well as some sandwiches. Fridges have an assortment of drinks and they are self serve. You order at the register and they bring everything out to you. After your meal you pay for everything (foods and drinks). I had a rosemary pasta with bolognese sauce and a Milchkaffe. Very enjoyable meal :)"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/21/17,"Small place in the heart of f'hain. The place itself is not all too romantic, but definitely comfortable and the staff is very friendly! We had one pasta with zucchini and feta which was not amazing (a bit simple) but good anyways, and one aglio olio pasta that was absolutely delicious! Also, the antipasta was tasty. We would definitely go back for a bite again."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/3/16,"I got take away. I ordered gnocchi with tomatoes and black olives. I thought they might have pesto, but they did not at the time I went. So I ended up buying my own jar and adding it because their flavor was bland. The pasta itself was cooked well. Staff was nice and food came out in a timely manner. Personally, do not think it was worth the price though. Easier to make my own."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/24/14,Best homemade pasta plus great sauces and staff. Authentic Italian cuisine and catering. Organic ingredients and fair trade coffee. Thank you Roberto
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/1/14,"A great find.  Delicious food (not Naples, but as good as you will find in Germany), friendly service, and a good vibe.  For visitors, this is walking distance to the Stasi Museum."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,3,7/4/11,"I really like this place, food is great, coffee is good and the people are chill. I'd say stopping by for an espresso is a must, but pasta only if you're not in a hurry and don't mind waiting for 40+ minutes."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/3/10,"Very nice bio / organic pasta for good prices. Also delicious sandwiches (I had one of the best caprese sandwiches ever here - I can still taste it!) and very good coffee! Great for lunch!"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/30/09,"Great pasta to a low price, but the 40 minute wait when I was there takes away a star. Also, no toilets. Update October 2010: This has become one of my regular lunch joints in the last months. The pasta is indeed very good, and we have never needed to wait that long again - food comes within 10 or 15 minutes (but we always go there when it's not crowded). Sometimes I use the wlan."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/3/12,"One of my favorite places for a lunch in Berlin- Fiedrichshain. Very good value for a delicious organic food. (5-8 eur for a dish). Tiny store with a friendly staff, nice ambient and a lots of regulars that keep coming back again and again.. The portions are not to big but full of great taste and after all filling up the stomach. I have never waited more than 15 minuts for a dish. Highly recommended."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/25/08,"A quite small but extremely cosy cafe in Friedrichshain, the runner is the home made (but inexpensive!) pasta of different kinds with herbs and vegetables with 4-5 different sauces. But what you should taste anyway is the vegetable salad - it is a small poem! I don't know how they work this miracleIt's a pity they don't have guests' toilets."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/5/09,"This is a must-go for anyone looking for: 1. great pasta dishes 2. coffee / delicious espresso /etc 3. great ambiance 3. soy milk substitute for lactose products I am impressed by pastapresti with a very clean exterior and interior. At first you think it's just a nice and clean coffee house. The impressive parts comes when you look at the chalk-board menu and see the combination of sauces / vegetable organic/home-made pasta combination that can be ordered. Go for it, sit and relax, enjoy the beautifully simple ambiance and sip on your soy-latte and aubergine/twisty pasta combo. You should go. It's cheap and amazingly delicious."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/30/08,"i was introduced to this little place by an italian friend who works around the corner. quality homemade organic pasta at great prices with a friendly staff. i also had an amazing vegan carrot cake there once. the only downside is that they aren't open very late (20:00), so you'd better make it an early dinner. otherwise, it makes for a great lunch spot."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/20/08,small and cozy bio shop with freshly made pastas & amazing coffee. they also have wines for sale. really nice place to enjoy a pasta and espresso
Belmondo,French,4.5,?21-40,4,8/14/11,"This is a pretty good bistro with great authentic French food, especially their fish soup which is probably the best I have had in Berlin. Note that there is nothing very fancy here as they don't do haute cuisine  just good French country fare.Atmosphere is a little staid, but not unpleasant. There is a good and not too overpriced wine list which includes some pretty decent claret. Service is calm, polite and quite good. You should head here with business partners or friends to sample probably one of the better French country restaurants in Berlin."
Belmondo,French,4.5,?21-40,4,3/17/15,My son and our server held a conversation in French.    Food was very good and the beef tartar had great flavor.  a good place to go in berlin
Ristorante Vero,Italian,4,?11-20,5,1/21/18,Great little Italian place in Koepenick. The food was really good. I've been here twice while on a business trip to Berlin. I highly recommend it. The pasta is always cooked just right.
Ristorante Vero,Italian,4,?11-20,5,3/3/17,Authentic Italian cuisine in a cozy nice setting with friendly professional service and low prices. Definitely worth checking out and we will come back soon.
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/26/16,"Fantastic food with friendly service!Always the spinach and cheese gozleme, but sometimes on a chilly grey day a bowl of many really hits the spot.Love this place!!!"
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/28/17,"Took my partner here after a trip to Istanbul to share manti and g?zleme. Both were excellent, along with the hot yogurt soup. It's a diner-esque atmosphere with yummy affordable food.  And some interesting g?zleme stuffings. Recommended!"
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/20/16,"Fantastic Mantis and G?zleme here. We got the mantis with garlic and it was great. The g?zlme was tasty and freshly made, definitely a comfort food for me. The interior is more like an imbiss so don't expect any service even though the staff is super nice. This is definitely going to be my go to place for my Turkish food from now on."
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/10/16,"Very nice staff, relaxed atmosphere and G?zleme and Manti just like in Turkey! Love this place."
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/6/16,"Me and a turkish foodie-chum went there to have a supper. The unspectacular restaurant was completely empty, so securing a seat seems to be not too difficult there. We were received by two cordially turkish mommies and ordered two helpings of Manti, the traditional turkish dish. They were just preparing the small turnovers fresh in front of our eyes and asked if we want it with garlic and spice topping. I didn't understand any word, because they talked in turkish, but of course we want every topping! Moreover, they always have fresh black turkish tea, which was also ordered by us. After some waiting time, which I ignored because of the absolute freshness of our food and the nearness to the lively Karl-Marx-Stra?e, we received our dishes, served with some bread. The turnovers, filled with minced meat, were whelmed with a load of yoghurt and lots of garlic flavor and paprika powder. I liked the combination and the bread was nearly redundant. For my first time of Manti, i was pretty delighted. For sure I would eat it again. But I heard that there are some places which should be a small pace better, so maybe I'll try it somewhere else next time. But still 4 outta 5!"
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,1/17/16,"Read a review of this restaurant on Still in Berlin. Bold claims were made, claims such as this is one of Berlin's best Mantis. With such high expectations, I was disappointed to say the least. The waitress asked whether we would like garlic in the sauce, we agreed, but the sauce was laced in garlic, guess that's why she asked us. The manti was very one dimensional, by the third spoonful I was bored of it, and eating was just an obligation. Staff were very friendly though!"
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/29/14,Awesome g?zleme. The best i've had so far in Berlin. Even better than those in Moabit (see other review). Prices cheap. Lack of coziness in the interior but that's not too important..
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/6/14,"Looove the G?zleme here.  Haven't found better.  Nice staff and fair prices.  I find the food here different from most other Turkish establishments, and continue to come back for years.  They also do a good Manti with yogurt sauce and sumac.  Haven't had anything bad here."
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/1/14,"I love this place. Their g?zleme is really good, and their prices are very accessible. Every-time I am in Karl Marx Stra?e I try to stop by. My recommendation: a g?zlemer mix of spinach and cheese; potato or the one with edamer k?sse. All this while drinking a glass of turkish tea and watching turkish musicals on tv."
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/18/14,"Holy crap, I love the goezleme at this place. Granted, I had my introduction to them here, and have only had them a few other places. But I seek this restaurant out whenever I'm in Berlin. Lot's of great vegetarian fillings, and you can combine them. Get one with spinach and cheese for a pretty full, delicious, and cheap meal. Or if you're really hungry get one of each. The eggplant filling is great too."
G?zleme Restaurant,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/2/08,"To me, best G?zleme in Berlin. Affordable and good tasting, in a strict neuk?llner style. Relaxed atmosphere, flexible and kind team. Quality is high, prices are low. G?zleme are turkish pastry filled with vegetables, cheese and/or minced meat. Similar to italian piadina, fresh baked if you wish, those specialties are surely worth a try. You might choose the filling as you please. My favourites: lentil soup, hummus and spiced potatoes g?zleme highs: taste, prices, mood, kind ladies cooking with passion lows: probably underestimated"
Brentano,German,4,?11-20,2,1/15/14,"Rien de Fran?ais dans ce restaurant... ? part les prix et peut ?tre aussi le ""Tartare"".D?coration classique avec nappes et serviettes en tissus qui ne pr?sagent en rien une cuisine que nous avons trouv? tr?s moyenne.Les produits sont s?rement frais mais les plats vraiment n'ont rien d'exceptionnel. Par contre addition tr?s sal?e : 110 ? ? quatre avec un plat chacun et les boisson.Nous n'y retournerons pas. Nothing French in this restaurant ... except prices and also may be the ""Tartare"". Classically decorated with tissue tablecloths and napkins but no guarantee for a exeptional food : we found very average. Products were surely fresh but the food really was nothing special. Bill quite expensive: 110 ? for four with one dish each and beveragesNot again."
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/16/14,"Probably the best value for money in terms of fun with your friends! Hundreds if not thousands of games on shelves surrounding us we grabbed a seat and played Smallworld - stayed there for hours and paid the what seems to be a symbolic amount for their time. The keeper was very caring and attentive, went long lengths to help us find what we wanted and knew the shop perfectly (""oh, Smallworld? It's right between the two Zug Zug over there"", it was behind a box - no way he could have seen that!) The place sells light drinks and beer for a decent price, and stays open until you finish your game (as long as you're in your finishing rounds of course!) I would recommend this to anyone playing games from Jenga to Eclipse, it's a lot of fun with any amount and types of friends! Definitely coming back!"
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/11/14,I really love that Berlin has such a thing as a board game salon. The service and board game advice has always been friendly and helpful. The waffles are tasty and the selection of board games is beyond abundant!
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/2/12,"Always fun. Love the grilled sandwiches and the Lammsbr?u, too."
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/13/11,"This has to be my favorite place in all of Berlin! You've got 1200+ board/card games on the shelves that you can take down and play. If you buy a drink or something to eat, then each person can play for just 1,50EUR for the entire day... an incredible bargain! The staff is also always available to help recommend games according to the tastes of your group. I've always had a great experience there. Highly recommended!"
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/15/11,"Great concept! If you've ever spent a rainy day with a good friend hoping your local cafe will have a board game that isn't missing all its pieces, this is the place for you. For only 1.50 more than the price of your drinks, you're free to choose from a huge inventory of games. As an added plus, they're very well-maintained. And the friendly, low-key service deserves a mention - the warm and welcoming environment is a refreshing contrast to the self-consciously hip attitude of nearby cafes and bars. The only downside is that, of course, these games need big tables, and it's a small room...so reservations are actually a good idea. Non-German speakers take note - despite the cafe's website and menu being available in English, virtually all of the games/instructions are in German. I think it's a fun way to practice the language, but it might present a complication for visitors from abroad."
Spielwiese,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/1/13,"Cool place! Lots of games, nice atmosphere, friendly service!"
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,5,7/21/17,"Delicious! Such a treat to have so many vegan sauces to choose from. Get to pick 3 sauces for your falafel, and they are all delicious. Loads of yummy food for a super reasonable price. There is nothing even remotely this fabulous where we live."
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,5,3/22/16,Great vegetarian options! And the vegetables are very fresh too.
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,2,2/29/16,"Good: cheap. Bad: not fresh, too much potatoes inside the sandwich, hot sauce hides any flavour."
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,2,11/10/15,Among the bottom 20% of D?ners I've had. Don't know where the hype comes from.
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,4,3/15/15,"This is my go to d?ner stand. There's always a line it seems, but hey: it's only a small line, and it's well worth the wait. I usually get the chicken Gem?se kebap. They also offer things like falafel durum and their pomes frites are good too. The kebaps are well put together and really tasty, with plenty of potatoes (yum). There are 8 sauces to choose from although I'm rather boring and usually stick with knoblauch and scharf."
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,5,1/21/15,"Best d?ner in this entire city! Lots of veggie options, fresh vegetables, many sauce variations, price more than reasonable, and so friendly guys!"
NUR Gem?se-Kebap,Turkish,4,Under ?10,1,6/1/14,"I think it's fair to say that this was the worst d?ner I ever had. Only very rarely I throw away food but I really couldn't finish this one. I had the vegetarian gem?se d?ner whose primary taste was ""old fat."" The people working there clearly couldn't care less about their customers either. Already too many words for this place. Just don't."
Bertolini,Italian,5,?11-20,5,1/26/17,"Best restaurant in that area. Great Food, nice Staff, very cosy! A recommendation for lunch and Dinner! Love this place! Reservations shall be made."
Bertolini,Italian,5,?11-20,4,8/18/14,"A very good italian deli style restaurant. They have a huge selection of antipasti that you can either have in house or also take away. We went for the the antipasti plate and it really was delicious. I loved their vegetables and the fish selection was very good as well. If you are more into full dishes, they also have a small menu available. Overall a great little find. Will certainly go back there."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,11/11/15,"I took my husband for his birthday to entrec?te & we had a wonderful time there.The waiters were very friendly and the food was delicious and totally worth the price. When we got there we got seated ( which isn't everywhere in Berlin the case), the waiter took our coats and brought the right ones back when we were about to leave and also the wine recommendation to the steak we had was an excellent choice. We really liked the fact that they paid attention to little details i.e. when our glasses were empty they refilled it or after we finished the salad they brought us new forks.We had plenty of bad experiences in Berlin so far, but gladly this wasn't  one of them. :-)"
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,3,11/9/17,"We came here for a networking dinner during a Berlin conference, and it was a great choice. Classic (dim but jovial lighting), professional (waiters in white aproned attire who served almost in sync), classy, and well-insulated so we could have decent conversation.As it was a group dinner, and a set menu, we were limited in choice. Having had my fill of steak and potatoes after a few days in Germany, I went with the vegetarian option: fettucine with mushrooms. I was the only one at my table who chose this option (and it was served well after my fellow conference attendees received their steaks), but it wasn't bad at all. I filched one of my colleague's fries (I can't let a good-looking fry go by), and confirm that it was perfectly cooked. According to him, the steak was also good.The starter salad was yummy but mostly unremarkable (we were served small portions with this set menu), and the caramelized panna cotta dessert was unnecessary."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,5/17/17,"For some odd reason while visiting Germany, I suddenly got a craving for steak...think Le Relais de l'Entrec?te from Paris.  I scoured yelp and lo' and behold, I came upon Entrec?te.  While service is a bit on the slower side, everyone was extremely friendly.  For the food:French onion soup - pretty solid soup.  It wasn't the best that I've had, but it certainly hit the spot and was well made.Sirloin steak with schallot sauce - This dish was decent.  The steak was good quality.  The schallot sauce itself was a bit too tangy for me though.Grilled sliced sirloin with Fred's Herb Sauce - I enjoyed the sauce on this much more.  It is similar to Le Relais so it hit the spot in terms of what I was craving.  It wasn't quite as good as Le Relais, but I wasn't expecting apples to apples.  Finish off your meat and fries and the server will glop you a second serving.  The dish also comes with a side walnut salad.  They dressed it with way too much vinaigrette, so much that it made my gums hurt from all the acid.  Besides the salad, I give Entrec?te 4 stars for a solid experience."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,11/26/17,"The restaurant is not big and tables are a little too close to each other. The service was attentive, but not very friendly, perhaps the main waiter was in a bad mood. The other waiter was much more friendly. Food excellent. I loved my duck confit, an excellent value at $16. The veal was much more expensive, but my friend loved it.Prices in general are on the high side, but worthwhile. I'll go back."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,7/25/15,"We were here for date night. After having known the existence of this restaurant (I work one block away from this restaurant), I only had the idea of trying this out yesterday. After all, Friedrichstrasse is just a stone's throw away, with plenty of touristy restaurants that are not worth writing home about. So I thought that this place would also be the same, lacklustre, bland, and only after one-time visiting tourists. I was proven wrong last night.The reservation system was easy, you can do it in the Internet. So when we showed up at 19:30, we had a table waiting for us, a nice booth, right by the bar. That was a good place to sit.I started with the foie gras terrine, paired with toast. My main course was the steak tartare, mixed right by the table. You can configure your tartare depending on how spicy you wanted it. And since I was looking for some less greasy side dish than chips, I asked for additional toast, which they gave at no charge. Mind you though, the chips were very tasty!The staff was very friendly and helpful. The wine they recommended definitely matched our dishes. I liked the helpful attitude, since we initially suggested a wine, but when we asked if that matches, they recommended a different one, and we were definitely glad we listened. Oh and the dessert. I loved that swimming island with caramel. I ordered that blindly, telling the staff that I don't know what that was, but I wanted it regardless. When it came, the staff asked if he could explain a little about it. I loved the fact that they do care that you know what you're eating. It shows that they are passionate about what they do, and want the diner to enjoy their food. They definitely are not robots simply bringing food from the kitchen.Overall this was a great experience. It's not the most romantic setting, as things are a little too loud for it, and the choice of music also is not romantic. But hey, we weren't looking for that anyway. We were after delicious French food, and this place delivered it, without the stereotypical French attitude, but rather with sincere friendliness and passion for food."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,6/10/17,"This place is right out of Paris - clean and well decorated, very fancy wait staff all speaking French, and a luxurious menu. But the name is Entrec?te and this is what you should order - the 'menu classic' is absolutely delicious and exactly what a traditional entrec?te should be. For Berlin a little pricey but for Mitte it's really ok."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,6/18/15,"Was really great, the service was friendly, we ordered beer, they not have many options, but it's ok and Campari with orange juice, they said, do you want something special? I said, just Campari with orange juice, again something special, ok, special hahaha, with orange juice :P After we sat down at the table, I ordered steak salmon with stick fries and salad, was really really god, for drink just water. When finish we saw the menu of dessert and ordered tarte au citron and creme brulee, uuuhhmmm magnifique We recommend this place, isn't cheap, but have good service and good food :)"
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,2,9/4/16,"I very much wanted to like this place. The wait staff are French and kind and the dishes and wine are authentic, but every dish missed. At these prices, the chef and staff should be fired:- The green salad was DRENCHED in dressing. It's a solid French mustard dressing, but the lettuce was swimming. Clearly a German on the garde a manger station.- Onion soup came with no fewer than 7 pieces of baguette under the layer of cheese (hope you'll still be hungry for the rest of your meal!) and did not have any beef in the broth (broth was yellow/clear instead of brown/red). Flavor and richness were lacking.- The frites are matchstick, which can be amazing, but mine were too thin, and so overdone. I saw others that looked slightly thicker and perfectly crisp, so it was probably just my misfortune. Had this been the only miss, I would not have mentioned it.- The duck confit arrives on top of a bed of sauerkraut, which seems to be a concession to local German tastes. It didn't complement the duck much in my opinion, and the duck was otherwise very good.- The chocolate mousse was extremely bitter (raw cacao?) and the Chantilly was dispensed from a store-bought can: limp and flavorless. For the price and aspiration of this establishment, I expect freshly whipped cream. C'mon, it's the easiest thing in the world to make and unforgivable for a French restaurant charging these prices.- Service was overall decent for Germany. They're popular on Sunday's because they're one of the only games in town that is open. They were also dealing with several large groups with the IFA convention in town, so tip o' the hat for that.Finally, it's LOUD in this shotgun with right angles everywhere, hard surfaces, mirrors, and zero sound baffling."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,2/14/16,Wow. Beyond our expectations.  We are still eating the meal and I had to post.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  Great menu. A little expensive but well worth it. The steak tartar is the best in Berlin. My wife says so and she is a steak tartar aficionado.
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,11/1/16,"Oh how i miss Good Service in Berlin! ..Luckily this place is a rare example of good service. Eve-ry-thing was absolument charmant! Good food (the name suggests they are stronger in meats than in seafood so don't expect the lobster to be the same as the one you had last year in Brisbane), good selection of wines, relaxed atmosphere and ahhhh the staff! Service was super nice and unobtrusive. Please let Berlin have more places like this. Merci beaucoup et a bien tot! ps: 4 stars cause there's always room for improvement ;)"
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,7/13/15,"This is a good place to eat and meet people!Fish soup with baguette, water and Riesling wine to begin with. Good service here. Salmon steak was fairly good and so was the vanilla ice cream afterwards. Now I sit with a Very good coffee and a glass of brandy :-)"
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,8/1/16,"Good service, good food and a nice wine list. The chocolate fondant and the meat dishes are great. Worth going!"
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,11/23/14,"This is a really cozy French restaurant near to all the tourist attractions. Still, there are any locals here as the service is perfect and their food and wine collection is on a very high level. Be sure to make a reservation."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,6/29/16,"Really great service here.  Or maybe I'm getting so used to ""Berlin, worst restaurant service city on the planet"" that I'm easily impressed.  But even comparing it to places in Paris, the service here was really good.  I've been horrifically spoiled by steaks in New York, Texas, Tokyo, Portland and Los Angeles and the menu was mostly steak options as I recall, at least that's what I had.  Certainly not the best in the world or anything, but it was very good.  The experience was well worth the money, and the fabulous service was a joy."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,7/1/15,Overall it's good. I don't think u can miss with anything on the menu. its not the best example of any of the dishes iv ever had but its also not bad. If your in Berlin and want a taste of Paris i would say go here its as close as your gonna get without heading to France.
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,7/18/15,"My family and I did a trip to Europe this summer and went to many great restaurants. Entrec?te was one of my favorites. We started with the oyster which we're impeccable, then we got the escargot which were very good. For my entree, I got the Steak tartare which might be the best steak tartare I've ever had. Then I finished with an unbelievable creme br?l?e. In my opinion, a must-go in Berlin. It was so good we went twice in the three nights we spent in Berlin."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,10/22/15,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed dining there this evening.  We had lamb chops and beef stroganoff, both dishes were excellent.  Great atmosphere and an easy walk from our hotel.  With drinks and two side dishes the bill was only 67 euro, good value."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,4,5/4/11,"Fresh food, simple preparation, nice atmosphere, fantastic service. We had a large group for dinner at Entrec?te and I wasn't sure they could pull this off, but they did. We weren't rushed and weren't abandoned. A variety of starters, all well prepared and delicious. The favorite was a frizzee and endive salad with beautiful lemon vinaigrette and baked chevre. The vinaigrette was superb and the chevre added an earthy layer of flavor and texture. Similarly, a variety of main's but tonight's highlight was asparagus with X, where X could be beef, salmon, pork or wiener schnitzel. Classic preparation with fresh local ingredients. It's spargle season in Germany and this dish was wonderful - Warm, perfectly cooked and served with butter or hollandaise. I had the schnitzel, excellent; served with lemon and capers, a nice acidic counterpoint to the veal. At the end, An excellent dessert selection and a delightful offering of cheese. The only drawback was the location of our table. Right next to the front door, kind of out of the way and didn't allow you to take in the ambiance of restaurant. But I'll be back. This was delightful."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,1,5/7/14,"We were hungry after a long day of sightseeing. Looked to Yelp to help us find a good restaurant. Excited to try this restaurant. Although restaurant only appeared half full, we were told they were full. Wouldn't sets us at empty bar or at near empty outside table."
Entrec?te,French,4,?21-40,5,9/16/10,"After having waited in line at the Reichstag for several hours, I was more than ready for lunch. I found Entrecote in the Michelin Red guide, and it lived up to my expectations. The menu was extensive enough to satisfy every member of my sometimes picky group.  I hate to admit that I loved their perfectly frit pommes frites. The sidewalk tables were popular, and we were fortunate to get the last one.  Although upon taking a trip inside, I found that the interior tables would have been great too.  The service was attentive. No complaints here."
Carlos,Tapas Bars,4,Under ?10,3,11/3/10,"OK: So yeah, they have coffee and tea and other stuff... I'm sure its great...BUT ....................They have fresh home made EMPANADAS.....!!!I just consumed two wonderful beef filled (with a touch of olives) golden brown delicious empanadas. Oh yes, I will be back for more of these 2euro nummy noms."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,9/2/16,"An excellent Spanish small-plate restaurant that has it all: great food and wine selection, friendly staff, and lovely design with lots of outdoor seating when the weather is warm enough. The location is really nice, too, as its right across the street from G?rlitzer Park in the heart of Kreuzberg's Wrangelkiez. The extensive menu features lots of traditional tapas as well as more creative ideas. Highlights include baked goat cheese with rosemary and strawberry marmalade, fried eggplant drizzled with honey, and the patatas bravas (fried potatoes). It's not cheap, but won't break the bank and is really worth every penny. I highly recommend this place to both locals and visitors. We take all of our friends here when they come to visit and nobody has ever complained."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,1,8/9/17,Very unfriendly new boss from Argentina.Very bad atmosphere there. Nothing looks purty.
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,3/19/16,"Bar Raval is all about the tapas, but the one time I was there, the wine was actually the best thing. That's because the wine was amazing, not because the tapas was lacking. We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, much more than we could possibly eat and felt extravagant for an evening. Only downside: the lighting is way too bright. So don't go if you want to impress someone with your lovely face because this light ain't doing you any favors."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,3/2/15,"On my second trip to Berlin, I visited Bar Raval because I remembered having a great experience there almost two years earlier. The quality of the food and service hasn't changed. I loved the chorizo in cider and the eggplant tempura with honey, and the chocolate mi-cuit was well worth the wait (which can be up to twenty minutes, but that would be the case at any restaurant). The wait staff are friendly and generous, doling out smiles and travel tips, and pouring a generous glass of wine to make up for a small misstep. Kreuzberg is a vibrant neighbourhood and this place is definitely a solid bet."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,7/25/15,"Tataki de press iberica- pork is soooooo tender! Strongly recommend! Sweet potato is nice, good prawns and fried cuttlefish! But sweet wine is just okay, a bit like syrup:p price is a bit costly cuz the portion is quite small, nice atmosphere and stuff!"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,7/24/15,"I went here with two friends, the tapas were good, we were hungry so we ordered garlic prawn, boiled octopus, fried cuttlefish, eggplant tempura, potato omelette, and bread with tomato..  and the seafood were really good, especially the prawns!!"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,11/8/13,"Great Tapas with an innovative approach. My highlights were the Tataki de press iberica - pork (beautifully cooked), Goat cheese gratin with honey and a marmalade of tomato and herbs, Eggplant tempura with honey and the Tortilla de patatas"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,2/2/16,The best Tapas in Berlin.Food is always fresh and tastes wonderful.Most Tapas restaurants in Berlin do not serve fresh food or seafood.This one has lot of options and the staff are friendly.
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,8/23/15,"The food was incredible, the service was incredible, and I would absolutely eat here again.  Everyone should visit when they are in Berlin and especially when they want a break from typical German food.  Get anything off the favorites menu and you will not be disappointed!!!!"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,8/2/12,"My favorite Tapas place in Berlin.Food is totally yummy here, especially the octopus and squids.I have absolutely no complains about the place.Gives a very tapas bar feel with wooden tables and chairs.The place stays empty early evenings but one can almost never find a place a little later in the evening, when the real Spanish come in for dinner.Good for friends to hang out or a chilled out date."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,9/20/15,"croquettes, jamon serrano, chorizo, cheese dish, tomato dish ... all fantastic"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,3,5/16/12,"Though Bar Raval didn't blow us away, it was a nice spot with good food. It has a very simple but well put together atmosphere. The prices were good and the wine selection was pretty decent. Worth going to if you are staying in the neighborhood, but not sure I would go out of my way to go there."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,10/6/12,"Very nice Spanish tapas restaurant in Kreuzberg.  Easy to find, with good service (for Berlin, anyway).  Tapas is mostly spot on.  We ordered one of the more inexpensive bottles of wine on the menu, but the quality was still top-notch.  We tried about 7 dishes, plus dessert.  No duds, but the salad and goat cheese were nothing special, so a disappointment given the price.  Some of the other dishes, while tasty on their own, are unfortunately served just as is, no dressings, garnishes or pairings, as I've seen at higher-end tapas restaurants in other countries.  It's a shame, as it would be a great chance for a chef to add some creativity to a standard croquette or fried calamari plate.  Other dishes were rounded out better, including a delicious rabbit.  The star of the night though was the dessert, a deeply dark-chocolatey souffle with  in-house made ice cream.  The waitress, perhaps aware of our American sensibilities, even came by to apologize for the extra time the kitchen needed to prepare the dish, but the wait was worth it."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,6/16/12,"We like it, always great service and tasty munchies! Busy sometimes, but atmosphere counts , no?!"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,3,3/24/11,"Lovely atmosphere, full house but the service was so friendly and found us a table as quickly as they could. Not always what you find in Kreuzberg, where 'non-locals' are often treated with disdain, so this was a refreshing change. The beer was great, an amazing one from around the corner in Neuk?lln which is worth trying. The food was....OK...but nothing really made us leap out of our chairs with excitement. The patatas bravas could have been softer and crunchier on the outside, the gambas con ajillo were a real lowpoint: pale and anaemic and the garlic oil didn't pack a punch. All in all it was a nice evening mainly thanks to the service and atmosphere (and each other's company) but the food was a disappointment, which I hate to say."
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,2/21/11,"Leckere , wirklich authentische spanische K?che . Die Einrichtung ist retro ,aber zeitlos und wenn voll sehr gem?tlich . Der Service hat noch Verbesserungspotential, ist aber freundlich. Wenn du in Kreuzberg bist und Tapas magst ein MUSS !"
Bar Raval,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,8/26/12,"As spaniard I have to say that after 3 years in Berlin Ive finally found real spanish tapas that taste like in Spain! We were told that the paellas are made by a real valenciano and you can totally feel it in the taste. The waiters are friendly, even if the bar is sometimes too full (in summer it is difficult to get a table outside but they always managed to give us one a.s.a.p). Last time we were there the food took a bit long, but they told us in advance and gave us some extra olives and allioli (garlic mayonaise), they were making this to every table around us so the wait wasnt that horrible. Timbal de escalibada, chocos, pan amb tomaquet, pulpo a la gallega, ensaladilla rusa, croquetas, albondigas, tataki, pimientos de padron I could recommend every tapa of the menu. And for dessert, my favourite: Flan, the best flan I ate in years! I can totally understand why it is always so full. Congrats!"
D?nette,French,4.5,,5,1/6/17,"Super cosy little pearl with really nice food and very friendly staff in the middle of this cute but quite unknown area.They only opened 4 months ago and the place is already full. No wonder since the food tasted really really good. We stopped in here for lunch and tried their Blumenkohl-Creme soup (5.5?) and Risotto with broccoli and curry Creme (10?).Both dishes were served as generous portions and tasted amazing. Drink-wise we tried their home made lemonade with apple/rosemary/fig (2?), and one with cucumber/mint/apple (3.5?). DELICIOUS Will definitely be coming back here often!Pssst. Every second Sunday they also serve brunch"
D?nette,French,4.5,,4,10/4/17,"I don't find myself on this area of Berlin too often, but a company event was nearby and so we went here for lunch. We made a reservation, given the fact that we were a large group. Service was prompt and friendly, and even though there was a slight delay for our food to arrive (which can be attributed to the large size of our group), we nevertheless were very pleased with our meal.I liked the various teas they offer, I thought the flavor combinations were very interesting and definitely worth a try. During that time, we tried one of the items in their lunch menu, and I took the corn-fed chicken paired with a salad and fries. I must say that the fries I had were one of the best fries I've had in a while. The chicken was slightly dry, but nevertheless it was tasty and above average in quality.Again, I don't frequent this part of town, but if ever I am in the area again and need lunch, I will try to come back."
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/6/14,Amazing Hallumi and kaziki sandwiches. All very tasty and fresh. You can't go wrong in Izmir's.
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/17/16,"So if you are around Kotti, and you don't want to eat another donner go konak grill! You will find a selection of kofte and the great kofte sandwich really famous in ismir. The meat is great and the combination of the vegetables inside the sandwich makes it a very good choice of you are hungry around midnight :)"
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/25/16,"Good kofte, decent portion for the price, meatballs are very tasty and juicy, and gemuse has a picant touch. Also, pay attention to the tasty hot sauce, yummy."
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/27/15,"This place was great for a quick meal before a night out around Kottbusser Tor. The sis kofte (skewered meatball strips) and crusty bread were excellent, as were the big plates of fresh salad. Atmosphere was loud and crowded on a Friday night with fast counter service.When trying to find the place, note that the main sign out front says Izmir Koftecisi."
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/28/14,"If you are hungy around the ""Kotti"" area, you will find the food yummy....but in comparison to the other cool grill shops in the area, it is average....if not below.....And the prices are not fair either. Good thing to mention here: the staff is really friendly and quick."
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/27/11,Great place for kofte! fresh and delicious turkish food other than the infamous  doner
Konak Grill,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/11/12,best k?fte in kreuzberg!!! my friends in the USA dream of it fondly. i've eaten two in one sitting before. amazing and open late.
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,1/18/18,"I arrived before they were even open and there was already a line. Luckily, I was a party of one, so I was seated right away. The place is small, and cash only, but WOW was that some good ramen. I had the Wonton Ramen and I have to say, between the wontons, buttery shio brother, and veggies, this may have been the best ramen I've ever had, and I'm a ramen snob from Los Angeles. Yum! Perfect for the snowy day."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,12/25/17,"This is probably the best ramen place in Berlin. During 4 months of my stay in Berlin, I couldn't find any ramen place that would top this or any good ramen place in Berlin in general. Of course you had to line up for it. My coworkers and I went there early, before it opened and there were already people in line. Luckily we got a spot even though there were 6 of us. This is one of the places where you have to line up but it's not hyped up. I had the tonkastu ramen. All the ingredients in the ramen are pretty high quality, the pork, the seaweed, the ginger etc. I'm not sure if it was because I haven't had good ramen for so long or maybe it's actually that amazing but best ramen ever! Please keep it up!"
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,1/17/18,"Been going there for years. They continue to impress with japanese impeccable ramen kitchen. Sadly they are closed now on sundays, so I'll have to seek out other options."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,7/15/16,"I was actually very impressed and surprised by this place.  I wasn't expecting much being from this place since it is in Berlin but this place is actually one of the better ramen places I've been to (and we have some pretty good options in NYC/Boston.)  Mostly though I was impressed that they actually hired people who are able to speak Japanese (which seems like a rarity these days...)  It was a good experience also because we were seated at the ramen bar so we got to watch the chefs cook everyone's food.We ordered the Tonkotsu and the Shoyu.  The Tonkotsu soup base was delicious and the pork belly in it was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth!  The Shoyu was also SO GOOD. For our appetizer we also got the Moyatan (because they sadly ran out of the kakuni...) which was not for me, but it was still pretty good. I highly recommend you come here if you haven't had legit ramen before!"
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,10/22/17,The place brought me back to Tokyo! Didn't think I would get to taste authentic Japanese ramen in Berlin. I was taken by surprise! The place is tiny yet cozy. The staff were friendly and helpful. The home-made lemonade was refreshing and the wanton plate was just what you need on a cold wet day. The ramen I had was called Shachu Ramen which was with slices of pork. It blew my mind away :) I like this place more than the other branch :)
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,9/19/16,"I feel like the sign that a restaurant of  [insert ethnicity] is delicious and the real deal is if the majority of patrons of X ethnicity eat there, and if the chefs are of X ethnicity. Well, if that is an indication, this place is packed to the brim with Japanese clientele, and the chefs, one of which is kinda hot, are all Japanese. I was right - the food is delicious (especially when you add the condiments) , the price is right, and the experience is authentic. Yayyyyyy! Hipsters rejoice! The ambience feels like you're in a smoky, cozy Japanese street eatery in a 1940s traditional Japan meets 2016 teak wood Japanese modern age sort of way. Each bowl hovers around 8-10 euro so hooray, that means you can eat at least two and still be a cheapskate! There's outdoor seating in the back, and a beautiful interior, in a fun neighborhood. You really can't go wrong. So good I definitely ordered and ate two bowls of Shio in one sitting lol.                              ~~~ THOSE WITH GLUTEN ALLERGIES, REJOICE!! ~~~What's even better than the awesome food, is the service. I was SO excited to try their food that I stupidly forgot that ramen noodles are made of wheat, and helllllllo I am actually allergic to wheat. I was literally crushed when I realized this, especially because WE WERE SITTING AT THE TABLE WHEN I DID. SMH. I went all the way there, 25 minutes via train, walked 10 more minutes, waited 10 more minutes for a table, waited 10 more minutes for the waitress to come AND THEN THE REALIZATION HIT ME. Dude. Re-freaking-diculous. I'm SMH @ my damn self. When you think you've finally found something which checks off for being free of all 9,367 things you're allergic to, it's like all brain function stops! Anyway, upon telling her of my allergy, the waitress kindly asked the chefs if they had any rice noodles on hand (without my knowledge!), and came back to report they could make Shio specifically for me, WITH GLUTEN FREE RICE NOODLES!! #YASSSSSGAWDDDDDDD  And when I tell you that this ramen was banging, was the bees knees, was all that and a bag of chips, I mean it! Being the greedy heathen I am, I ordered 2 bowls of Shio. Was totes worth it. YAYYYYYYYY. I will legit always come back here, for that alone."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,2,4/24/17,"Ramen was delicious and excellent except waitress messed up the orders and gave me the guys order. I left $$ under my bowl and told a waitress and then all of a sudden I was being pulled by my backpack for the money. Fuck you lady. Like I'm gonna stiff you for $10.Line was out the door."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,5/13/17,"This is the most delicious ramen I've ever eaten! Beats all others, including places I've tried in Japan! The tonkotsu ramen is a must. Creamy, savory pork broth, perfect noodles, tender slices of pork and a chunk of pork belly, topped with slices of ginger and ground toasted sesame seeds. So good!"
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,4,7/10/16,"I ate here along with a couple of friends the first night we were in Berlin as I was intrigued by the number of Asian restaurants around. And to be honest, I was really missing Asian food...Walking in, you can only see the indoor seating so the restaurant appears to be quite small. We waited a little over 10 minutes near the doorway before we were seated, and were led to a table outside behind the restaurant. I ordered a rice tea and a tonkotsu ramen. The broth was pretty good--on the lighter side for a tonkotsu. The noodles were ok, but at least was still chewy. The tonkotsu was the only ramen with a soft boiled egg, which was marinated well but slightly too salty. It also had two different types of meat in the bowl: one fattier, more marinated piece of pork and the rest thin slices that is the standard for ramen.The pricing is pretty standard as well: ?12 for both the tea and ramen. Overall, it's a pretty safe choice for authentic ramen in Berlin and I would definitely say to give it a try if you're in the area."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,3,6/23/16,"Been here a couple of times probably due to my high expectations (reviews and ambiance) I've been somewhat disappointed. I really enjoyed the lemon ginger tea but thought the miso ramen was too salty. Everyone's salt tolerance is different so try it yourself. It's the vegetarian option so maybe they feel they have to overcompensate...The place is tiny so be prepared to wait but the ambiance is fantastic. You feel like you're stepping into Japanese kitchen. You can sit at the bar facing the chefs as they ladle soup into rustic clay bowls and hang wooden and wire utensils on the wall. There are tables for small parties in the back or more space outside if the weather's nice. I love the pictures of the 5 or so different ramen dishes hanging on the wall in the entrance. The portions are generous and warming. Have some Japanese beer or a rice tea if you're in for something different. Enjoy!"
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,4,1/18/17,"First time at Cocolo!  The wait was long to get in, it was very busy even for a weeknight.  We ended up sitting at a table with another group.  The food was pretty good.  Service was nice.  Interior was neat but very loud. Would go back next time i'm in town."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,7/9/16,"My fiance and I are huge ramen fans (having gone to Japan several times and coming from SF Bay Area where the ramen culture is in full swing). We decided that on our Europe trip, we'll try to visit at least one ramen store in each city. Cocolo was a couple of blocks from where we were staying, so we dropped by after arriving in Berlin. It's a small ramen joint that gives an authentic Japanese ramen parlor feel. We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen. It was really delicious and we cleaned bowls! It may not be the best ramen we've ever eaten, but it's definitely comparable to some of the best ramen we have in San Francisco Bay Area."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,4,5/25/16,"It's really real Ramen. Yes, in Berlin. And there are Asian people in the kitchen so it's super legit. My friend was saying that it's a bit pricey for the Ramen, but he didn't realize the amount of money I would pay for a decent bowl. So I was ready for my wallet to hurt, but he totally lied to me. I got the the Tonkotsu Ramen with tender pork belly, a perfect soft boiled egg, ginger, and seaweed 9,50. We had sides and drinks as well and it was hella good and all for 40. Love this place and if I lived in Berlin, I'd be a frequent customer."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,7/4/17,"Although I am not a big ramen fan, my son and daughter rave about the Raman here at Cocolo! As a vegetarian, I was happy to be able to find a meat-free option as well : ) the staff was friendly and efficient."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,8/9/17,"This place had some of the best ramen. Also, the pork belly was the perfect combination of crispy and soft."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,4,8/5/17,We ordered the vegetarian ramen (Miso) and the pork ramen (Shoyu). The ramen was a bit salty for us but still quite delicious. We love the way the egg was cooked in the Miso ramen and the vegetarian broth was delicious!
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,3,3/21/17,"We arrived at around 6:30 on a Thursday night and ended up waiting around thirty minutes to be seated. I expected lots of great things from the reviews, but my miso ramen ended up being a little on the salty side. The calpico soda was delicious, though!"
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,11/19/16,"It's always a perfect day for a bowl of ramen!Tip: it's next door to a sushi restaurant, so don't walk into the wrong one!The space is a bit small, but it's nice and cozy. Probably able to fit around 30 people at a time.Within 3 minutes of you sitting down, you'll be eating that bowl of ramen.Very fast service and quick turnaround.Be warned, this place is cash only!The ramen is definitely worth the walk."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,5,9/9/16,"What gets me about this place is that they do have outdoor seating out back in the summer, but it's tucked in a hole in the wall, and a bar area where you can sit and watch the chefs make ramen. The ramen tastes really great, and they only have like 5-6 kinds of ramen you can choose one, so it's very simple and a great ramen bar to experience while you're in Berlin. Their broth tastes amazing and their ramen noodles are cooked to perfection."
Cocolo Ramen,Ramen,4,?11-20,4,12/30/15,"Have had ramen in nyc and Tokyo, and this place is legit. Not saying it's better, but it's as good. And for it to be that good in Germany, that's pretty cool.Place has limited sitting, and it's pretty popular so had to wait a bit. But not too long. Flavorful broth, noodles got a good bite, and meats are tasty. I would come back again if I was craving ramen in Berlin."
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/6/17,Incredibly authentic with heaping portion sizes at a fantastic price. Just brush up on your Deutsch beforehand!
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/1/16,"I got take-out from here, and was given a very sizeable portion (for 2) of meat, rice, bread, and salad. It was flavorful, and my favorite part was the spicy sauce mixed with the yogurt sauce. No menu in English, but you can see in the counter everything that is available, so you can ask them to cook what you see on the grill. Very fresh. Paid around 14 euro for the meal."
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/28/15,"I added so many pictures I had to write a review - finally, so...Short story: it's officially a best grill in town: best dorado, best prawns, best meat. Every dish is served with a generous portion of a fresh salad and hot bread. They have three types of soups: all of them taste very delicious. Beside all that they serve hot dishes, which vary from day to day, so menu is never the same. Great place! You can order every meat type as ""a meat in bread"" and it tastes so good! Eating here for 12 years. Never had a bad day there :-)Long story: I know everybody in here, because I'm going here for 12 years already. It's such a delicious grill place, I can't help it. I know it doesn't look very inviting from the outside, but you won't regret you stepped in once you've tasted their food.Grilled dorado - is the most popular dish in here. Fish is always fresh and tastes like heaven: soft and tender, crispy on the outside, served with arugula and lemon. Best fish I ever tasted!Meat variety is huge. You can order chicken, lamb, ribs, even leaver etc. All the meat is also grilled, served with rice and portion of salad as any other dish. Portions are really great. By the way, salad is incredible! I always wonder how they manage to get these sweet tomatoes every single time?Prawns. Well, that's a little secret, actually. They don't always show it on the display, so if you want to get a taste of those delicious prawns, you have to ask for them. They are grilled with a pinch of salt and served with arugula and a portion of salad - just as fish. I can only recommend those. When I was eating them, I imagined myself in Barcelona, in one of those amazing restaurants along the coast. But this is a different story :-)Resume: come inside, make yourself comfortable, order whenever your heart wishes for and enjoy these flavorful taste. You'll never regret you talked yourself into going here :-)"
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/25/14,"Get my own beer? The cheek!It's bleak outside (the exterior, not the weather), but somehow Pascha attracts a crowd. I wonder why? The charcoal grill meat and fish of course! It's cafe-esque inside and you get your own beer (?2.50) from the fridge, open it yourself and wave it to them while ordering self service style.We opted for charcoal grilled whole Dorado (?10.50), Sea bass (?10.50) and lamb cutlets (?11.50) with rice. All dishes come with a salad and basket of Turkish bread. And I have to say, it's the tastiest fish I've tasted that isn't battered!! The cutlets were equally melt in mouth, absolutely fantastic and came with a slightly creamed rice.The guys behind the counter are pretty jolly too and are constantly topping up your bread basket and tea (?1.20). When they get a chance a melamine tabletop wipe-down is in order to accommodate the queue of customers knocking at their door. Do yourself a favour, step outside the touristy areas and explore :)"
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/26/15,"Delicious food (highly recommend the grilled fish) and terrific customer service. Not to mention, reasonable prices."
Pascha Grill 5,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/4/14,"Don't be fooled by the drab facade, this place serves up real authentic and cheap Turkish grill dishes. The Adana d?r?m is the best in town, and only ?3.50! Scharf and knoblauch sauces are made from scratch and are delicious. Same goes for the salad, which they're constantly preparing fresh and provide generous amounts of."

Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,5/13/17,"Mama, I've done it.  I think I have managed to find the most satisfying avocado toast in Berlin.I have been on the quest for the 'best' avocado toast for quite some time now, and I already know what you're thinking.  How could there possibly be such varying degrees of greatness when it comes to avocado toast?  The dish is literally as straight-forward as a dish could possibly get.  Find yourself a slice of great toast and a generous helping of avo, and you're pretty much set, right?  Right--it's not rocket science.  For most dishes, good and satisfying generally go hand-in-hand.  In fact, for most dishes the two adjectives are relatively interchangeable.  But, avocado toast makes for quite the exception.  Because of the simplicity of the dish, good does not necessarily constitute satisfying.  By satisfying, I'm talking bang for your buck.  Don't get me wrong here.  I'm usually a quality-over-quantity type of girl, but when you can get both quality and quantity?  Table for one please.The portion sizes here (in terms of the avo toast) are what hangry dreams are made of.  For 8.50, you can expect two generous slices of bread (I want to say it was sourdough, but that may just be wishful thinking...) loaded with globs of smashed avocado (they really don't hold themselves back here) under a bed of dressed arugula, sliced radishes, and pickled red onions.  It's all in the details people!  The pickled onions added the perfect amount of sweetness and bite to an already perfect combination of flavors.Avocado toast is in and of itself brunch at its absolute best.  With the amount of options you have scattered about the city, it is really difficult to go wrong.  For the most satisfying, however, I have yet to find a little spot that trumps Les Papilles in terms of bang-for-your-buck.  Whoever said you can't put a price on happiness was definitely wrong.  You can--and it definitely does not need to be a hefty one."
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,2,11/14/17,"Really? #19 out of 7,003 restaurants in Berlin on Tripadvisor? #2 out of 1,178 restaurants for breakfast?? Either Tripadvisor is rigged or if not, I am really questioning the reliability of the patrons reviewing the place. Unfortunately, this is becoming a pattern for us here in Berlin. Overrated hipster restaurants. We traveled a bit out of the way to try the place because of the high ranking on Tripadvisor. We got there and the one person working there seemed harried, trying to handle the walk-ins for takeaway as well as the table service. The wait to get our order in was long. Too long, I would say, for how (un)busy it was. In regards to the food, it was average. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict with bacon, and he said that it was one of his least favorites. It didn't have much sauce and it was dry. I had the mushroom on rye with a soft boiled egg, which was tasty but not very nicely presented. Kind of a mess on the plate. The wi-fi doesn't really work.That's all I have to say about the breakfast. Average food in an average place. Not worth traveling out of your way to eat here."
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,7/11/17,My continuing global search for the world's best eggs benedict led me to this quaint little cafe in Berlin. The French owners managed to deliver one of the best renditions of this classic dish that I have ever had to date.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the eggs were perfectly poached laying on a bed of delicious smoky bacon. I will be back! Highly recommended.
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,10/31/16,"Great food, cute ambience, and very affordable prices! I met a friend here for coffee and a light lunch. I had a cappuccino and eggs benedict, and she had the French Toast. My total was 8.50 and hers was just 5! Their brunch menu is great, and it looks like they serve brunch until their midday closing at 3. Would definitely recommend!"
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/16,"Super sch?nes Restaurant. Habe sch?ne Abend mit meine Freundin da genie?en. Mein Kommentar wird f?r die Lammrippen!"
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,6/13/16,Very nice atmosphere. Nice to sit outside. Friendly employees. Ordered a brunch menu. All the food was really good just the salad I found a bit boring.
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,6/23/16,"Food's great, service is great...can't really tell you anything more than you'll read on every other comment.  You should definitely come here."
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,10/26/15,"Very nice and cosy place! We had breakfast: both the homemade granola and the french toast were yummy, chai latte was excellent too!Cheap prices!We didn't have the brunch but it looked very good: one hot beverage, one juice, homemade bread and cheese, granola, hot meal and croissant for only 10 euros!Waiters were very friendly!"
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,10/25/15,"Such a fantastic spot! The vibe, the hip-hop background music, the ambiance...and the FOOD. I had their infamous cheeseburger and was not disappointed. I also had a starter plate with 4 French cheeses that was fantastic. But, all this aside, the staff is really what makes this place superb. They are attentive, engaging, and very friendly. Customer service is huge for me and this restaurant gets 5/5, hands down. Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in Berlin."
Les Papilles,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,6/7/15,"This Cafe has recently opened on flughafenst. (im sorry i guessed when it opened if someone else knows the exact info and would like to update it). The cafe has a very friendly french owner and the baked items were all fresh, homemade and most importantly very delicious, and the owner steve really goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need and are satisfied with your experience. We had vegetarian eggs benedict, it was very good. The coffee was very nice and the space was comfortable. Every aspect of this cafe shows the great care and passion the owner has in provinding a good experience for every single customer. We are looking forward to going back."
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,6/3/17,"Great service & amazing foodWe, 3 persons, ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta. It was enough to feed cows!!! Tastes really good as well!!!"
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,9/25/16,"This is the real Italian style! Family run business, here since the ~80s.Don't go anywhere else in Berlin: the best pizza is here. Huge sizes and fair price. Still quality is high! The pizza style is flat and crunchy, super easy to digest. As dessert, you should go for PannaCotta: despite the classic, it s not what you might have tried in other places. Tried to sneak out the recipe to the owner and waitress but that s a secret!"
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,4/27/12,"Went here with a friend and we each ordered a pizza, thinking they were personal-sized. The pizzas are actually quite huge and both barely fit on the table. The pizzas were delicious and very much like the kind I've had in Italy with a thin, chewy crust. The waiter was very friendly and brought us complimentary olives before the meal. The place is kind of small, but there's good seating outside."
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,3,2/9/10,"I tried this trattoria/pizzeria tonight as another restaurant I wanted to go to was shut. I ordered a Pizza dello Chef (pizza with prosciutto, ruccula and parmigiano). It was a very large sized pizza baked in a brick oven. I thought the prosciutto was sliced too thickly to be easily edible. I also thought the crust could have been a bit thinner as well."
Bar Restaurante Faro,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,12/6/16,"Had two great experiences here...the first time for normal dinner (great service, fast & delicious food) and the second was planned ahead with the owner- we celebrated our wedding with 20 people here. Food was amazing and service was perfect- friendly and efficient!"
Bar Restaurante Faro,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,11/21/17,"This kind of place that instantly gives you good vibes. Chill atmosphere and candle's lights. I have to critique Spanish food as a true Spaniard, but it was quite acceptable. The beer was good price, and drinking Estrella Galicia always means happiness."
Bar Restaurante Faro,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,2,9/17/17,The food was ok but it took one hour to prepare a single tapas and a salad.  I won't be going back.

Bar Restaurante Faro,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,4/6/14,Small but excellent Spanish restaurant. Very authentic atmosphere since the cooks and waiters as well as many of the guests are from Spain (now living in Berlin). They serve mostly home made tapas but also other varieties of Spanish Food. One should definitely try the pulpo and the berenjenas fritas (fried egg plants) which are outstanding.
Tadim Ocakba??,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,2/28/15,"Not a typical restaurant, more like a bistro. Never the less, the food was a beautiful experience! Very friendly and quick service, a good and limited selection of dishes and drinks, and very authentic in taste and interior. The food was perfectly seasoned and well made, it was colorfull and also presented well.I'll be back!!"
Tadim Ocakba??,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,6/7/15,"One of the best Turkish food I have had outside of Turkey! Always fresh and great produce, meat grilled to order. Super nice staff as well. So all in all, always a pleasure."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,5,3/9/16,"Come back again for the second time. Amazing as always1) amuse is the fermented papaya with peanut emulsion in peanut shape2) char with leek foam and quinoa 3) chili con carne of lamb ... Not gamey at all and the crunch on top was perfect4) granny smith apple. The apple sorbet was amazing in a chocolate shell and the mouse of the twig shape is chocolate and apple sauce and the chocolate icecream with caramel :)And petit four Amazing again :) service is great as wellOne of my friends also has a gluten allergy and they were very accommodating. She says the Gluten free bread was one of the best she has ever had :)"
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,5,12/29/16,"Great restaurant with an amazing lunch menu option. The restaurant itself is very nice, it is embedded in a small garden on top of a building. The service is as expected in a 2 star restaurant. Very professional and attentive. The food is really great. I especially liked the octopus grilled on vegetables and the beef heart. Certainly worth going there if you want a special treat."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,5,12/19/15,"Went back again after a year away from Berlin - and Felix is still there doing his sommelier duties as efficiently as ever, Manuel was still looking after the front of house diligently and Michael is still cooking up eclectic modern dishes in his kitchen.So nothing seems to have changed much - the quality of food is as good as before though perhaps a little more sedate now that they have their 2nd Michelin star and the only major difference noted is that they don't offer the tuna spread with the breads anymore.But to more than compensate for the missing tuna spread, the desserts are stunningly awesome, as befits the young patissier, Thomas Yoshida, who was voted the Best Pattisier in Germany this year. So make sure you have room for the dessert courses."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,1,12/2/15,"We came with many hopes for a lovely lunch in a 2 star restaurant. The space was beutiful and plesent service. But that was it. The food was one of the werst we had for a long time.Lunch started with a complimentry salad, we received large plate with a foam in the middle. Undernth layed a very sour thing with the smell of a bad airplane food.The foolowing dishes suffered from the same problem of lack of inagination and horrible seasonin and very sour dishes.With wine it cost us 200 Euro.We finished lunch with no desire to try desert. Telling the waitress how we felt teceived us with no more than an understanding look, for sure not the reaction we looked for from what should be one of the best restaurants in BerlinMaybe we missunderstand the cuisin of the restaurant or maybe the kitchen had a bad day, but for sure it left us with bad test in our mouth on our last day in Berlin."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,4,6/28/14,"?380 for 2, not bad for Michelin 2 stars restaurant, the service was nice too, just the guy was trying to trick us getting more wine than what we needed. But the dessert and the searing is very pleasant."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,5,10/22/16,We went for lunch to celebrate an anniversary. Great experience. One of the best dining experiences in my life. Cannot wait to go back.
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,4,8/11/14,"I think one of the main selling points about Facil is the airiness of the restaurant.  It is so rare to find a restaurant in the middle of a capital city that is surrounded by trees (and when we visited) the floor to ceiling windows pushed open so it was a semi- al fresco experience.  Granted, that might not be for everyone as my brother in law didn't appreciate the wasps following him into the restaurant, but for al fresco fans, this place is awesome in the summer!The highlight of the lunch menu was definitely the desserts- all 3 we ordered were superbly made, well balanced and absolutely fantastic.  I enjoyed my starter (rockoctopus) and main (beef cheek), but felt that they were both a little on the salty side and while good, were not outstanding.I thought the lunch menu was decently priced- at 42 euros for 3 courses + 2 amuse bouches + petit four it seems pretty good value.  But that's probably because in London 30 quid probably won't quite get you a 2* lunch with so much variety...Definitely would come back, I can't wait to see how beautiful the glass cube of a restaurant will be in the snow."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,4,3/6/12,"One of the best restaurants in the city.The food is exactly what is expected from a star restaurant  ambitious and very not conservative, and and as such fails from time too time to be perfect, but only from time to time.The restaurant is very nice and modern. the service though, is quite peculiar, very berlinish  a little rude, a little cocky or in other words- not proffesional.2 People, Lunch with wine- 200EUR"
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,4,10/6/11,"This is a pretty decent restaurant and I am very glad to have found this place in Berlin.  I have never tried the lunch menu, but the dinner was fantastic.  I highly recommend the bison and the octopus, which was very well made.  This place also has an absolutely amazing pumpkin soup.  The restaurant itself is very classy and bright...the service was attentive and everyone was courteous.  My only complaint about this place is that everything was in small, but delicious, portions...so it's not a place to go if you're starving, like I usually am after a day of work.  But if you're in the mood for a nice, delicious dinner in a comfortable restaurant in Berlin...this is definitely the place."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,5,6/6/15,"We had lunch here on a Friday.  We were running late and arrived at 1:30pm so we were not able to do more than 4 courses since the kitchen closes at 3pm.  We did the cut down lunch menu for 45 Euro, which was a perfect amount of food for lunch.  The dining room is stunning.  Simply sitting in it without food and wine was breathtaking.  The sommelier was very helpful and recommended a Resiling for 50 Euro, which was one of the cheaper options on the list, but perfect for the cuisine.  The food was outstanding.  One of the best meals I have experienced.  The service was good but not outstanding for a restaurant of this caliber.  We will definitely be returning, but next time we will arrive closer to 12pm so we don't feel so rushed."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,4,3/3/12,"The food was great, the atmosphere ok, the service not competent.200 Euro for a lunch menu for 2 people and a bottle of wine. We were celebrating a birthday and i have asked the waitress for a birthday decoration on the cake  a candle for example. For a Michelin star restaurant that shouldt be a bizarre wish. The service was cold and placing a candle on a cake too challenging. 5 stars for the chef. 4 stars for the ambient 2 for service makes it 4 for the whole picture. here update: Our second visit wasn't such a success. i had 4 courses andonly the last one the desert was really amazing (something with cardamon-chai spices flavor ice-cream-muss)the duck was very dry and simply not tastythe fish with butter/gi-apple sauce diet work at all. a very weird combination. the apple-butter taste was so dominant that you couldn't taste any fish. also very greasy.(the fish alone without the sides was way better)the first course: salmon pastrami was overwhelmed with the taste of dill."
Facil,French,4.5,Above ?41,3,11/12/11,"Facil was OK. Food was nice, but really nothing amazing. Flavours were a little bland. Lovely to receive many complimentary amuse bouche, but even these were a bit meh. And the service was quite poor. Do they have rules against letting the staff smile while working? We don't mind paying for really, really good food  but I don't think Facil meets the standard you would expect for the price. Over-rated."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,10/24/17,"I loved this place so much. I loved my entire time in Berlin, but this place stood out. The staff was very friendly and I had great conversation with them. When I didn't like something, they replaced it for free and it was very good! Coffee was good, and the ambiance was awesome. Lots of creatives, and free magazines for reading while you are in the shop. Just a cool hip spot that made me feel cool for just being there."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,3,8/5/17,"Presented as a place to know to take a coffee in Berlin, I was a bit disappointed when I discovered it by myself. The sandwiches look tasty but are a bit expensive. The cafe in itself is not so big and it's maybe not the better place to work. There are many beautiful books you can buy but the price are not indicated. The garden is situated in the back and is very quiet. I saw a squirrel there."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,10/24/17,"Came here for a coffee break on a cold day in Berlin.  We got lucky because every table was full, but someone was leaving right as we entered.  If he hadn't been leaving, we would have had to find somewhere else because the place was full.  This is definitely a place where you can hang out for a long time on your computer/tablet which means that it can be tricky to get a table, but if you time it right I definitely recommend staying here.  Chai latte was good and not too sweet, and the quiche I had as a snack was very tasty."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,7/14/17,"It's on the pricier side, but this is great respite from the throngs of Mitte tourists -- only a short traipse from the Checkpoint Charlie area.We were looking for a light breakfast, and westberlin cafe was the perfect choice. I had a bacon quiche, which was delicious and actually quite filling, and tried some of my boyfriend's muesli. I'm no expert on muesli (this was my first) but we enjoyed it!The atmosphere is sleek, crisp with minimal fuss. It's the type of cafe where people sip coffee while tapping away at their laptops or hold a quiet startup business meeting about the design of their website."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,6/19/17,"I love this place. I thought the staff would be kind of cold but they were really friendly and nice. I loved the interior and all the cool magazines they had for sale (I had to pick up a couple...!) Also, lovely small bite food choices. I got the Bircher M?sli, it was delicious. The people with me got various things they all enjoyed. I'll definitely be coming back here. (Bonus: proximity to Checkpoint Charlie.)"
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,2,12/10/17,"Every time I've come here the staff have been consistently rude, and I've gotten similar reports from friends who live nearby. Once my friend was reprimanded for saying hi to someone who had already sat down with their food before he himself ordered, and I was once singled out for having a laptop at a table by the window (everyone around me had a laptop, a staff member shoved a sign in my face as though I couldn't read and told me to go to the back).The coffee isn't great, the chai lattes are far too spicy, the baked goods are always dry, and they serve their quiches cold after a 10 minute wait. Everything is overpriced. Hallesches Haus, Coffee Point, Einstein Kaffee, and Starbucks are all within a 2-15 minute walk of here. Don't waste your money or your dignity."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,1/15/16,"Yes sir.I'm a creature of habit, and one that I am not apt to break is that my mornings start with a good cup of coffee. While traveling through Europe, I wasn't willing to give this up, and thankfully Westberlin was close to my hotel, meaning I didn't have to travel TOO far to dodge the countless Starbucks and European equivalents. Westberlin serves thoughtfully prepared third wave coffee in a gallery-esque environment. I was able to get a truly excellent pour over and a pastry, sit at a clean and well-lit table while using their complimentary wifi. When the rest of my days are go-go-go, I cherish these quiet morning moments, and Westberlin provided it. And to find this in one of the most touristy centers of the city? Excellent."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,3/30/17,"The sandwich and quiches we ordered were a little bland, but the coffee and desserts were good."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,7/8/16,"This is a nice little coffee shop in the CheckPoint Charlie area of Berlin. I think literally down the block. No other review mentions breakfast but they have delightful selection of sandwiches and quiches!We sat for a nice quiet meal with good music and good atmosphere. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like everything was great but the tea could have been more quantity. They give you a 1/4 filled carafe which is essentially like 8 ounces. I like my quantity ! But hey if that's their worst fault, this place ain't half bad ! No seriously it was nice. Go there."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,10/13/16,"Really cute, hipster cafe.  I had a really good macchiato  and a piece of cake here.  The staff were nice, and there's plenty of seating and outlets for charging."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,10/30/16,"They run out of sandwiches so I got a salad. They have 3 types and they are made daily.I ordered the salad with blue cheese, pear slices, and walnuts. The dressing is horseradish. It can be pretty strong that you feel a brief burn in your nose. You'll get 2 small bread slices. I think it's sourdough bread. They take cards if the bill is over ?5.Pretty crowded. Most people had a laptop. Some read a newspaper. Contemporary furniture. Seems like a place to come and chill."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,10/12/16,"This coffee shop is adorable and a great place to work! At Westberlin, unlike many other places in Germany, it is totally acceptable to hang out and work on a laptop.Food and coffee are great! They offer a range of food options from pastries to sandwiches or salads for a small meal. The baristas are great, so expect cute latte art! They even offer a range of non-dairy milk options. (My barista said oat milk is her fave!) This is also one of the only places I've found in Berlin that offers customers free water which is a huge perk. The interior is super cool, and the coffee shop advertises an extensive magazine/ book collection that customers can browse. Both times I have been to Westberlin so far (in the mid afternoon) there was plenty of room to sit. There are also a fair amount of power outlets. I had to wait 30 minutes for one at the maximum. WiFi is fast and reliable. Westberlin seems to attract mostly students and young professionals in technology. There's lots of conversation about programming and design, much of which takes place English. It reminds me a little bit of a San Francisco spot for this reason."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,8/2/16,Awesome cafe. Lots of space and amazing pastries. They have the best cheesecake from five elephant. They don't have that many plugs so you can't rely on breaking your computer out. However they have decent coffee and it's a nice place to hang out with your friends especially if you're a tourist because it's in the touristy spot. It's definitely more on the expensive side. My friend Miranda says the carrot cake is also to die for. I love this cafe!
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,9/29/17,Perfect place for a coffee and a bite. Super cute and yummy. Seems like only locals here no tourists. Would come back!
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,7/15/16,"This was one of the first cafes I came to when I got to Berlin and one that I frequented the most during my 4 month stay. The brightly lit sit down cafe was very reminiscent of American coffee shops and it was almost as if I had hopped onto the plane to America and not the U-Bahn because of the amount of English speakers I heard there.Onto the food and drinks. Their mixed orange drink was my favorite. I'm not really sure what else they added in other than orange juice and ginger, but I always felt so much healthier and refreshed after this. Their flat whites are on point too. I'm not sure if I'm getting this right or not, but they get their beans and cheesecakes from Five Elephants. Would recommend especially if you're looking for a good place to settle in and get some work done along with a good snack."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,5/5/17,Lovely cafe with delicious and healthy breakfast and light lunch fare. The coffee is pretty good too. The atmosphere is pretty chill with an eclectic crowd and many folks working on their laptops. Very nice place to hang out and work or read many of their travel books.
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,8/20/17,"Stopped by after a long walk and happily ate some super delicious carrot cake and enjoyed iced coffees. A little local place with a mix of Germans reading the newspaper and Americans catching up with friends. Not too much choice for a meal, but great for a quick coffee and a sweet."
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,5,7/15/16,The only thing missing is more plugs. Food and Service is amazing. Fresh and tasty and plenty of vegan options required.
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,2/23/17,Nice coffee shop in the center of Berlin. Got a big choice of magazines and also offer places to work with nice WiFi. Coffee was great and the food looked also delicious.
Westberlin,Cafes,4,Under ?10,4,5/24/16,"Coffee & magazines down the street from Checkpoint Charlie. I ordered the flat white and was not disappointed. It appeared that the books & magazines were only for purchasing and not browsing as you sat there, which was a bit disappointing. Pleasant atmosphere with pleasant staff."
Al Mundo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,12/20/14,"Really, really good!!! I had a delicious chicken enchilada and it was delicious!! The service was very friendly and the menu had lots of options for different tastes."

Waiter: although it was busy, he was very nice  ( you don't meet that many nice waiters in Berlin in my opinion ... or maybe I'm just going to the wrong places? ;)anyhow, we'll be back to try out the breakfast :)"
Al Mundo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,6/29/14,Went there to watch the World Cup match Germany vs USA. Nice and cozy place with good atmosphere on a quiet side street. Great outdoor seating with good and friendly service. The food was subpar pub food though.
G?ll? Lahmacun,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,2/4/16,"""Wait, so what's the difference between lahmacun and g?zleme?"" my boyfriend asks me as we navigate the slushy sidewalks of Perleberger Stra?e.""Lahmacun is Turkish pizza, g?zleme is like a Turkish quesadilla.""""And we're going to a place called G?ll? Lahmacun to eat...g?zleme?""""Yes,"" I said, doubting whether this was indeed going to be the right restaurant. The first time I lived in Berlin, a friend of mine took me to this little restaurant tucked away on a random street corner whose name I could not for the life of me remember -- all I knew was that only women worked behind the counter, somewhat strange for this area. Thanks to some Internet sleuthing, I found out the name of the place and decided to go back for old times' sake. In the years since I was last there, not much has changed. We were warmly greeted by a woman tending to the large, decorative electric grill that sits in the front window and waited our turn to order. We ordered a cheese-and-spinach g?zleme for ?2.50 and took a stand in the corner to wait for her to prepare our food. The only one working, she ripped a chunk of dough from a pile sitting on a counter in a large plastic bag and put it through an automatic roller to get it to the perfect thinness. ""Scharf?"" she asked me, the only other woman in the restaurant, with a smile. Of course. Slowly but deliberately, she laid out the fillings, folded the dough over and set it on the grill, brushing it with some fat to give it that perfect gleam. After waiting 15 minutes -- nothing moves quickly here -- she sliced the g?zleme up into squares and piled it on a to-go plate for us to take with us on our way to a beer festival a few U-Bahn stations away.The best g?zleme I've ever had? Not really, and the price is a bit steep -- I've had better, bigger portions for less than ?2. But for a relaxed atmosphere and kind service, it's a sure bet. And for that, we certainly plan on heading back next time we're in the neighborhood."
G?ll? Lahmacun,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,4/30/16,A few month ago the prices went up. The owner just added 50 Cents to every article. To get full you need to spend arround 7-8 euros There are better options for the same money.
Hugos,German,4.5,Above ?41,5,10/27/17,Hugos is excellent. Can compete with best restaurants in Paris and San Francisco.
Hugos,German,4.5,Above ?41,4,12/7/17,"This was my first Michelin star experience so I was looking forward to everything that they had to offer. First of all please note that Hugos is in the Intercontinental Hotel at the top floor. The address can be a little confusing if traveling by taxi. We chose the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The first appetizer that arrived was a sampling plate that I enjoyed. The bread selection (pretzel, potato & onion were my favorite). The Sommelier (Manfred Welter) was absolutely amazing. The pairings complemented each individual dish perfectly. Manfred even went out of his way when it came to one of the wines that I did not enjoy. We chose Menu I, 4- Course Menu. The Octopus & Burrata took me back to my time when I lived in Greece off of the coast. Perfectly grilled and nowhere near rubbery. My favorite dish was the Canadian lobster. The flavor, texture made my taste buds jump up and dance. Then came the Milk-fed veal dish that was amazing. It was so succulent. I couldn't eat the Brussel sprouts but if you like them they are plenty. We had a pre-dessert of a chocolate cone with ice cream (vanilla bean) inside. It reminded me of a birthday hat based on the presentation. This I wish was my last memory but the Coconut & Almond was the final dish on the tasting menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish until I came to the last piece which was the brittle. The brittle to me was burnt and left a horrible taste in my mouth. I couldn't drink enough water/wine to clear my palette. This was by far the low point of my meal. Manfred went to the kitchen and tried to help pinpoint what the taste I had experienced but couldn't. We did get an after dinner/dessert of petit fours and coffee. The meal overall got better and better after every dish until I got to the brittle. You always remember how you start and how you finish and I can't let the finish go. I would love to give a 5 star but I can't and since yelp does not have  1/2 stars I have to give 4 stars."
Hugos,German,4.5,Above ?41,5,6/22/16,"Spectacular. Just...spectacular!We were lucky to get a reservation on the same day, which happened to be a gloriously sunny day in Berlin, and giving us a spectacular evening view of the city. From the moment of our arrival, the warm & friendly service never stopped. The team at Hugo's were wonderful: fun, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and very, very professional.Then the food...I simply can't rave enough about it! Stunning, delicious, extremely creative, and just...awesome. See my pictures. I had the 5-course dinner.The wine list was extensive, with a sensible range of options. The sommelier was also spot-on (of course!)If you are in Berlin, you would be doing yourself a great disservice by not going!"
Hugos,German,4.5,Above ?41,4,2/2/13,"Leckeres Essen, gute Auswahl und alles gut zubereitet. Die Blumenkolhsuppe war nicht gut gew?rzt, ansonsten war alles gut. Hab allerdings schon besseres gegessen in der Preisklasse!"
Hugos,German,4.5,Above ?41,5,7/25/08,"If money is burning a hole in your pocket, or if you must impress someone, then Hugo's is as good a place as one can find to help you part with your money. Mind you, they do it in such a nice way that you may even not notice, as the service is impeccable, the views over Berlin and the general ambience is great and Thomas Kammeier follows perfectly Gary Rhodes' simple concept of allowing fine ingredients to do the talking. The restaurant is located at the top of the Inter-Continental Hotel, and offers lovely views over Berlin, especially during sunset. The initial impression is that the place is rather long but the tables are spread out elegantly along the long glass windows and offered adequate privacy. The food is very good, perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, but one gets the impression that it is almost too perfect. What I mean to say is that, every dish is superbly well-cooked but somehow, a few dishes lacked the drama of an unexpected spice or the nuances of an interesting herb. But this is NOT a criticism - it is just that every dish just tasted exactly as I expected, which is no bad thing, although I would not have minded a bit more of a culinary adventure. Anyway, I think the degustation menu was somewhere around 220 Euro, but you do get a lot of dining for that, and I can recommend it heartily, as long as your expense account can bear it! By the way, this was voted the Restaurant of the Year in Berlin some time ago, and standards have not dropped. It also has at least one Michelin star and was also the Best Trend Restaurant in Germany, whatever that means. If 220 Euro does not scare you off, then you can also consider the Vitrum in the Ritz-Carlton, where they have a new cook who I will check out next time I am in Berlin."

Esra II,Turkish,4,Under ?10,4,8/31/11,"Fresh, tasty and cheap, 2,50 for a Haloumi sandwich that will definitely get you through a busy afternoon. What else could you ask for? This place recently changed hands and got a facelift. It's my go to when I want something quick, filling, and served with a friendly attitude."
Esra II,Turkish,4,Under ?10,1,1/22/17,Got sexually harrased by one of his waiters. Tried to get a schawarma on Thursday night before he was closing and he asked several times touching his **ick for me to suck it... Thanks for the bad memories Esra II
Esra II,Turkish,4,Under ?10,5,11/11/12,"best schawarma, k?fte and falafel i personally know of in berlin. the food is always fresh, service quick and friendly as well as clean. prices are also good. highly recommended!"
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/26/14,"Oh, us silly Americans!After a long day of touristing all around Berlin we hit the 5PM mark and were completely famished.  We had already sought Follerei out based on research and proximity to our apartment and walked up to grab a table.  Naturally, they did not open until roughly 7PM.  Who eats that early?!We grabbed snacks and beers to take home and went back to the restaurant around 9PM, a more respectable dining time.  It's a cute little restaurant.  Ya know, small, about the size of something I would want if I ever owned a restaurant.  Intimate enough to really get to know the staff providing service and food.  The menu was not in English and, knowing very little German, the owner saw our struggle and went through each and every item on the menu.  That's amazing for someone to do and we were extremely appreciative of it.I ordered the salmon with lentils and potatoes.  I cannot tell you the name of it on the menu but, if you dine here, ask the owner for it and you will not be disappointed.  It was plentiful, cooked perfectly (crisp on the outside but super soft on the inside, if that makes any sense), and the perfect alternative to all the meat I had been eating that entire week.  We never felt as if we were being rushed through our meal, either.  Coming from a big city, I feel everyone is always in a hurry, but I never felt that way here or in Berlin.  It's a little pricey compared to all of the quick restaurants in the area, but we were on vacation and did not mind.  Plus, the food was so good it was completely worth the visit.  If you find yourself in Neukolln, find yourself here... but at a respectable hour, of course!"
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,4,1/20/18,"Overall really very good: German classics such as Bratwurst or Schweineschnitzel with Rotkohl or Sauerkraut. Winter comfort food! Friendly service by a funny Italian and price wise perfectly OK for the quality and portion size. Only small quibble on this particularly cold winter evening is that it could have been a bit warmer, but we were amongst the first arrivals and it probably warmed up later. Will be back!"
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/29/17,Came here for the bio (organic) dishes. Tried both the vegan and meat entr?es and loved them equally. Very healthy and yummy.
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/26/17,"Is it German or is it French?  Went looking for a French place recommended and Yelp sent us here. They consider it a German restaurant, but is a lot more than Brats and schnitzel. I had the fish of the day, Dorado crisp on risotto with peas. Excellent. My husband had lamb chops with carrots and polenta. Mine was better. And definitely prepared with the French touch of farm fresh products. The dessert was great, pancotta and rhubarb sorbet. Yum. With house white wine the bill for 2 about ?70. Cash only."
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,4,3/12/16,"Very nice German dishes, organic meat. Service ok. With a smile on their face I would have felt more welcome. Few vegan options. Go for the lamb and the Bratwurst."
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,4,9/21/15,"Nice place!The Panna Cotta with raspberry sauce and rosemary crumble is delicious...you should make your way out here just to try that."
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/24/14,"Lovely casual fine dining for German fare. My friend, a local, brought me here on the premise of ""German food, but kind of fusion"" which still required a bit of a leap of faith, but I was pleasantly impressed! Typical German restaurants come with heavy dishes of meat and potatoes, and while there were meat and potatoes on the menu (I had the wiener schnitzel after all) there was a much higher level of care and preparation. I would definitely come back!"
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/23/14,"Favorite restaraunt in Berlin. The decor is minimalist and attractive, and the weiss beer they serve is the best I've had yet. My food was great. I had a bratwurst and risotto, both of which were unpretentious, but fresh and delicious. Our waitress was professional but personable; she was kind enough to go over the German menu with us (a bunch of ignorant Americans), and when one of us had to duck out early to nurse a persistent head cold, she took the time to go grab ibuprofen from the back. The prices are a little higher than what you'll pay for a schwarma down the street, but completely appropriate for a good meal in Berlin. Just a great place."
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,3,12/17/11,"Good service, nice place, but the food is simply overpriced. When I pay 6.50 euro for a salad in Berlin, I dont expect it to be a starter, I expect to have filling ingredients inside, a variety of lettuce and a good dressing. Served with bread, it needs to fill me up in a healthy way. Main courses around 10 euro are too expensive, they are neither large portions nor particularly tasty. Its not a restaurant , more of a bistro that is trying to be what it is not. New chef, new menu, new prices and we would be there once a week."
F?llerei,German,4.5,?11-20,5,12/16/10,"I just returned from a marvelous supper at the F?llerei.  Nord-Neuk?lln is probably my favorite area of Berlin (particularly for restaurants and bars), and F?llerei just assumed a position at the top of the list.  It's a snowy night, and many Berliners stayed in.  I walked in with two friends around 8pm and we were the only people inside.  Even the two women who run the place were in back, but as soon as we walked in the door, they rushed out to greet us eagerly, with a warm ""Kommt doch rein!""It just got better from there.  A cozy, inviting interior; rotating installations from local artists; a house beer made locally especially for the restaurant; and an entirely organic menu with dishes that taste like homemade gourmet rather than restaurant food made for one of the best dining out experiences I've had in recent memory.  For what they have to offer, F?llerei is very inexpensive:  30 Euro for three meals, two of which included drinks (which are also organic).The hostesses, atmosphere, and delectable food--whole pea soup with fried potatoes, mushroom risotto with green beans, organic bratwurst with sauteed greens and roasted potatoes, followed by a delicious chocolate cake--make F?llerei one of my new favorite places in Berlin.  I can't wait to come back, and I only wished I lived in Berlin so I could come here on a regular basis!"
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,1/21/18,great food! recommend the red beets with goat cheese and walnut
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,12/30/17,"Amazing food, friendly staff, great athmosphere. The place seems always crowded, so better reserve a table. No complaints, food came quickly and was really yummy. I can recommend the fish k?fte!! Mega YUM!"
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,4,2/5/17,"I have to start by saying the restaurant is quite expensive. However it is a great place to have a good dining experience, especially for groups. The food itself it quite testy and decent portions. But I should warn not to fill up on the appetisers. They do have have quite an extensive selection of them and one can easily forget he has a main course to come."
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,3,3/14/17,"Everything looks very nice but if you like traditional turkish cuisine, better go somewhere else. Quite expensive modern dishes are ok but nothing really special. Looking at menu and beautiful decorations all around you may expect more. Our table was less than 5 cm from others so better don't plan romantic dinner there, rather group meeting or family meal."
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,4,6/2/16,"Good food, nice wait staff, expensive but not unreasonably so."
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,3,4/24/16,"We had a mixed experience: We ordered a 4-pieces mix aperitif and it was pretty good. You get different kind of delicious dips and good bread. The main dish was compared to that  just so so. A real downer was the quality of their house wine. It was just very like cooking wine ... definitely not something you want to spent 10 Euros on for half a liter. Also they charge you half a fortune for water. Even when Germany is in general  a little off in this department, 5 Euros for 0.5 liters is way over the top. Water should be free!!!"
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,4,7/23/14,"We had a lovely dinner sitting outside on a warm summer night! The food was delicious! My friend, a major foodie and Turkish, even approved! Very fresh ingredients and light aromatic flavors. Yum! I would recommend ordering family style. We ordered three dishes for three people, but shared everything. The flavors of our sardines, muscles, and eggplant roles complimented each other very well. I would not have enjoyed the experience as much if I had only gotten to taste one of the three dishes.The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Nice design, good presentation of food. The service was friendly, although a bit rough around the edges. Not bad, but could also use improvement. The menu, for example, lists the dishes by their turkish names, but our waiter asked that we translate the names into German when we ordered. It is fine that she does not speak Turkish or course, but she could learn the menu of the restaurant she works at, at the very least. Imagine a similar scenario at an Italian or French restaurant. There were other small things, like the confused reaction we got when we asked for olive oil to dip our bread in, that just made me think, ""heh?"" But we always got a friendly reaction as we explained ourselves."
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,9/4/15,"This was a delicious meal served in a lovely, modern restaurant.  The food was exceptional:  subtle, delicious, elegant.  We were 8 people and tried many appetizers and main courses.  The Turkish white whine was very good, but the food outshined any I have had in New York, even with my Turkish friends.My favorite dishes were the tortellini with yogurt sauce (these are NOT Italian tortellini) and the meatballs.  And the cigar (borek) appetizer."
Osmans T?chter,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,3/23/14,"Had been there on a Friday night for dinner with a few friends. Delicious food, wine not too bad, super friendly and welcoming staff plus pretty and inviting interior."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,12/22/17,"If you are visiting Berlin for even just one day, this is must see. For three main reasons...First, they are known as the best German chocolatiers in Berlin. The the store is beautiful, central to other tourist destinations and they have chocolate replicas of Berlin icons like the Brandenburger Tor.Second, you need to bring home gifts for loved ones, and German chocolate is a great option. The prices are affordable for what you are buying. Third, they have a cafe above the store that allows you to indulge in some delicious German chocolate while you're there. I recommend making a reservation online before stopping by. It is best to go for breakfast or afternoon tea, if you are just looking for chocolate treats."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,12/6/17,"This is a good spot for a sweet treat or a nice sits after a long day of sightseeing. There's a huge retail space on the first floor with every type of chocolate imaginable, from basic bars to exquisite petit fours. The smell of chocolate is heavenly, and there's even a few chocolate sculptures to admire (on my visit, it was a chocolate volcano complete with melted chocolate lava and a model of the Titanic).If you're looking for a bite to eat, go all the way to the back and take the glass elevator up to the cafe section. There you'll find a selection of delectable desserts available for table service. We tried the chocolate chip cookie dough cake, with chocolate mousse and a little circle of unbaked cookie dough. It was really rich and delicious, but didn't quite blow me out of the park.You should definitely try their hot chocolate, which is like drinking LIQUID GOLD. And by gold, I mean incredibly rich melted chocolate. They even have a dark chocolate version, which is sweet without being overwhelming.If you're a chocolate lover or just shopping for one, you'll be in overload. It's a little pricy, but well worth a stop."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,10/30/17,"It's like drinking heaven. You must try their hot chocolate once in your life time! I had their Irish hot chocolate, and it's the best I've ever had. Their rich chocolate and smooth cream mixed with whiskey...mmmmmmNot so much fan of their cake tho. Felt like they used too much gelatin in their mousse. If I come next time, I'll just order their hot chocolate.Price wise, it's just slightly pricey...but hey, there r still tons of people coming back to drink this heaven. :)They constantly have a line, but you will be seated within 15 mins or so....I love their dark chocolate"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,5/22/17,"This review is for the shop downstairs only. In what can only be described as heaven for chocoholics, Fassbender & Rausch is a must-stop in Berlin. I would even say if you are into fine chocolates, this store may even be worth a trip to the city!When you first set foot inside the doors, you're greeted with an overwhelmingly delicious scent of chocolate. How I wish these smells could be bottled! Part of this is due to the giant candy carvings that are rotated to match the season. Since it was the spring, I saw a several foot tall bunny as well as handcrafted chocolate versions of the Brandenburg Gate, the TV tower, and an ""active"" chocolate volcano that bubbled and spewed real melted chocolate! Luckily these sculptures are in plain view so you can even peek through the windows after closing. They are works of art, and photography is encouraged!The shop boasts the ""world's largest praline counter"" with over 200 different types of pralines. There are also what seems like miles of gorgeous truffles (almost too pretty to eat -- ALMOST) and mini tortes. For the kiddos, you can select from pre-wrapped candies shaped like teddy bears and more, and there are lots of classy looking gift boxes to purchase as souvenirs for friends and family back home. My favorite area of the store is the by the pound chocolate almond bark, so delicious and the perfect way to get just the amount you want without having any waste. This works like a department store and you can either purchase your selections at each individual department counter or collect them in a basket and pay all at once before you exit. This is a chocolate lover's paradise and is not to be missed."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,11/1/17,"I am not giving 5 stars for the quality of the chocolate but for the beautiful store and the excellent customer service.  The chocolate itself is pretty decent however it is very reasonably priced.  If your friends and neighbors are not chocolate connoisseurs then their nicely packaged goods make great gifts.  It is worth a visit to see their chocolate sculptures of the Reichstag, Brandenburg Tor and Kaiser Wilhelm Kirche if you are in the area.Again their chocolate and hot chocolate are pretty good but at their low prices don't expect Sprungli, La Maison du Chocolat or Pierre Marcolini quality."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,6/23/17,"I do not love chocolate, but this store will make you appreciate it. I'm a believer now. My wife loves chocolate, so I wanted to take her to a place that celebrates and represents German chocolate while we were in Berlin; I took the advice of fellow Yelpers and dang, they hit the nail on the head with this place. It has been around forever and is a staple of Berlin's downtown area. For reference, we're from New York and the area this place is in really reminded us of midtown...just with much wider streets. Anyway, it's on the corner of a big downtown commercial area. Whatever, that doesn't matter. None of that matters.What matters is: THEY HAVE A HUGE SCULPTURE OF THE REICHSTAG AND THE BRANDENBURG GATE MADE OUT OF CHOCOLATE! And a life size chocolate bear! And everything else in the world imaginable that a chocolate lover could possible dream up! It's crazy. I don;t even like chocolate and it got me excited. This is definitely a must-stop-in for Berlin. Check it out!"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,11/23/17,"A great chocolate store with so many options. I ordered the Mango Tart, Nougat Mousse Cake, and the White Chocolate Symphony. All of it was delicious. I also bought some of their alcohol-free chocolate and it was also good."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,12/24/16,"When in Gendarmenmarkt, you have to stop by and drool at the magnificent creations that is Rausch. The triple euro signs ??? are not a mistake. From the magical chocolate creations on display at the store to their exquisite truffles and handmade chocolate pieces, this is without a doubt, the finest chocolaterie in Berlin. Stumped on what souvenirs to take home? they have varying gift sets at different price points. If you want to indulge on a small piece of cake, they have those too. I suggest allotting at least 30 minutes of your time to browse, look, taste and spend! Your friends and family will thank you for the taste that is Rausch.Wundersch?n!"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,11/2/16,"Fine chocolates in Berlin!Got some for gifting and they make it a pleasant delight for the chocolate lovers!It's located in central downtown. Convenient and delicious chocolate shop!"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,4/9/17,"Wow. Just wow. I concur with all other recommendations of hot chocolate and chocolate treats. Best dessert spot, which has been hard to come by in Berlin. I ordered a glass of red, Venezuelan hot chocolate with amaretto and espresso, and Carmel and nut symphony cake. (I was on sugar overload afterwards. Definitely split a cake if you're getting a hot chocolate as well). My friend ordered the Venezuelan hot chocolate with baileys and Irish whiskey. She was in heaven. It was everything she had wanted and hoped for (she has a sweet tooth). Must stop on bucket list in Berlin."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,6/19/17,"Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate *throws confetti* - as far as the eyes can see. This place is amazing (the chocolate store itself). This was my second visit and it didn't disappoint. The amazing displays of chocolate with the amazing creations of the Titanic, the Brandenburg Gates, etc - works of art! There was so much to choose from that my partner was a bit frazzled. We settled on a few items and found the prices really reasonable for a store like this in such a prime location. Compared to prices back home for similar quality and presentation, this was cheaper (price was, not quality).I really wanted one in its stunning box but was thinking the box would cost more than the regular paper box that it came in. I checked the prices and they were identical with or without the ornate wooden box. NICE! So of course I got the ornate box that looks like a cigar case. Every time we open it to offer it to friends they feel a bit awkward because it looks so fancy. We decided to use it as a souvenior box for our trip after we're done eating all the chocolates inside.The chocolate quality here is superb. They also make great gifts. We shoved a couple in our suitcases to bring home."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,5/23/17,"Beautiful and Elegant old world chocolate store with prices to match.  A must stop when in Berlin Germany.Rating: 5 Stars"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,2/10/16,"Our server was super nice the hot chocolate was on point but my friend's chocolate drink was too rich and too sweet ... He couldnt even finish itThe tiramisu tarte was also very delicious and not too expensive. A lot of souvenirs are also very reasonably priced and look cute. The chocolate pralines are still subpar to those in Belgium or Switzerland though :("
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,11/21/17,Exquisite place for a coffee and a cake! I had such a beautiful and extremely good tasting tart and cappuccino. The price is very reasonable for the quality you get
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,7/12/16,"This review is for you fellow chocoholics...and you non-chocoholics, prepare to be converted!I'd read up in advance about this place so we timed our visit with a trip to the Gendarmenmarkt Christmas Market; Rausch sits on the corner of this gorgeous square so there's another excuse (like it's needed) to visit.So...the ground floor...for a start it is full of jaw-droppingly amazing chocolate sculptures (toy soldiers were cute and festive but the detail of the Reichstag sculpture was phenomenal!) then there is box upon box of chocolates, chocolate bars, slabs and even a mini Brandenburg Gate to buy as well as the best chocolate counter with every flavour combination imaginable. I would definitely class these chocolates in the ""treat"" category as they aren't the cheapest but hey, when on holiday!... I couldn't resist so bought as much as would fit in my hang luggage (tubs of raspberry and espresso truffles included and oh so delicious) and decided I'd just have to wear all my chunky things on the flight home lol.Then...hidden at the back of the shop is a lift to what can only be described as chocolate heaven...or more precisely, their chocolate caf? and restaurant, oh my!  Booking is definitely recommended.  We hadn't received that memo so had a 15-20 minute wait for a table coming free in the caf? (but it was worth the wait). After much deliberation, and I mean much...we all opted for their speciality hot chocolate. First, choose from a milk or dark hot chocolate, then add your flavour: orange, chilli, ALCOHOL just a few I can remember and I have to say, hands down the best hot chocolate I've had to date.We all picked a mini torte from the menu too, each having something different so we could share as they all sounded and looked amazing, and they were. My chocolate mini torte had a dark choc mouse, moist sponge, milk choc ganache and decorative pieces on top, yikes!  These were roughly ?5 I'm sure and a total steal in my view given the detail in them.Although the caf? was rammed, we were served promptly, with a smile and nothing seemed too much bother.Sadly, we never ate in the restaurant but we had a nosey at the menu and you can easily sit down for a 3 course chocolate meal! Some options featured a hint of chocolate where as others went all out - needless to say it's definitely on my radar for a return trip!Given half the chance, I would have spent my entire Berlin trip here but I would have needed a wheelbarrow to roll me onto the plane if I had!  Quite simply, this place is awesome.  The only thing that could possibly make this more awesome is if the building was made of chocolate too!"
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,7/17/16,"An elegant chocolate producer that doesn't exclude the everyday folks from coming in, perusing their selection and purchasing candy.The place is filled with Berlin buildings and other items made completely out of chocolate. Quite the edible and artistic accomplishment.The chocolate candies purchased from behind the glass case were all unique and tasty. They had several dozen options to choose from so choosing was difficult.The staff was friendly, too. As soon as I recover from my binge chocolate eating I'll be back for more."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,2/16/17,"Huge selection of Chocolates.Their hot chocolate is also great, which you can get either inside the cafe or as take out."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,8/29/16,"Great place for chocolate lovers. Avoid the figures and go directly for the bars. On the first floor there is a cafe where you can try their cakes or drink a nice chocolate. Not a cheap place and they have the bad habit of putting little posts indicating the tables near the window are booked at 5:15, funnily all of them maybe just for locals, not sure."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,4/5/17,"The cafe upstairs had great selection of desserts and hot chocolate. I got the Irish hot chocolate and tiramisu cake, both were delicious. I bought a lot of chocolates here as gifts for people back home and they loved it. Definitely recommend a visit to this place."
Rausch Schokoladenhaus,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,2,8/1/17,"The dessert were NOT good at all(though many posts gave a 5 stars), but the waiter who waited our table was SUPER kind and nice!!! I wouldn't go back again tho....."
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,11/4/17,Very good food for cheap price and great service! Would go there again next time I'm in Berlin.
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,5/13/17,"I had a wonderful dinner here. Although a bit pricier than other options, the food was excellent. I ordered the large squid as my meal and it was cooked to perfection. The service was very friendly. Wonderful place to sit outside, look at Checkpoint Charlie and enjoy a nice meal!"
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,12/20/15,"Wow. Ich dachte that this lugar was nur another trap de las turistas cos it's so near das Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. ?ay caramba! Mit the suggestion of the waiter (who had the same smooth movements as a pianist pouring drinks and setting them on the table), wir tried the cava sangria con cava. Nuestro mesero made a few mistakes with the dishes (missed unser patatas bravas and brought uns die falsche plato), but the food was fantastic. Some might call it too salty, but I thought meine dish was perfect. The papas era muy schmeckt, and the cooked the way I try to cook them myself. The chicken stuffed mit ham und queso was moist and grilled well. My wife's seafood was fantastiche. Das wirklich schmeckt. Try these dishes."
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,1/29/16,"We have a really strange habit of eating in places called Barcelona when we're on holiday, so as soon as we spotted this little restaurant on the way to our hotel we knew we had to try it. It was cemented by the fact that we love Spanish tapas, and a friend also recommended it to us as being some of the best tapas he's had.Whilst I wouldn't go that far, I did thoroughly enjoy it! Just a stones throw from Checkpoint Charlie, Barcelona is surprisingly secluded which makes a nice change from the touristy hustle and bustle. They have a very thorough cocktail menu and the wine menu seemed decent at a glance also.In terms of the food selection, they offer pretty much everything you would expect from a Spanish tapas restaurant. We were only stopping for lunch so *tried* to be good and just order four - Patatas Bravas, Albondigas (meatballs), Chorizo and the Croquettes - but we still ended up with a bit too much food. Isn't that always the way? Food was really great, however the menus could have done with a bit more in terms of descriptions.Staff were absolutely lovely and happy to give us recommendations of other things to do in the city. It was pretty affordable and all in all a nice little find!"
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,10/11/16,Very good food for a good price. Tried the bisteck which was delicious. Definitely would go back there.
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,2,10/6/15,"Wine list was not only limited, but I did not feel my glass had the flavor described. If I had only known they had a hand written cocktail menu behind the door I would have ordered one instead. Wifi was broken, and with the locals not being friendly towards Americans (or others too?) it was a waste of time and a let down for an experience while visiting."
Barcelona Restaurant,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,5/2/15,"BarceLona, as they style it, is a little off the tourist grid but is definitely a worthy find.  Great food, good wine list including a variety of self-imported regional Spanish wines, pleasant surroundings, and competent waitstaff.  What more could you ask for?We ate exclusively off the tapas menu but they serve paella and several entrees as well.  We always plan trips to Germany to coincide with spargel (asparagus) season and the spargel suppe at BarceLona was as good as we've ever eaten.  We also had outstanding jamon Iberico, and grilled sardines (sardines plancha) that were out of this world.  All that and more were washed down with a bottle of Luis Alegre Crianza - a delightful wine to have with food.  This Crianza has a short finish so it does not overly influence the flavor of the next bite.  Good stuff.We were, so far as I can tell, the only non-Germans in the restaurant the night we were there.  Nevertheless, our waitress spoke good English as dis the manager.  We never double dip restaurants when we travel but we may return to BarceLona for a lunch while we're here."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,11/19/14,"AMAZING FOOD!We had a seafood pasta and a homemade beetroot wasabi ravioli with sallad. Both tasted like heaven.One of the best rhubarb schorles I ever tasted. Dessert was a mascarpone and elderflower saga with berries. Everything 5 star.On top of this: super friendly and happy laid back staff, good English, great place and cozy atmosphere. Am going back today again :-)(Expect it to always be fully booked. Either you have to wait for quite some time or even smarter - reserve a table!)"
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,9/10/16,"Food is delicious, there's no arguing in that. Came here with a group of 15 people to celebrate my birthday! We called in advance and booked the table, so that wasn't an issue.Service was a little bit too slow though, which I heard has always been one of their weak points. Otherwise, no complaints!"
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,5/17/16,"Hidden gem. CASH ONLY. Great for dates.North African/French cuisine, with nice wine assortment.  My bf & I are meat lovers & enjoy the mixed grill platters, oriental meat platter (with lamb, merguez, cous-cous, chicken, etc.)-  as well as the angus roast beef steak drizzled with red wine/orange sauce & sides  of green asparagus & roasted potatoes. For vegetarians, you'll also find stuff on the menu.  Something for everyone...The dessert of the day was holunderberry  mousse (normally lavender mousse, but they ran out on Sunday evening) on a ""himbeerspiegel"" (raspberry mirror).  Extremely rich, creamy, yet fluffy & delicious... Again: Romantic place, great for dates- preceded or followed by a walk along Maybachufer riverside.  The lighting is also warm, dark & sexy-  again:  perfect for looking your best/most enticing  on a date...(you're welcome, ladies.). :-)"
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,12/29/16,Wow... this place bomb. Dude with long hair was so nice and he even translated the menu in French but I don't speak French so he reversed straight to english. Prawns were so fresh. Lamb was amazing. Both of my girls were feeling happy and relaxed. Thank you.
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,2,10/30/16,Unfortunately I have to give it a 2 stars. Very disappointed. Late service. Amateur appetisers. And An incredibly sad steak with some potatoes. My breakfast this morning was a royal meal compared to it.  I had friends over and wanted to impress them with the chill Berliner atmosphere and nice food at candle light. Thought that cafe Jaques would have been a safe choice.. well I was wrong. Totally out of my nice restaurant list. Sad..as I liked it..
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,8/30/16,Wonderful place. The server patiently explained the menu in English to us and the food was delicious and reasonably priced.
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,9/22/16,"Excellent service, amazing flavorful food! We were visiting Berlin from NY and our German is nonexistent. The staff and owner were incredibly accommodating and friendly. They helped us pick a delicious meal and made our visit a great experience. Definitely recommend this neighborhood gem with more locals than tourists. The location is perfect with plenty of options for after dinner drinks as well."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,5/16/16,"Excellent little french place. Husband-wife duo, super friendly, great menu, very fine food. Lamb, casserole, chicken, all excellent. Then there's creme brulee. I'm getting hungry just writing this review."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,4/22/16,"Went with two girlfriends and shared all the dishes. Don't be confused by the name of the restaurant... it's really more Lebanese-French than French-French. Regardless, our cous cous with lamb and seafood grill dish was excellent and the waitress was really sweet and didn't mind translating all the dishes on the chalk board."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,10/20/14,"Had dinner here during a trip to Europe and what a little gem we discovered.Delicious (generous pouring of too!) house wine to sip on, along with wonderful ravioli that has the best sauce for dipping in bread!Additionally, the candlelight setting is the perfect atmosphere for a fun and relaxed night."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,2,2/13/15,"In a nutshell, Cafe Jacques has decent food which is ruined by poor service and a generally strange attitude that pervades the place. With no menus, you have towalk across the room to peer at a blackboard of daily specials which our waiter declined to explain or even talk about. Ditto with the wine. The first of our group of ten to arrive were alternately harassed for not immediately ordering drinks and told to sit down when trying to look at the menu. Our waiter periodically lectured us for not ordering sparkling water with the several bottles of wine we ordered (telling us he was going to charge us for the tap water we were drinking), and hurried us into ordering food which led to a mad relay of ppl trying to check out the blackboard menu. That said, the food was pretty good (seafood linguine, lamb with roast potatoes). The final straw came when a trio (cello, accordion and something else) entered the restaurant and played a couple of tunes, after which money was aggressively demanded from us. Quirky is fine, but bad (and frankly bizarre) service and treatment of customers isn't. I was disappointed at choosing to celebrate my birthday here."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,12/11/13,"On a rather cold and wet trip to Berlin, my travel companion and I were staying in the Prenzlauerberg area of Berlin and were looking for a place nearby that we could have dinner after a long day (we were both flying into Berlin very early that morning). Caf? Jacques was within walking distance from the U-Bahn station that we were adjacent to. This place has had some good reviews, but we wanted to give it a go anyway. The reviews are darn right about this small joint with an amazing menu and a great vibe. Certainly make sure you make a reservation if you're coming here because it gets really packed and we were really lucky to get a spot in here without any reservations. The staff here are ?ber friendly. We didn't speak any German, but the staff were willing to converse with us in English and even translate pretty much the entire menu for us (and yes, there's no English menu here - which is actually a good thing). We settled on a pita and hummous starter and pasta and a veal main for our mains. The wine list is absolutely amazing and even the basic wines are absolutely delicious. We both had the Temperanillo which arrived in huge glasses with generous pours. Serving sizes were also very large for Europe (albeit, everything is bigger in Germany ;)). This place is definitely off the charts and for a somewhat ""hole in the wall"" type place, it was absolutely phenomenal. If I'm ever in Berlin again, I would definitely come back here. Great food, great music, great atmosphere and certainly a great city."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,3/21/13,"I went with a friend on a hot night at 22:00 and it was full. We had to wait a good 15 minutes for a table. We had Gazpacho, which was served in a very generous bowl. It was good although with a few faults (they didn't seed the peppers and it was spicy). We saw how large the portions of the other client?le and decided to share a plate between the two of us. We ordered the couscous plate but it was sold out. We ended up with a mixed Mediterranean plate (lamb, chicken, merguez, tabbouleh, hummus, etc.). It was definitely large enough. We then had the best part of the meal, dessert: it was fig mousse with a chocolate sauce.The service was great and the client?le was very international and friendly. This review was written in 2010."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,12/29/14,"Possibly our best restaurant visit of 2014. Party of four, every one impressed by the quality of the food and wine. I had the Fleischgrill (mixed grill) and the meat was tender and tasty, no trace of MSG. Others raved about the red snapper and chestnut ravioli. Good wine list, and advice thereon. Staff were cordial, personal and for the most part, prompt. We'll be back!"
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,7/19/13,"Went there because it was recommended by Lonely Planet and were not disappointed.  The menu is short and in German however, every waiter spoke enough English to read the menu to us.The food is as good as you can expect in a German restaurant: kind of plain.  Atmosphere is excellent: dark, candle-lit interior and cozy outside seating (we went after dark).I would recommend this place for anyone looking to dine in great atmosphere and wishing some simple food and alcohol.WARNING: smoking is permitted insider after 11pm (when the street seating closes)."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,6/22/11,"I was here once, long time ago.I do not remember much....but i definetly could remember valuable details: the amazing wine, the funny guitar player, the big round table with many Friends....and the friendly owner with the che Guevara look and the big friendly smile."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,8/22/13,"Came here because Lonely Planet listed it as top choice in the area, and this was one of the best dining experiences for us in Berlin. The place is small and cozy with great ambience and friendly staff. The owner, Ahmad, is charismatic and funny, his wine recommendation was on point. The menu is a blackboard menu that consists of a variety of types of dishes. All of the vegetables and seafood was really fresh and everything was exquisite. The lamb dish was absolutely delicious and so was the seafood linguini and the ""fish variety"" dish. We had a great time, the place is recommended for anyone that wants to have a nice night with awesome food by the river."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,4,5/23/10,"Where is Jacques from? Actually his real name is Gustav and he's Swedish, or maybe not. Regardless, his restaurant is a superbly charming affair, dark and cozy, relaxed and cool. The food is a melagne of all sorts really, and there didn't appear t be a menu as such. Just bring us some starters, and then something else. Whatever you like? Rabbit? Check! Sadly, or maybe not, I consumed so much strong alcohol I can remember little of the experience. So I will surely be back."
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,2/9/14,Excellent atmosphere and amazing food. I've been there twice and the staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive. Highly recommended. Be sure to book a table. The place is packed - rightfully so.
Caf? Jacques,French,4,?11-20,5,4/15/13,"Small, cosy place with lots of ambiance! Jacques walks about schmoozing with all the guests, helping people choose wines etc. We had a wonderful 3-course dinner at a bargain price (compared to Stockholm...), will certainly return here next time we are in Berlin."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,4,8/8/17,"Very pretty restaurant in a very nice area. The service is more German than French, but the food is great. The starters especially superb. Not a lot of vegetarian options, but if you're into meat or fish, you're good."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,4,5/9/17,"We read the reviews and came in expecting a full restaurant where we'd have to wait. Somehow it only had 2 tables with 4 people total in the restaurant. We were confused. Was it the bad weather? had the restaurant gone downhill? With my 4 star rating, obviously the restaurant hadn't gone downhill! The asparagus soup was delicious especially with the bacon/salami or whatever bits were inside. SO delicious! The pulpo (octopus) entree was amazing. The octopus was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the portion size was great. SO good! The bulgar with squid ink was also very tasty. The reason I knocked off a star is because the bulgar had raw green onions/shallots in it and it was so overpowering and ruining the delicate taste of everything else. I was trying to pick it out. My partner said this was her favorite meal in the entire Germany leg of the trip...and we ate at a lot of restaurants so that says a lot. We'd happily come back here. It's such a cute restaurant that felt really warm and rustic."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,2,10/8/17,"Poulette used to be one of my favorites in the area. Unfortunately, it's not what it used to be. While the food is still really good, the service is very slow and unprofessional. We had to wait for almost 1.5 hours for our main course. It was very disappointing."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,3/8/17,"We were visiting Berlin and had a yen for French cuisine, so a local storekeeper sent us to Poulette.  What a find in former East Berlin!  The prix fixe menu for lunch was excellent.  There  was a vegetarian option for my daughter, a lovely and savory pork cutlet option for the two meat lovers and a third option as well.  And of course, there were three choices for the first course and two choices for dessert as well.  The service was good and the food was just amazing.  Highly recommend this place."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,11/25/14,"A true gem of a french outpost in Berlin. came in at about 730 on a Saturday evening and snagged the last unreserved table. We were greeted by a cheeky waitress ready to use her English to please us. She gave wine recommendations and brought us warm bread and olives with aioli. On her recommendation I got the wild boar for my main which was excellent. My companions both ordered the duck breast which I also got to taste. Scrumptious.  What stood out about each dish was the rich but not too heavy sauces. I used some of the bread to wipe my plate. Dessert tempted is but we were too full. The waitress really made the experience. When asked about the boat dish her response was ""it not the whole boar and it's cooked, what more do you need"". She also brought us out samples of the wines to decide between. Anyone seeking an upscale meal of french comfort food should make this a destination. While you are at it, try the boar!"
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,12/21/15,"A great place for a special celebration. Food wonderful! Service knowledgeable. Oysters fresh and served with style. Waiter recommended a wine that perfectly complimented the food,  and served it correctly. All in all a sensational evening and one of my best in the Hauptstadt. Had to walk to the Geldautomat as their machine was out of service. A small price to pay."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,1,4/10/15,"Nice servic but, not very good food. The noodles with salmon and cream sauce was terrible."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,10/11/13,"Wow wow wow.  So totally in love with this place.  The service was impeccable, which if you have spent any time in Berlin you know it a rarity.  The food was varied and delicious.  The desserts were yumtastic.  All coupled with a great wine list and a really lovely romantic ambiance.  We had an amazing evening and can't recommend this highly enough."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,12/19/12,"We were here in Dez 2012 for the first time. The decoration of this place is lovely. It is cozy and we ended to stay in this place longer than we originally planned. The food was top notch. It deserves its 5 star. I would definitely go back there sooner rather than later."
Poulette,French,4,?21-40,5,7/24/09,"Splendid. Delectable food, amusing, attentive waiters. Highly recommend it."
Ristorante Pizzeria Nuova Mirabella,Italian,4,?11-20,3,6/8/17,"A pleasant venue with an extensive menu. I went for a tagliatelle with salmon in a cream sauce...and that's literally what I got. Pasta, salmon, in cream. The pasta was cooked well, and it came loaded with salmon...but it lacked any flavour.  I was disappointed and mentioned it to the waiter who immediately offered  something else. Service 4Venue 3-4Food 3Overall 3.5. I could have been unlucky, the other diners around me seemed to have much more flavoursome meals."
Ristorante Pizzeria Nuova Mirabella,Italian,4,?11-20,4,7/1/11,"A nice, cozy restaurant situated next to the Alt-Tempelhof bus stop and the Alt-Tempelhof U-Bahn station. It may look small from the outside, but it is actually quite commodious on the inside, and it also exudes a warm environment.The servers are quick to welcome guests, and they also speak English! Which is great because my German did not get me very far, but they still went ahead and tried to converse with me in German! (Good for practicing!)I had the lambrusco wine, and I am generally not a fan of wine, but this was really good! And it was a little over 4 Euros for 0,25L, not too bad. (: I also ordered the spaghetti with bacon and egg. The proportion was really good, and the price was only about 7,50 Euros. This DEFINITELY beats most Italian restaurants I have been to in California -- especially Olive Garden!!I really enjoyed my service and meal here. I may have to come back more often because it was that welcoming. (:"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/19/17,"Not super over decorated, just great authentic southern Indian food. Would recommend!"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/17/16,"I came in around 1 pm on a Wednesday and no one was available to help - it seemed like there was only one waitstaff. The restaurant was mostly empty with only one large table in the back and 2 tables outside occupied. There was no English menu.I wanted to order a chai tea but my translating app didn't find one on the menu.  I ended up trying the sweet lassi, which was not as tart as I expected it, but light and pleasant.I've never tried a dosa before (here, it's call dosia) and I loved the masala dosia I ordered! The shell was like a well-done cr?pe, crispy and light without breaking apart too easily. I tried the dosa by itself at first and it was dry, but the curry on the side helps balance it out and improve the flavor.I also ordered the saag paneer (called kyrei cheese karri), which came with basmati rice and a side salad. It was a good amount of food but the curry was unexpectedly sour.All in all, I would recommend this restaurant - order the masala dosia and a sweet lassi to go with it."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/11/17,"The food was amazing and waiters were very kind. Also really cheap.Highly recommended!"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/20/16,"ammAmma is a great restaurant if you're looking for excellent Indian food.The prices are extremely reasonable and the service is great. However, grab a beer instead of mineral water since they charge 4.9 Euros for a large bottle to satisfy two people.I'd definitely come back here. I had the #157 chicken curry dish."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,9/9/16,"When I read the reviews, I was excited to try this place out. It was an interesting indian place and the prices were fine, but they do not serve naan. This restaurant was more like an Indian fusion type place-- not so really authentic Indian food. I've had better indian around Germany, but this place is worth a go because the service is friendly and the food isn't bad."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/21/17,"My neighbourhood takeout go-to. Staff are lovely and they give you chai whilst you wait. Dishes come with rice and salad which is so nice to not have to buy separately. Generous serves, low price and tasty and spicy."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/29/16,"I liked the food, Lamp curry . It was really good. I ordered also mango shake. It was good as well.Staff is friendly and nice. Area is calm."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,2/27/17,"The food was mediocre to quite good, but we were served after 23:00 as the only customers. The waiters were friendly and the cook seemed to have fallen in love with ginger."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/12/17,Food is delicious. The parathas were spot on! Loved the curry. Will come again. Had to take a ubahn and a bus but it was worth it. Parathas are cheap so we ordered extra :)
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,4/30/17,"Friendly staff, cheap food and free mango liequer at the end! Overall a pleasant experience, but I was more impressed with the humor of the staff instead of the quality of the food."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/17/16,Absolutely amazing. Best Indian food I've ever had. Friendly staff and outstanding food. Must try if in Berlin!
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/7/15,"Loved this place, I ordered take out and got the lamb masala. Absolutely delicious. The inside is quite lovely, I imagine it would be a wonderful intimate setting for a couple or small group. They brought me delicious chai tea with milk and honey while I waited, extra points for that! This is only the second Indian place I've ever been to that does that. And I love chai :) definitely worth a stop if you're looking for good Indian food in the area!"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/12/15,"Had lunch special of a mango curry with chunks of fresh mango, and was fantastic. I was told this beforehand, and I can confirm that it does take a bit of time to get the food, but enough to let you know they are actually cooking the food a bit and not just having a single premise sauce in the back which they just add things to to make a ""new"" dish. It didn't take too long, and lunch came with a soup which was creamy, simple and delicious (I think it was a pumpkin cream soup). The service was very friendly, and the prices were cheap! Overall great spot for lunch!"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,1/17/17,"Have to be honest, not quite sure why this place is so highly reviewed. Super heavy and buttery, but if you have an aggressive case of the munchies and around 7? in your pocket then this may or may not be an amazing option."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/29/15,"We ordered a masala, paneer and chicken dosa. The food was well made but not amongst the best I've had. The host was friendly and helpful and the only reason why I'd go back. The dosas themselves were tasty but the sambar wasn't my type. The ambience is nice and somewhat quiet. Though I didn't like the Hindi music in the background. My biggest gripe with the place was the lack of backrest on the seats."
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/9/16,I've eaten here with many people over the years and we all agree that this is the best Indian food we've had in Berlin. The masala dosa is great and comes with a fantastic chutney. An extra plus for the lovely staff.
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/26/15,The ambience is good with light Tamil music in the background. The people working there were friendly for suggestions. The food was good srilankan Tamil food. Idly was fresh and coconut chi they was light and easy. Recommended for an easy night with friends.
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/15/15,"I was yelping through all kinda indian restaurant in Berlin to find a new one to try this Sunday. As I never really tried south Indian / Tamilian dishes we decided to check ammAmma out .As reading about the interior not being that special I was not surprised entering the restaurant however the very kind and welcoming waiter automatically made us feel happy and excited about our evening ahead of us.  We ordered some drinks and decided to share a mix of different starters . The waiter was really good regarding allergies and my special vegan and GF request. In the end we had the  Paruppu lentil soup, a mix vege fried platter and the Bonda fired potato  balls .As my main I ordered the Kyrei Tofu Karri which was absolutely divine, its like the Indian saag paneer just an amazing vegan alternative with the tofu option win win for myself as I just to love the paneer cheese one during my non vegan days. My mum ordered the Masala Dosai which could have been easily shared between two as we did not expect this size.  My dad and brother went for non veggie/vegan choices the vaththu Jaffna karri and mutton chilli and both said it was extremely tasty, full of flavor and perfectly cooked. If I would live in the area I defo would have found my new fave Indian take away by tonight, well one never know incase I move back this could influence my house hunting! So if you looking for an tasty and good prized Indian treat check them out and you wont be let down for sure!"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/6/15,"Wow -- dosas in Berlin!  I like this place; it is very good with service fawning over you.  I ordered the masala dosa which was very adequate (and I normally have a large appetite...)  At 7 euros I felt that it was a bargain, though I would have gladly paid more (ie. bargain food is not necessarily a first priority for me; quality is...)"
AmmAmma,Indian,4.5,Under ?10,3,11/8/15,"This place is cheap, the staff is friendly and the food is very decent. Not something to travel for, but if you are hungry and in the neighbourhood, it's most definitely a good place to get a meal."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/3/18,"Our experience here was 5 stars from start to finish.  The service was amazing, our waiter was both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu.  We had a group of 3 and all tried different items.  The gnocci was perfectly done, one of the best I have ever had (including in Italy).  The prices seemed very fair for the level of quality and service provided."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/4/17,"Went to Ristorante a Mano without reservations on a Wednesday night. They were pretty full, however we were able to snag a table for 2. After ordering drinks, another party of 4 came in and out waiter asked us if it was possible for us to move to an alternate table so they could combine two tables together to accommodate the table of 4. We had no problem doing this, and we moved. Our waiter then informed us that we could have another round of drinks on the house as a thank you! They served complimentary bread, sliced meat and the BEST OLIVES I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered a tagliatelle dish (don't remember what was in it) and I had the penne arrabbiata. Both were delicious, the arrabbiata had onions and peppers inside that added different textures to the pasta. They even served complimentary shots of limoncello or sambuca, as well as a little baggie of MyTaxi sponsored gummies (lol). Overall, I recommend this restaurant! Nice ambiance inside, extremely accommodating and kind waiters."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/1/17,"My family and I recently took a trip to Berlin. After a couple days of doner, sausages, etc., we were jonesing for some good Italian food. After cross-referencing results between Yelp and Trip Advisor, we decided on Ristorante a Mano, one of the highest-rated restaurants in the area with a ton of reviews. On the way, we were hoping that we weren't dressed too casually for the location. Upon getting there, our attire was no problem, and the waitstaff was incredibly friendly. We did not have a reservation, but that was no problem as we were immediately seated outside. I think it is accurate to say the waiters *rushed* to prepare our table. As we were seated, we promptly received bread as well as blankets to keep us warm. Our main waiter was Rosano (?), and he was very attentive, helpful, funny, and helpful. Honestly, he has set the bar for descriptions of service for my future yelp reviews. We ordered the burrata appetizer, which packed a lot of flavor. Between the four of us, we ordered a chicken/mushroom pasta, a pesto gnocchi, a truffle ravioli (!!!!!), and a spaghetti and meatballs. All were rich with bold flavors. Maybe it's because we're from a couple of college towns in Florida, but we all thought the food was superb. I have to devote a separate paragraph to the dessert. I think the general consensus among my family was that this was the best dessert we had ever had. Rosano talked us into the dessert sampler, and I wish I remembered better what exactly it consisted of. There was a moist tiramisu, a mango panna cotta, a pistachio ice cream (the best one there), and..... something else that I know was amazing but I forget what it was. Afterwards, Rosano gave us complimentary drinks and called us a cab home. Overall, this was an 11/10 experience, and I will be recommending this place to any of my friends who are lucky enough to be in Berlin."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/31/17,Was by far the most reasonable price restaurant and best tasting meal since in Germany. Waiter service was super and establishment was very clean.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/15/16,"We came here after a quick decision for good Italian food. We did not have reservations, but were given seats immediately though our group of 6 had to be split up into tables of 4 and 2 (bigger groups can be accomodated outside, but it was cold).One of the first things I noticed was how good the service was. The waiters were all very attentive. We were served bread w/olive oil and vinegar for free upon sitting down and they got our orders quickly.I shared a cream of potato soup with truffle oil, a mixed salad with a sort of balsamic vinaigrette and beef fillet, and a spaghetti with garlic, prawns, and chili. The soup was delicious, though a bit on the salty side. The salad was alright, and the pasta was really good. And apparently there was one spaghetti in my friend's sea of penne. Overall, I would say this was a solid place for Italian food and I had nothing to complain about, but it was nothing too stellar."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/7/17,I was blown away by this place. We walked in and were lucky enough to grab a table. Intimate atmosphere. Waitstaff is friendly and accommodating. Ordered buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for appetizer. I fell in love with my entree of gnocchi with truffle butter. Would not hesitate to visit today and order again. A must for homemade Italian.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,5/5/17,Great little Italian spot.. easy train ride. GREAT service. Food was very good. Maybe not great though since I wasn't a fan of The calamari. It's prob just me being ignorant American though. Calamari came whole and unbreaded which I'm. It used to. Thanks for the sambuca though at the end of dinner.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/2/17,"This restaurant was one of the culinary highlights while on a recent visit to Berlin. We tried it since it came up in a web search as the #1 highest rated/most reviewed restaurant on TripAdvisor and because of Germany's close proximity to Italy being just over the Alps. Sure enough the restaurant had an authentic Italian staff, the food was fantastic and the price was completely reasonable. A burrata appetizer, two half little carafes of red wine, a lamb chop entree and a smoked salmon lasagna entree all came in at around 70?. When we sat down at the table they brought us bread and a little spicy olive salad which tasted just like Sicilian olive salad that my grandfather used to make -- this place is a must of in Berlin. Probably best to make a reservation."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,5/22/16,"Don't come here if you're looking for Italian. The waiters are extremely rude and pretentious. I didn't order a starter and they looked at me with disgust. I brought my own bottle of water (portable branded bottle) and they asked me to keep it as if they were disgusted and forced me to order a drink. I will never recommend. Look for another place to eat dinner and have a better time in Berlin. I wish I never went."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/7/15,"Our apartment in Berlin was above this restaurant and we decided to have dinner here one night when we wanted to take it easy. We got a table easily without a booking, and they even moved us from a table in the middle of the restaurant to a more intimate table which was nice. For starter we shared the antipasti platter between us which was a nice selection of grilled vegetables, meats and cheese. We'd also been given a bowl of olives and breads so it was a nice start to the meal. For main, I had the pasta with artichoke and prawn. It was perfectly fine although I much preferred it with Parmesan which took a little while to arrive. It had a generous amount of prawns and was a really tasty dish. We shared a couple of 500ml carafes of wine between the two of us, and I think the bill was around ?60. Service was really warm and friendly, and I thought our waiter was really nice. I'm not sure I'd recommend heading out of your way to go here as it wasn't anything overly special but it was perfect for us staying so close."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/14/16,"Great Staff & Food! Highly recommended for pizza, truffles and all in between. Come here once and you'll come there often. Don't go there when you're on a diet though :) true Italian cusine as you otherwise know it only from Italy"
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/22/15,"I can highly recommend that place for all who are looking for a good Italian meal and a nice environment.We went there on my birthday during our Berlintrip. We looked for something romantic and we are both love Italian food.Our dishes were good. Not something very fancy but it tasted like you would expect it.The service was awesome. Super friendly and attentive!We will definitely visit this place again!"
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/7/15,"I'm on holiday in Berlin and was looking for somewhere nice but not too pricey for dinner. I'm very glad we chose this place! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly. They seemed to know many other customers very well, which suggests that there are regulars. I can see why! We had soups to start - both the tomato and the vegetable soups were delicious. I then had pork with porcini mushrooms and my boyfriend had steak. Both were delicious, although I did get food envy watching my boyf tuck into his wonderful steak! The wine was very tasty and we were served appetisers of bread and meats, and grapes at the end of the meal, which was a nice touch. The service was friendly and not intrusive. They would basically leave you alone until you ask them for something, at which point they can't do enough.At the end, the bill was very reasonable. We spent ?60 on two starters, two mains, wine, water, orange juice and a 20% tip. Highly recommended for very reasonably priced, good food and lovely service."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,11/23/17,"Came here yesterday for breakfast to start off a full day in Berlin. The place definitely has a European hipster vibe but I enjoyed it! Check out the interesting decorations around the restaurant. Options for breakfast were limited but delicious. They offer 3 different full breakfast options for 8.5 euro: a sweet, a cheese based and a mixed that comes with bread, muesli and an assortment of cheese and/or jam. Although it doesn't look particularly hearty, we were stuffed by the end. If you aren't as hungry they also had a la cart options like scrambled eggs.Also the server was very nice and welcoming and even gave us the lowdown on the traditional winter foods in Germany which is apparently goose, potato balls and cabbage? Hopefully we will get to try that by the end of the trip. This place is still cash only and also remember to add a 10% tip to the check."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,4,2/2/17,"Went here for lunch today. I must say the food is absolutely amazing and trully authentic. Haven't had such a nice lunch for a long time. We ordered Schnitzel with potatoes cucumber salad and ""Sch?ufle"" with fried potatoes and Sauerkraut (cabbage) two very traditional dishes. Both meals were divine and to the point. We rounded the lunch with a nice desert  up and ordered Kaiserschmarn. Wow. Regarding the service..  well.. that was the only part that was slightly disappointing because it was rather mediocre. They all seemed disinterested and that's a pity for a place with a great kitchen like this. But anyways. I can still recommend it."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,8/28/16,"This place was amazing! Quirky and cute on the corner in the very hip Mitte neighborhood. We split the pear, goat cheese, and walnut flammkuchen (thin pizza) and the on recommendation from a fellow yelper, the Geschmeltze Maultaschen mit schw?bischem Kartoffelsalat. This was basically a little pasta square layered with deliciously flavorful meat and fried, paired with a cold potato salad that was very well done. Topped our meal off with the cheesecake on special, which was presented beautifully and had a variety of toppings (raspberry, apricot, walnut) to fit your tastes.I recommend this place for its ambiance, but especially for the taste!"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,9/18/16,Cash only and worth every cent. Get that Spaetzle. It is delicious. It can easily be shared with two. It comes with a mixed green salad. That is enough for two also. I highly recommend this restating for a mouthwatering meal.
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,8/21/17,"This is my favorite German food in Berlin. Service is just  fine per Berlin standards but the atmosphere and food are excellent. If you want to enjoy an evening out, this is a great location"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,5/17/17,"Fantastic food and fantastic service. Schnitzel and flamm Kuchen were great. THe flammkuchen came loaded with bacon , bound to make anyone happy. They serve Augustiner helles, which i consider the best beer in the world, after years of trying out different beers. So they get extra points for that."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,4,10/3/17,"Cool place to go for a Swabian dinner. It's a good place to go to try something different from the normal German cuisine you find in Berlin. Our dinner group had maultaschen, flammkuchen, and a pork plate. All were very good and we finished with a dessert I highly recommend - Kaiserschmarrn. Nice berlin style ambience - clean but not a white table cloths type of place"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,4,10/22/16,"Very cute restaurant, good service, many German specialties. It trends heavily towards items with meat, but there are several vegetarian options. I had the maultaschen, a stuffed pasta with meat and caramelized onions, and my friend had an egg dish that she liked quite a lot. Atmosphere was good. I would totally come back again."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,3,4/2/17,"Nothing bad, but nothing special. We did the standard thing and searched various apps to identify options for dinner on the first night in Berlin. Schwarzwaldstudben is in a good area with lots of backup options if full/closed or not to your taste. The staff were good, the menu is traditional German  (soup was very nice, mains were average) and the food ... average? Basically, I was trying to find something spectacular  and we got something that was.....good. So, it's nice, it's cheap you won't be upset, but you won't be blown away either."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,1/18/16,"Very nice place with a really cozy feel to it and friendly staff. The food is very good as well! I had the spaetzle with cheese which came with a small side salad , and it was delicious, huge portion too! I couldn't even finish it! We also had a flammkuchen with bacon and onions to share and let me tell you, you absolutely have to get one, especially if you have never tried them! It was amazing! The staff is very attentive and they even helped me to choose a beer. The place has a black forest theme so there are antlers hanging on the walls, a coal stove in the middle of the room and the dark, wooden tables finish it off.Very nice meal for a very decent price and even tried a new snapps flavor!! ( marille, try it you will like it! ;) ) Also, I was so full I couldn't try the dessert but please have a Kaiserschmarrn and tell me how it is!!"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,4,7/19/15,"So glad we stopped here for brunch! Super authentic German food, with many locals eating here.I had the vorspeisenteller plate: like a plate full of different bites and things to try. Was super happy with my selection.No worries if dishes are in German, they have description in English of what's in the dish :)"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,2,5/14/16,"Unimaginative German food, very average service - but actually in a pretty good vibe establishment.Located in the happening Mitte part of Berlin, this place came up as no.4 on Yelp, but I am still scratching my head as to why?Reception was really slow, but warmed up a little with some pretty crappy attempts at German on my part.Pretty busy and a good crowd of patrons for an early dinner in an environment that is cosy, not too loud with some eclectic decor.Food was slow and bland, went for the German pizza starter on recommendation which was okay but I'll be tasting the onion for days. Roasted Beef was way overcooked, tough and served with sp?tzle and snow peas in a gravy sauce (yay...).Maybe this place has a better breakfast - but I doubt I will try, there are so many better options in Berlin.As a social hangout, I think this place rocks. If you want to eat some good food, there are better options around."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,12/22/14,"We went to a lot of restaurants in Berlin, but this was hands down one of my favorite ones. It was better than the Michelin star restaurants. We accidentally stumbled into here after a day of walking. To be honest, i can't even tell you what we had & with correct spelling.Get the fried pizza, the schnitzel, the cheese plate... all worth it."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,1/10/15,"While in Berlin one must eat German food right? Well we went here and it was sooo great!!! Not only was the food authentic and filling, the atmosphere was very relaxed and the decorum was unique! Before this trip I never ate German food but if all German food tasted as good as this places I'd definitely eat it again and again! Service was great. Had an English version which was super helpful. All of the staff was super friendly and gave great recommendations! If you're in Berlin I suggest eating here!"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,9/16/16,Great schnitzel and salad. Lovely beers and choice place to people watch if you sit outside. No credit cards accepted so bring cash.
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,5/6/15,"Love love loved it...We found this restaurant on Yelp and were very impressed with the reviews so we decided to check it out for lunch. The place has a very nice and cozy atmosphere, gets lots of light, and has a hip and casual d?cor. We sat at the bar, most tables were taken. There were a lot of tourists there, but surprisingly, the place did not feel too touristy!!We ordered the pork schnitzel and the lentil with spaetzle and sausage. Absolutely delicious. Pair that with a great service and  we were very happy with our experience. So happy that we came back the next morning for breakfast and we were oh so glad that we did. For 8 you get a large plate with a delicious oatmeal, an egg, some ham and salami, and fruit, if not more. The coffee is very good too. With the check, they bring you a lovely postcard of one of the paintings on their wall. A very sweet memento..."
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,2,8/10/16,The food was really good (especially the tomato soup) but our server was rude and the glassware was dirty.
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,7/16/15,We came here for breakfast and loved this place. What's better than getting an extremely delicious meal for breakfast with a beer. You have to order the Konig Ludwig pale ale. They have it on draught and it is really crisp and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I wish I could go to this place regularly.
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,7/6/16,"Yum!Taste 5Price 5Service 5I was very happy and will definitely come back. Such a gem!"
Schwarzwaldstuben,Breakfast & Brunch,4,?11-20,5,9/3/13,"Excellent spot for German food. The spatzle is particularly amazing here.I recommend the schnitzel here as well -- very moist and flavorful. The fried potatoes it comes with are excellent too. The sausages with spatzle and lentil beans is also great. The side salad is a very generous portion and extremely tasty.The decor is very hipster. It has a lot of charm. The waiters speak English (and there's an English menu) plus they are super friendly!"
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/15/15,"Handmade pasta was so good!We had fresh made cheesecake which was amazing!People working here are very nice and very friendly :)"
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,4/15/17,"This place is really a kids friendly place with fine selection of pizza and pasta. We asked the waiter to divide a pasta and a pizza on three plates, and no problems here at all. So five stars for that. We got a very greasy meat dish and an overcooked fish as main course, and combined with a poor wine card they get 3 stars. Remember to bring cash as the nearest ATM is quite far away."
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/20/16,One of our favorite little Italien restaurants. We enjoy the food as well as the great staff. I can recommend a visit anytime. The pizza and pasta are really good.
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/11/11,"- i came to this place on a tip that the people here are fantastic. aside from that being true, i can not even describe the tantalizing ways of the italian food. i just arrived from croatia where i thought the general food was second to none, and now i have found a restaurant where the food here is beyond the german standard itself and the pizza annihilates its croatian and italian competitors. the process from when you sit until the time you leave gives you a very warm and smooth feeling. bread with balsamico, olive oil and some chillis to your liking or if you must a salad or anti pasta to start, then your main course can go from a variety of Salmon dishes/pastas/pizzas/steaks with home grown spices and herbs, dessert(if you can manage after your meal) and a coffee or tea to finish. perfect. 5 stars + another 5 :)"
A Telha,Portuguese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/4/16,Real Portugal in Germany! Super tasty food mega big portions . Fast and friendly crew
A Telha,Portuguese,4.5,?11-20,4,8/23/13,"My companions and I were here tonight for dinner. As we were a big group, we booked a table, and they seated us at the corner of the very nicely-decorated restaurant. We had a reservation for 9 people at 7:00 PM, and it was accommodated nicely.About 20 minutes later, our orders were taken, both drinks and meals. I ordered the Surprise platter; as it was a Portuguese tapas restaurant, I figured it would be a great idea to sample many things at once. So for 12,90 EUR, I got a surprise platter containing 5 different kinds of tapas.The flavors mostly centered on the salty kind. That however was not a big deal, as I had this idea that Portugal relies a lot on the sea for its cuisine. There was a sausage, a fish, a vegetable, a meat, and a shrimp tapas in my platter. They also served bread and olives, together with mayonnaise, and the mayonnaise was just plain heaven in my opinion. The only thing preventing me from giving this place a full 5 stars is the waiting time. We waited a full hour (maybe more) for our food to come out. And ironically, the last plate to come out was a cheese plate; as far as I can tell, it didn't need any cooking, just slicing the cheese and the meat. That being said, I know that we were a group of 9, and so if we were just a little bit smaller, then perhaps the wait time wouldn't be that bad. In short, I would come back here again. Since I live just two buildings away, there's no reason not to. Now I know why I see so many people eating here every time I pass by."
A Telha,Portuguese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/11/17,"Great place, very original. Feels like you are on vacation in Portugal. Food Quality is very good and has a home-style quality. Service is kind and generous with olives and aioli with bread as a welcoming starter. House wine is good too. Demands for extra wishes were kindly accomodated."
A Telha,Portuguese,4.5,?11-20,3,8/26/13,"It is an honest proposition at a fair price. Got the Surprise Tapas plate and can't say I'm disappointed.Next time I would go for either the main dishes like Entrecot at the tile (Telha) (or some similar plates) or the Bacalhau (Cod) treats.Waiting times may be a bit on the long side, however."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,2/8/16,"We went here last night. The place is cozy, a lot of tables in a little space. We were given some sherry right at the start, which is nice. Ordered a potato appetizer that came with two sauces, and they were good. We had paella for dinner. It was good, not amazing, but the best we have had so far in Berlin. I got one drink and it was fairly week, so for the price I would get a beer next time.All in all it was decent, I give it four stars, but would have liked to give it 3 1/2. Next time we want paella we will probably try somewhere new, but this will be a nice fallback option for sure."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,3,9/27/17,"The food was amazing: authentic, tasty, big portions, not pricy at all. On the other hand the service was VERY rude to us. And not only once. I personally had a very mixed feeling leaving this place."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,9/1/16,"Genuine Spanish restaurant (I'm spanish). We had octopus, sardines, croquetas and ham and everything was good. Traditional and charming 80s decoration and friendly staff."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,5/14/15,"It's just one of the best Spanish restaurants I've ever been to. I've been several times in Spain; however, mostly in touristic areas and food I tasted wasn't quite authentic probably. I received advise to try this restaurant from one of my Spanish friends, and this evening changed my mind about Spanish food. If you are in Berlin and love good authentic Spanish food, this is the place to go to."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,8/7/14,"This is a very typical spanish restaurant.Good atmoshere ,good food .The tapas are a little bit expensive (for students)but very good.you have to make a reservation because it's always full."
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,4/10/13,"Sitze hier gerade und habe super leckeren Fisch gegessen und hausgemachten Sangria getrunken! Die Stimmung ist super, obwohl auf allen Fernsehern Fussball l?uft Spanische Live Musik gut gelauntes Personal. Ein tolles Restaurant"
El Borriquito,Spanish,4,?11-20,4,8/28/11,"cool location, great food, hard to find a place."
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/7/18,"This was our favorite restaurant in Berlin. They have a good mixture of world flavors. They start you off with different breads and butters, which were all delectable. I had the Veal and my fianc? had the tagliatelle. The Banoffi Pie was an amazing dessert. Get a reservation because this place is happening."
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/2/16,"I was surprised by all the hype, but DAMN was that vegan platter good!! And the bread with butter. And the p?o de queijo. And the bits I stole from my friends' plates. It is a little costlier than the normal ??-place, though. Also, book ahead."
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/9/16,"Try the Vegan Plate - it' soo delicious. Even my dad, who's not even vegetarian, always has it. Butterhandlung is my favourite restaurant in Berlin."
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,11/15/15,"The best restaurant in Berlin, it's a hidden gem! High quality food with a super diverse menu, great drinks and by far the best service I could get in this town! They also have a cocktail bar in a back room that plays great live music!"
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/2/15,"Delicious! A cute spot with great outdoor seating, very close to the S-bahn and U-bahn. Great wine and great food, very friendly servers. Like others mentioned there are no English menus, but the servers more than happily translated for us (and otherwise spoke English). We were all happy with our food and drinks!"
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,12/2/15,"Butterhandlung is my friend's (an unabashed foodie) favorite restaurant in Berlin, so he took me there on my last visit to Berlin. After you take seat in Butterhandlung the waiter serves some fresh cubes of flavored butters with a variety of freshly-baked breads. Both of our starters were chosen from the standard menu. We had two starters; scallops with mango and avocado cream, yaki-nori and wasabi foam, and an arugula plate with vanilla-bourbon-shrimps and goat cheese rolls with maracuja dressing. Both were very well garnished and prepared to perfection. To the starter we had a red wine and the 2014 Riesling (B?rgermeister Schweinhardt (Nahe), which we continued drinking for the main course. We then had two meals from the daily specials menu. One meal was a freshly made green spaghetti with a red sauce and a burrata so fresh it all but melted on top of the spaghetti noodles. The other meal featured a pristine cobia filet with lemon risotto, lemon foam and cooked diced onions. Again, the main course was brilliant in flavor, texture and presentation. After our commendations to the chef and kitchen staff, the waiter served us a shot of delicious cacha?a.  The restaurant boasted a wonderful atmosphere and it was clear that the staff was mutually invested in preparing  exquisite recipes and taking care of their restaurant patrons. Needless to say, we both had a fantastic evening and will definitely come back. Amazing work, Butterhandlung!"
Butterhandlung,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/4/14,"I've been to Butterhandlung twice now, and I will keep coming back while I've got the opportunity!The ambiance is cosy and it's not another culinary tourist trap like several other restaurants in Friedrichshain.The staff are very accommodating and even help translate the menu into english for me (due to my limited German).The prices are fair, but in all honesty, it's really cheap considering the quality of the meal!The location is very convenient for me as I also live on Scharnweberstr.I have had the same meal twice now, which is Pork fillet with white asparagus. The pork was cooked medium, and melted in the mouth. As for the 'Spargelzeit', it needs no further introduction - Amazing.I would prefer to keep this restaurant to myself and not advertise to the masses, but I would be doing such a great restaurant injustice.If you're looking for a great meal and have some time to unwind while in Friedrichshain, get to Butterhandlung for a dining experience you'll remember for all the right reasons."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,8/2/17,"This is our 3rd time here. Food always excellent. Served with FRESH HOt bread with a slight crisp to it. Great wine selections by the glass and bottle. Tonight, we started with the Caesar salad. A must if you like Caesar fresh made croutons as well. Entres, Handmade tortellini stuffed with braised short ribs, and  creamy white sauce, perfect al dente. Hubby had smocked salmon stuffed ravioli with shrimp and cherry tomatoes, very tasty. Had to skip dessert, as we are stuffed. They don't scrimp. Our server Chris brought us a tiny treat anyway. They serve espresso, but we are going up the street to  Piccola Trattoria  for an espresso, so Luca doesn't feel bad we've been cheating on him over here  at Osteria Caruso.BTW the deco in here is  a major improvement. Service is always spot on, well attended, and food served HOT."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,4,8/4/16,"Lovely Italian restaurant. We ordered Minestrone, carbonara and the mushroom ravioli. My order of pasta Carbonara was not like the one I a used to. Egg yolks were fluffy and not incorporated, usually it happens when eggs were added to the hot dish without tempering. Pasta was al dente.Mushroom Raviolli was my favorite. They do charge 2,50 euro for the tap water. It's unisual for me.Also service was very Italian - slow, and not really paying attention to us. Had to ask for the bill three times. And it's the worst, you know? When you are ready leave but stuck at the table. Tiramisu had way to much sponge and not enough cream filling. We were compensating it with the side whipped cream."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,7/16/17,"Well cooked. Home made. Delicious. Great service. Found this local gem through Yelp. I had the house specialty tortello with basil pesto. It was well cooked and absolutely delicious; not too heavy as I sometimes find pasta dishes to be. The pesto too was really well balanced; No garlic taste overshadowing the taste of basil. For dessert I had their home made tiramisu. I'm not lying when I say it was the best tiramisu I've ever had! It was light, fluffy and well balanced - I could've kept eating the entire pan! Although I would DEFINITELY recommend the Tiramisu, I'd also recommend trying their wine foam  (made from masala liqueur and egg whites) w vanilla ice cream - I've never tasted anything like it! The foam is a bit warm as it is heated to create the foam - along with the cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce sprinkled on the sides of the glass, it makes for at perfectly light and delicious dessert!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,2,1/28/17,"A total flop. The food was delicious but the service was astoundingly bad.We were seated at 19:15, and at first it went well. We put in our order within ~10 minutes, and the appetizer was out in another 10. Then came the wait. The long, slow, agonizing wait. Our entrees arrived at 20:30 -- a full HOUR after we had ordered them. Someone had clearly forgotten us, because in the meantime a couple had been seated next to us, ordered, and had their food come out while we were still waiting on ours. When the waiter finally brought us our food, it had been sitting out for a while. The plate and edges of the food were cold. I hoped the waiter would have noticed his mistake, but that was too optimistic. We shrugged it off and enjoyed the dinner -- the food was actually pretty good (the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1). But it didn't take long for the bad service to return. We ordered dessert and coffee, and it's another half hour wait. 30 minutes for a cup of coffee? C'mon. Finally we ask to pay, and you can guess what happened. We watched in astonishment over the next 15 minutes as our server gave literally everyone else in the restaurant their checks without giving us ours. We were now the last people there, and I had already stood up and put on my coat. It was like something out of a British comedy or prank show -- ""How long will they wait around to pay while the restaurant closes? Find out after these commercials!""I was about to walk out, figuring that if they really want my money they'll suddenly give us the check we asked for, but my wife insisted we ask again. ?85 for this fiasco. We walked out of the place at 22:00, nearly 3 hours after starting. I like to eat a slow dinner, but that's ridiculous. (And it wasn't a cultural difference -- I understand that in Germany, waiters leave you alone until you call them. At every turn our requests were explicitly ignored or forgotten.)Ever since I moved here, I've known Berlin as a world-class city with many fantastic food options. For Italian alone there are a number of other places who's food is just as good and whose service is not embarrassingly slow. I suggest you take your business to one of them."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,4,7/2/17,"A bit overpriced, but worth it as the food was delicious and pleasant service. Come on an empty  stomach, as the portions are quite large!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,3/20/16,"WARNING: The portions of food are huge at Osteria Caruso. I ordered the minestrone soup as an appetizer, but it really could have been my main course. As my actual main course, I enjoyed a PENNE ALL'ARRABBIATA, spicy in all the right ways. Knowing how large the servings are, you really get the bang out of your buck in this Italian joint. The waitress was a true Italian and very friendly. A perfect place for a lunch or restaurant date with friends."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,11/7/15,"Gorgeous! Friendly and helpful wait staff, delicious and we'll prepared dishes, and a free shot of limoncello; a perfect evening."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,5/28/14,"Absolutely great experience! Atmosphere made me feel like I was in Italy again.  Food was great, service was awesome.  Server was owners son & couldn't have been more friendly, personable & helpful.  English, Italian & German languages, no problem.We all shared a bresaola salad, a caprese salad, 3 pasta dishes & 2 desserts.  I forgot I was in Berlin.We are a flight crew in private aviation & travel the world, so we know a totally great experience when we go to a great restaurant.  (I'm a true foodie!) Definitely a treat in Germany when you get tired of bier & weiner schnitzel!  (Not that there's anything wrong with that)!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,1/17/16,"Wonderful hardly describes this restaurant. Everything about it was great. Off the beaten path, away from the tourist traps, reasonable prices, good portion sizes, fresh ingredients, friendly and patient staff. Very popular with locals. Parking on the street is tough but it is located about 2 blocks from Potsdamer Platz metro station. Great traditional dishes from all regions of Italy. My wife and I liked it so much we went back the next night. We tried soups, pizza, beef and pasta dishes; all were as good or better than any of the touristy spots you'll find in Berlin. Reservations are strongly recommended. This place is so warm and inviting it's like your having dinner at a relative's house. If I'm ever back in Berlin, I will certainly go again."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,6/28/15,"Wonderful experience! The food was delicious and the service was excellent.   We had the Pecorino salad, spaghetti alla carbonara and homemade ravioli and they did not disappoint.  If you are looking for great Italian food and great service, definitely try this place out!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,3/16/16,My husband is both Italian and a chef.  I consider myself a good judge of Italian food.  This place is FANTASTIC!!!!
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,3,2/1/15,"Decent pizza and nice homey ambiance,  good option near potsdamer platz. Lots of families."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,3,4/30/12,My second time at this restaurant. A family friendly and realistic decorated place. The prices are ok and the service is as expected. But if you look for a very good italian pizza you should look somewhere else. The pasta is good though and they have a nice selection of wines.
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,8/19/15,"Awesome place near Potzdamer platz. Great atmosphere, excellent food. Service was really friendly. Our family had appetizers, pasta, pizza and steak, all were very good! A must try!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4,?11-20,5,6/28/15,Had an wonderful dinner.  Me and my girlfriend were truly wowed by everything from the antipasto to the entrees and also the wine.
Bellas Artes,Spanish,4,?11-20,2,12/30/16,"We ordered the Tapas para dos--actually they made it tapas para tres--a varied selection of what I assume were the best tapas the restaurant has. There were two rounds: first six (again, we were three) cold tapas, and then six hot tapas. None of them were exceptional.The service was really the worst part though. The waiters were totally inattentive and impossible to find. When called over directly, they had no choice to come over, but it was clear that they were too busy for us. I'd recommend somewhere else!"
Bellas Artes,Spanish,4,?11-20,1,1/11/16,"Worst service in Berlin! Waiters who don't pay attention at all. So be prepared to wait a lot.Since they don't take visa I had to walk for 45 minutes to find an ATM and in the meantime they refused to serve my friends who tried to order two more beers until we had paid our bill.. Luckily the girl who worked there went above her rude colleagues and served them anyway. No apologies for bad service/rude behavior, in fact the guy I paid didn't say a single word to me.. The tapas is okay to good, but with an attitude like that there is certainly 6 people who will never return."
Bellas Artes,Spanish,4,?11-20,3,4/21/14,"We visited Bellas Artes for dinner on a recent trip to Berlin. I rarely go for Spanish food because being from Spain, Spanish restaurant food is always a little disappointing. This was not an exception. The food was VERY salty. We ordered Jamon Serrano pata negra but they told us they didn't have it. The garlic chicken was good but not authentic Spanish style. Overall we had a lot of fun, maybe the 1/2 liter Rioja carafe helped. The waiter was from Peru and really nice so the service was good. Wish the tapas were more authentic flavors."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,8/21/17,"One of my favorite hidden gems of a cafe in a typically crappy part of Mitte (not actually crappy, but a working district near touristy areas where there aren't many good cafes and restaurants per my standards, I mean). I worked in that neighborhood and went daily to Flamingo. They have great selection of drinks and a nice hot breakfast option. The owner or manager is always running around greeting people. Nice guy. Recommended!A few additional thoughts now that I have a bit more time:  They were remodeling when I moved back to the US in August 2017, so I'm not sure how things look now (I don't know why they were remodeling - it was so cute before; hopefully no big changes). With that said:Pros:Ambience -- beautiful, airy cafe with clean modern design. It doesn't have a great view of the Spree or anything, but it is nice inside. It is the perfect spot to meet a friend for wine, stop in for breakfast or read a book in the afternoon during a lunch break.  I met all my tandem language partners there because it was sufficiently central in the city, safe and offered both coffee and wine.Food -- they have a selection of the typical German sandwiches (these are usually a crunchy sourdough roll with a combination of fresh cheese, tomato and cold cuts), muffins, cakes, cookies and, as I mentioned above, an American-ish breakfast option (scrambled eggs with a side option - I got avocado - and bread).  For those of you who don't speak German, this isn't on the menu above the counter, but rather on a specials-style small board sitting on the counter.  I always came for that breakfast, as it reminded me of home with a European twist. It was excellent.Mixed:Service --  If this is your first time in Germany, remember that expectations for ""friendly service"" are bare to nonexistent here (also because tips are lower than in the US).  I would say that Flamingo service was fine to good by German standards, but they're not trying to win any awards in that department.  I always got the sense that every customer was an annoyance to the service staff, but that is typical overall in Germany and Europe.  By contrast, the owner is very friendly and made me quite welcome.  One time I dropped my shortbread tea cookie (the cookie that comes on the side of tea in Europe) on the ground and he noticed and came over with a replacement. He was always chatting with people and also keeping staff in line. I think their food and service is better because he is there to keep an eye on things."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,11/22/17,Good location - good food. Centrally located near the friedrichstra?e station. Got a roast beef sandwich and Brussel sprout cheddar soup. Got there after the lunch rush so limited options on the sandwhiches.
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,3,10/28/16,"A pleasant self-service bistro with quite nice food. The atmosphere is nice and the food is of a good quality, however, nothing special. The service is a bit slow and not very professional. If you want to sit by a clean table, you better clean it up yourself because wiring for it to be cleaned may take ages...."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,2,7/29/16,"I arrived here with high hopes having read the reviews but my pasta dish was ridiculously salty. They'd over seasoned it then added capers and pesto on top, so it was salt overkill and I couldn't finish it. The coffee was pretty good. My friend had a salmon sandwich and loved it so I think it was just my dish on this particular occasion.  The place itself is lovely, open plan and breezy with an option of outdoor seating. Very 'hip and happening' and not far from museum island."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/15,"**FAVORITE LUNCH SPOT IN BERLIN**The moment I stepped in, I knew.This WAS the place for me.AMBIANCE=========Lots of light and good energy.Pastels and white.There is a pink dining table. YES.FOOD=====PEA WITH MINT SOUPProbably the best pea soup I've ever had.Super fresh, chunky, with no flour or cornstarch.RATING: 5/5STRAWBERRY VANILLA MARIZAPANWow, my favorite pastry in Berlin so far.Fluffy, flavorful, and tasted all natural.RATING: 5/5OVERALL=========Prices were reasonable, service was friendly (I'm shocked, really).Definitely worthy of another return.Want to try their fruit milkshakes next time.And probably eat all of the desserts on the menu.HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,4/7/17,"Amazing lunch spot for soups and sandwiches. It was a short walk for us from Museum Island, and it gave a nice break in between. I ordered the Parmesan sandwich with sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, and special sauce. Bread was crunchy and fresh. It was really tasty. Friends ordered lentil soup and chicken Caesar sandwich. Everyone enjoyed!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,9/5/17,"This was a perfect spot for lunch. It is off the main boulevard, but worth the walk.  There was a long line to order,but Isn't that a sign of a good place? The food was Delicious and reasonable.  I had the chicken curry and it was fabulous and large enough to split! The people working here were friendly and helped me with the all German menu that was on the board.  I would highly recommend."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,6/30/16,The breakfast is not bad. The staff is pretty nice and friendly. Price is reasonable. I would recommend this place for a good start of day?
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,7/29/15,"This place has nice decor, something like out of a tea party as my girlfriend would say. We stopped by for a light snack; she got a chai latte and apfelstrudel, and I got a cappuccino and roast beef sandwich (yes.. a snack).If you eat in, they'll heat up the sandwich and bring it to you. The staff regularly checked up on us to see if we were enjoying the food, in a non-imposing way, and we thought that was really nice of them.If nothing else get the chai latte.. oh my that tiger spice chai.."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,12/10/15,"This is my 'go to' place in central Berlin when I want guaranteed tasty, healthy and easy. Their offering of daily changing house-made soups are without fail a superb offering. The interior is light, bright and, sometimes, bustling. It is clean, convenient and friendly- with great fresh food. What's not to love?!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,8/11/16,"This restaurant in Berlin has awesome soups everyday. It gets super busy around lunch time. Come around 11AM to have their soups! I tried a potato soup with meat in it, which was what made me want to come back. Vegetable soup was also good, but not too unique. They also have fruity soups (not my favorite - there was a tart banana and avocado one)."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,5/26/15,"This was my favorite meal in Berlin. Everything is fresh, local, and deliciously healthy. I had the carrot asparagus soup with the tomato mozzarella panini, which they grilled for me. My husband also had the soup and a house salad with the carrot juice. The soup was unique, but tasty with large chunks of asparagus. The sandwich was fresh and just what I needed. The place was very busy with locals, which is always a good sign. The service was very helpful and patient with my lack of German. I wish I could go there today!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,11/2/16,"Delicious lunch spot in Berlin! Great sandwiches made with fresh bread, delicious soups, and friendly service. Good prices and great selection for a quick lunch break. Will definitely return!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,7/17/15,Stumbled upon this place from a yelp recommendation while visiting Berlin.   Low key super fresh homemade food - was probably the best cucumber soup I ever had and the red wine was pretty good as well.   Plus free wifi - great place for lunch!!!
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,8/25/15,"Friendly staff, free wifi, clean bathroom, good food.  Recommended if you're in the area.  Everything is pre made and on display, so while not made to order, it all tastes very fresh."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,1/13/16,"Yum! Great homemade and fresh soups and salads! The feldsalat is not the cleanest, I have to admit, for sometimes I have gotten gritty pieces. The dressing trumps that and I eat it anyway. They create good pumpkin everything! A bit pricey for lunch specials, but delicious. The biggest issue is lack of seating. Serious issue that needs attention. It's small inside and always has a line. Thank goodness for take away!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,10/7/15,"Friendly staff, tasty salad, nice ambience to just chill for a bit. Great to find a place near to many of the main sights that isn't too touristy and serves healthy food. I will definitely be returning!"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,4/19/14,"We went there on an afternoon so we couldn't get the chance to taste their meal of the day, sadly. However, we tried a double chocolate brownie and their cheesecake, and they were quite good! I expected the brownie to be too ""chocolated"" but it ended up being the perfect mix, providing me with melting bites! What a sweet surprise :)"
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,4/15/13,"Okay I only had a chai tea latte (pictured) but as far as decoration, location, and that chai tea latte go, it was great. It's near Humboldt University and the Friedrichstra?e station so that's a plus, and I'm a bit of a sucker for the cute blue/flowery/lighthearted theme they had going on. I saw other people eating sandwiches and soups and so I might go back and try that sometime.Edit! I came back today and tried a Mozzerella and tomato sandwich plus chai tea latte again. The sandwich was good and again the service was quick. Sandwich plus chai tea latte cost 5.80 Euro."
Flamingo Fresh Food Bar,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,9/3/12,"This cafe, located a bit offside Friedrichstr, is just great. When you enter this modern, hip and friendly place you do feel welcome. They don't have an english menu BUT they do have wonderful friendly staff who can explain everything for you! Even ordering a flatwhite wasn't a problem. They show their sandwiches in a big glass cabinet, so easy!We had breakfast there, they heated our sandwiches which made the bread wonderful cross and the cheese just perfectly soft. I've heard it's terrible crowded during lunch time when they serve one main dish a day and 3 different types of soup. We might go there anyway and try it. The salads we saw looked great, I like the way you pick small containers with different stuff you want on your salad, and they do have a big variety to choose from. That makes it easy to just buy to to take with you for later or to pre buy before lunch time!WiFi is free and has good speed."
Tapas Nr. 6,Tapas/Small Plates,4.5,?11-20,5,1/31/15,"a real discovery, delicious food, excellent wine and cozy atmosphere, the only critical point is that is not on a main street and you wouldn't find it if you are not looking for it, but this is also a plus if you are looking for a more cozy and less touristic spot."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/5/17,"Awesome schnitzel!! Definitely add the eggsGreat atmosphere Staff very friendly Price was brilliant"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/6/18,"This was my first official meal in Berlin, and it seemed very authentic!Service: I was seated right away, and the waiter was extremely friendly and always cracking jokes with the other patrons. No complaints here!Food: I ordered a Pilsner with the pork schnitzel, which came with two fried eggs and potatoes. I was very pleased with the food as it had a lot of flavor and it filled me up. The Pilsner was around ?3.50 and the schnitzel was around ?9.90.Everything was very affordable and the meal definitely wasn't gourmet in any aspect, but if you are looking a quick and delicious German meal, come here!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/4/17,"My favorite place! I don't know better place in Berlin to get real German homemade food! Prices are low, service is different from other restaurants in Berlin - friendly, interior is... well let's call it charming"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/10/17,"Reasonably priced, traditional German food. I ate the rissoles and also the Schnizel. The rissoles was ""ok"" but the schnizel was pretty good, not dry like the other ones that I've tried."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,1,9/28/17,"The waiter refused to seat us at this place so we didn't even get to try anything. It was super busy but there were a few spaces open and we asked twice and were still turned away. I'm disappointed because I was really excited to try German food and this place has great reviews, but I guess I will have to go somewhere else."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/20/17,"Nice German eatery. Not many options on the menu, and not fancy food items at all, but good for what it is. Staff is attentive even though they are really busy."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/15/17,Very traditional. Very simple. You can order anything here and it will be delicious. The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. This tucked away gem should be your go to for affordable comfort food.
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/12/17,"Small place with old world character. Outstanding food. Schnitzel was great as well as the meatballs. Fried potatoes were on the spot. Service was friendly, fast and attentive. A must try if you want quality, authentic German food. Highly recommend."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/28/17,I spent a weekend in Berlin and decided to eat here because I wanted to try German food. The place itself looks like a little pub and I can tell the food is authentic. German food isn't something I would crave but it's good! The waiters were nice and the prices were very affordable b
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/18/17,"Same as a lot of other places in Paris. Expensive and not worth the price. But, it's decent food in a good spot. You won't be missing out if you ate in instead"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/11/17,"Came with 2 toddlers and it was quick and simple.  No fuss, quality food, quick service (albeit we arrived at 18h30).  We don't speak German, but menu was only one page."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/17/16,"Words can not express, but I'll do my best: the beer was clean, the food was fresh and flavorful, and the owner was friendly, playful and funny. My brother and I has a great late dinner at 10:30pm on a Sunday. Can't beat that! We agreed that we will certainly return whenever possible."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/5/16,"Comfort food done excellent! They do not have an extensive menu but what they do they do well. I had the Risolles which is like the meatball meatloaf and though this cuisine is not know for its range of flavor profile, the food was delicious and presented well. The potatoes came cooked perfect with crispy outsides, the presentation was spot on and I saw other people's open sandwiches which look spectacular! Shame I ""stumbled upon this by accident based on Yelp reviews"" on my last night. Get here early in the trip as you might want to come back!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/30/16,"We wanted authentic German food and our desires were met! The place is small, but feels cozy. I got the pork that tasted okay, but my friends got the other meat, which I preferred more. Overall, it was a heavy meal with beer and an experience for those seeking authentic German food!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/2/15,"Small and cozy bar/restaurant with huge portions of really good food at prices you really can't beat. They have two menus (German and English), but the server only understood German so there was still a little bit of confusion about our order. (Shout out and thanks to the friendly people who shared our communal table and translated for us!) Everything on the menu is 10euro or less! The menu is somewhat similar (slight variations and combinations of different meats, number of eggs, etc.), so maybe not the best place to go if you're a vegetarian. I had the dish with 2 rissoles (a cross between a meatball and patty? nonetheless very good), 2 over easy eggs, potatoes, pickles and peppers. Super tasty and hearty, I couldn't even finish!Only downside: There was only one server and the place was pretty packed around 9:30PM (Saturday night though), so we ended up waiting almost 30min before the server even took our order. At least the food didn't take that long to come out.So if you're not in a time crunch and want some authentic German food, I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/24/16,"Simple menu. 1 page of items but the two popular being schnitzel and meatballs. Not huge but again great beer selection. I had the schnitzel and it was really good. Tender and tasty. Came with potatoes and additions.I will definitelly be back for some more"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/3/17,"This place is heaven. Delicious food, delicious beer, good service. Appears to be mostly locals. The schnitzel is amazing. We broke our ""dont dine at the same place twice"" rule while visiting to come back for the schnitzel again."
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/30/17,"Off the beaten track.  We found this place via Yelp.  Lots of good reviews.  Place lived up to the hype.  Down home informal setting with friendly staff, great food, affordable prices, and rustic down-home ambiance.  Delightful experience!!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/24/16,"There aren't a whole lot of options at this bar/restaurant, but it doesn't matter because what you get is going to be excellent. I got the breaded pork and my husband got the meat ball-type dish. We took a bite and knew we picked the right place for dinner! It's authentic, it's crowded, it's a little loud, but it's awesome. We will go back when we're in Berlin!You can grab a beer or wine (beer being the preferred drink here). The menu is in German and English, so no worries there. The staff is friendly and was helpful. The pork dish came with what Americans would consider home fries, some slaw (I think) and a delicious pickle. The meat balls are nice and filling and you can get it with an egg...I think it's a local thing! Seriously though, there's no reason NOT to go here. Oh, and bring cash!"
Stadtklause,German,4.5,Under ?10,3,12/21/15,"Make no mistake, the food here is cheap, which I think is a large part of its allure.It's straightforward and very filling, but neither quality nor food are particularly exemplary. Salad includes portions of the lettuce head, for example. Dirt cheap potato and bean soup was a massive bowl but incredibly salty.Nice pub vibe and a nice place for a more intimate, local feel to it.Service falls into category of ""surly German,"" and I'm not quite sure if it's normal to be surly or if they were just unwelcoming since we didn't speak German except ""please"" and ""thank you.""3.5 for the vibes and food, but a 3 since I didn't feel welcome here..."
La Muse Gueule,French,4,?11-20,5,12/11/11,"One of my favorite French locals. They have a delicious quiche and almost always a yummy couscous. Apparently the duck is good too if you are a meat eater. The bartenders are always helpful in wine recommendations, there is a nice dark bloody red that I could drink by the bottle!"
La Muse Gueule,French,4,?11-20,3,10/11/15,"Really simple menu, almost like French Tapas kind of place. Had the duck (one of the few appetizers) and it was pretty good, but not amazing. Cool atmosphere, but again nothing amazing. Would probably seek out a more full meal French place first before returning."
La Muse Gueule,French,4,?11-20,4,9/14/13,"Very nice place with good food. The service (or the kitchen) is a little slow, and in typical French Cuisine tradition, meals are not very substantial. Come here for a feast of flavor and tastes, not if you are starving.The desserts (especially the mousse au chocolat) is to die for. For the adventurous ones, I'd recommend having it with the caf? calva, an espresso with a shot of calvados on the side. Feel free to pour it in your espresso to spice it up!"
La Muse Gueule,French,4,?11-20,4,8/23/11,"One the second night, I ate at La muse Gueule ! One star for the spot : When you get to the restaurant, there is a very nice terrace. It is very simple, casual, relaxed and informal place. You feel like at home.One star for the quality of the food : This is a French restaurant. I was expecting good food - I am French - but I had delicious food. I had a ratatouille for main and creme brulee for desert. The desert is my way to define if a restaurant is really good. And if they have creme brulee, it is the best point of comparison. They hit the 10/10 !One star for the quantity in the plate : When people proportions are different in Germany, I agree. In spite of the fact that La Muse Gueule is a French restaurant, the plate I was served was by somehow a German hand :D I was very hungry, and it was so good, I ate it all because I did not want to waste. I was full. I think I will have to go back to the gym after my trip to Berlin !One star for the people : Waitress nice. Waiter very nice. For some reason the waiter brought bread twice to my table and asked several times if everything was ok with a banana smile. Very very nice waiter :)Anything else to add ? I did not put a five star here because there were a few bigs flying around me while I was outside. I know they are supposed to be proteins but I had a complete meal. No need for more proteins XD If you are alone in Berlin until the 28th August 2011, feel free to get in touch with me and I will join you for a finger licking good meal at La Muse Gueule."
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,9/15/17,"Amazing food!! Must go in Berlin!! Everything we tried were delicious. We had the spaghetti with scallop,shrimp and algae sauce, ravioli with black truffles, and the haddock (white fish) special with pumpkin pur?e and pear. Great service! Everyone was very friendly and attentive. The waiter explain every dish on the special menu in English. Highly recommended!!!!"
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,10/31/14,I rarely write reviews but after the Hotel recommended Cavallino Rosso and we ate a meal there I had to say something nice.  The Owner ? meet us at the front door with gusto.  Not all the menu was in English so he explained the items with a lot of personal pride.  We wondered on several of the combinations such as Mushroom soup with a side of Herring.  The raviolis with Truffles were great and probably the first time I ever considered saying stop as the waiter was shaving them on.  Everything was very tasty.  The bill came and all the food was less than the nice bottle of wine.  truly great night out.
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,4,1/3/13,"Gehobener Italiener, Bedienung manchmal etwas verpeilt. Essen besser als beim Italiener ums Eck, aber preislich auch anspruchsvoller. Im Sommer kann man draussen sitzen, ist aber halt recht laut, da dort zuegig gefahren wird. Frau Shavan schaut auch immer mal wieder vorbei arbeitet ja gegenueber :-)"
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,2,4/17/09,"Tiny portions, bland ambiance and uninterested service. This place could technically be a good Italian restaurant to stop in now and again. Unfortunately the food is mediocre and portions are so small that you'd think they were doing this intentionally to save money. Further, you have a bunch of politicians here around lunchtime which in and of itself isn't bad but it's just not my crowd. Many of them seem to be regulars and get better service. Oh well, there are plenty of better options in Berlin and in the vicinity. I won't be coming back."
Trattoria Peretti,Italian,4,?11-20,5,11/29/15,"Fantastic service and great food! We were welcomed by a polite and pro-active staff that made us feel welcome the second we entered the restaurant. A home cozy Italian style with a wide selection of several traditional Italian dishes. We went for some appetizers, cheeses and salamis, being served a wide selection of good cheeses and cold cuts. The pizzas were huge and we were not able to finish them. Perfect, thin and crisp pizza dough, with lots of flavor from the Parma hams and cheese varieties. The staff always made sure we had everything we needed and I highly recommend the restaurant for anyone in the mood for Italian food and a good experience."
Trattoria Peretti,Italian,4,?11-20,4,8/3/16,"These 4 stars I gave need to be considered from the ""business point"" of view. I think I have never been served two really tasty courses that quickly. Really efficient use of my lunch break. So German - these Italians! A colleague recommended their business lunch because you get a soup and a main course (you can pick out of 4 options) for only 6,90?. We all know that cheap is not always great so I wanted to see myself how price and taste interact here...The carrot soup with chicken I had as an appetizer would never win a price anywhere but it was a decent soup that I enjoyed. For the main course I chose paste with a creamy sauce, broccoli and chicken which I thought were great!Additionally, I also got the bread with oil, salt and pepper with my meal.All in all I can definitely say GREAT value on the lunch menu here. This might have been the quickest service experience I have ever had while the waiter still was very friendly and professional.I wasn't expecting it but I recommend this place for lunch."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/9/18,"Everything about this place is FANTASTIC!I walk in and I immediately feel cozier as I am surrounded by the colorful walls and mingling voices. The waiter was attentive and seated me promptly. I ordered the mix-teller, which is basically a huge platter with everything they have - hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, kebabs, etc. - for only ?7.50! Each bite made me want more, and everything on the plate tasted so perfect together (and individually)!It might be difficult to get indoor seating if you go in a group larger than 4 people, but this place is definitely a gem. I usually don't revisit restaurants when I'm traveling but I'll make an exception for this place!"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/22/17,"Great Mediterranean food! Good service and a place with good vibes overall.The mix platter gas great and the blakava was delicious with the right hint of honey.Fair prices and good food!"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/8/17,"Amazing food and service.I had read about Yarok before arriving in Berlin because I wanted to try Syrian food. I was traveling with a large group and really looking forward to trying it but also nervous as I was bringing many people along who may not have had much experience with Middle Eastern food...plus pleasing a big group is always a challenge. Yarok did not disappoint! It was worth the hype; everyone was happy with their meals & the price.I suggest sharing with friends to try different things. We were a big group & the staff was extremely accomadating. A platter between 2 is perfect. I shared the mixed platter that came with a few meat dishes and a few vegetarian (hummus, falafel, tabouleh, eggplant etc). Highly recommend!Good for vegetarians as they have many veggie appetizers & a vegetarian sharing platter as well. Tips - 1. Be prepared to wait as the place gets busy2. Cash only"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/16/17,We were getting tired of German Food. So we found this Syrian restaurant. Cozy and family run place filled with locals ( I am guessing this since I didn't hear any English speakers).  The Place was clean; the Food was fresh and tasty. The Only caveat is they take cash only. We were very nervous because we had small amount of cash with us. I recommend this place for a visit.
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/12/17,"Amazing food, good sized portions and great value for money. A nice change from the typical currywurst and doner kebab. Highly recommend the platters as they have everything - hummus, kebab, falafel, tahini - for 8 euros. Service prompt and friendly as well. Only drawback is the small space, so it can get pretty cramped. A great dining choice on a hip street in Mitte."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/25/17,"I'm a middle Eastern food convert! This was beautiful and delicious food, like I've never tasted before a must try in Berlin!"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/17/17,"Extremely friendly customer service, accommodating. The food was mediocre to me, but the food versus price was very fair in my opinion.I tried a platter that had a couple of salads and couple of different grilled meats and falafel."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/11/17,"A must-try. Good for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Get the #32! It's a little bit of everything. Syrian wine is good too. The staff is very polite, the seating is open and plentiful. But the food is truly amazing."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/1/17,"First time having Syrian food and I have no idea if it is authentic or not, but honestly it was pretty delicious! I ordered the sampler and was not disappointed. Everything on the dish was really tasty and fresh. They were also able to serve us in English. I would definitely come here again. Note: seating is a bit limited/cramped."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/29/17,"If you don't know this place, you will probably pass it by while you are searching for it! It a small corner restaurant with some tables outside but with very good food and very low prices! The hummus was great and the vegetables very tasty! The service is super helpful!"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/9/17,"Hands down the best food we found in Berlin. The chickpea halloumi soup is so rich and satisfying on a cold evening. The fava bean salad is the perfect accompaniment - light and refreshing with herbs and lemon. The vegetarian platter allows you to try a bit of everything and the falafel is the best we've ever had - crisp outside but still light and flavorful in the center. Ginger tea and black tea rounded out the meal. I am going to be searching for that soul recipe when I get home! Prices are very good - we came here twice during our 3-day stay in Berlin, one meal was ?31 and the other ?23!"
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,3,12/29/16,"After reading all great reviews I hoped for an amazing original Arabic food and..... I got really disappointed. Food was very average. The biggest advantage of this place is service (5 stars).I wouldn't recommend Yarok. There are much better places serving Arabic specialities in Berlin."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/27/17,We saw this local hole in the wall place and it is by far the best food we ate in Berlin. Everything we ordered was delicious.
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/14/16,This is the best falafel I've had anywhere on earth. Middle East countries included. Lighter and fluffier than I ever imagined. Totally unexpected to find this in Berlin. Service was friendly as well and it's fairly cheap. Might go back tonight.
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/20/17,"Very good quality, small place on a busy street. Nicer than a take-out place, but not quite a dining room. Seating for around 24 inside and a dozen outside on the utilitarian street patio. Food was very good and I'm a fan of Middle Eastern cuisine."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/17/16,"Everyone else has said pretty much most of the things I want to say, so just my two cents:Syrian wine is totally not worth it (perhaps unsurprising).This place is excellent, but there are just so many other places that are just a liiiiittle bit better."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/15/16,"I went there after a museum visit with two friends. We weren't that much hungry so we ordered a vegetarian mix-plate for two. The staff was friendly and the food came very fast. The plate was beautiful served with falafel, hummus, haloumi, zuchini in pastry crust, makaly, tabula, couscous and mutable. So there was a large choice and I think the helping is suitable for two hungry people. Everything was delicious but comparable in taste with all the other, maybe less expensive arab restaurants here in Berlin. So when you are in the proximity, you can try, but I would recommend you other eating places."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/15/16,"Yarok is my new favourite spot when it comes to falafel. Take your favourite falafel spot and leave me alone because the best one is here and you are one little liar (just kidding I respect your belief).Yarok serves delicious and highly asthethic plates of Syrian food. Decide if you want to have grilled meat, haloumi or falafel. Can't decide? Then take the mixed plate with everything on it.The vegetables are fresh and the falafel crispy on the outside but soft and creamy on the inside (so good).I can also recommed their mokka with cardamon which is really to die for! The owners are super nice and even though the venue is rather small I love to spent my time here."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/19/17,"Extremely delicious! We had chicken salad and mixed plate for one. All the flavors were superbly mixed together, and pita bread was fresh and tasty. Plus it was not expensive at all. Staff is very helpful and quick to respond."
Yarok,Syrian,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/10/17,The food was unbelievable!!!!!!!!! I'm obsessed with middle eastern/ mediterranean cuisine and this place was top notch. The prices are so good in relation to the amount of food that you get. The yogi tea was phenomenal and honestly any of the main dishes will knock your socks off. So happy to have eaten here during my time in Berlin!
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/23/17,"My chicken doner was top notch. Hot, juicy, tender meat is always awesome. I really liked how filling it was and after eating it, I wanted to sleep for days. The fries were okay."
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/27/17,"This place saves me every night after a long shift. It's not the best D?ner in town,  but also not that bad. and at 4am after not eating for 8 hours everything tastes like heaven.The guy who works there is really friendly and puts so much meat inside my D?ner box that I can't even finish the whole thing.If you are stuck in the area in the middle of the night I would totally recommend, During the day there might be some other good options to try :)"
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/12/17,Chicken D?ners are so tasty here. One of my go-to places for one. The staff are also really friendly which is nice. There is a small table to sit inside which is handy during winter!
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,2,11/29/17,"D?ner with cheese and some lemon, but nearly no meat inside. Only vegetables, cheese and salat. You can search the meat"
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/19/16,"The chicken d?ner here is a delicious alternative to Mustafas's Gemuse Kebap (the one in Mehringdamm with the ridiculous long lines!). The pita itself is good as the sesame seeds on top of it are slightly toasted. I ordered the chicken d?ner with everything so it came with lots of veggies (both fresh and those that were grilled). There's a variety of sauces and I can't remember which one I picked, I just asked for his recommendation. I liked that the sauce was not too overpowering so that you can taste the chicken and all the other flavors. There's limited seating indoors and tables outdoors."
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/31/14,"I was very much satisfied with this place when I went. It was my first time having d?ner and the experience was great. There is a seating area outside and it's under a tent, so there wasn't any snow or water covering up tables and chairs. There is also a bar inside that you can stand and eat at. If you're sensitive to the cold. I happily ate outside, though. The food kept me warm enough. The people who work there are great. They're nice and talkative. It wasn't busy at all when I went, so we had a chance to chit chat during the ordering process. My experience was excellent. I thought the food was delicious, but my cousins who have had d?ner before thought it was mediocre. They said they've had better d?ner in Germany in the past, but I can't really speak on their experience. I had the opportunity to try d?ner from another top rated place in the city of Berlin and I must say, I would still consider my experience here to be satisfactory. And not just limited to the taste of the food, but my overall experience was great. It's a nice intimate setting that was close to where I'm staying with delicious food and it's incredibly cheap. If I'm not mistaken my d?ner was only about 2.5 or 3 euros. I absolutely can not complain about this place."
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/14/15,"I've been here several times both (super) late and during the day, and it's pretty decent. They have really great Gem?se kebabs which even come with cheese - always a nice bonus.  Also they are one of the few places I've seen that have Jalape?os for your kebab on request!  The only downside to the Dach is that it seems like they give you less than they used to while charging more. It could have just been the past few times I've been in, and it could depend on the person who's making it, but they have definitely been cutting down on how full the D?ners turn out.  I personally think the new Mustafa's on Warschauer Str. is a better deal, but it's all about location when you're talking about a late night snack!"
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/23/14,"After a drinking night you just need that little something to straighten things out - and that is exactly it.When I got there (2:30am on a weekday) they were almost about to close, but let me in for a quick d?ner.Although the late hour and the urge to close the guy behind the counter was nice, smiling and gave me a big generously filled d?ner, with all the goodies! When I said I wanted no salad he just put extra beef in it so it won't be to dull! That is awesome. Super awesome. Nothing like being tipsy and enjoy every bite you take, even my friend couldn't stop sampling my food... Hahahahaha"
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/2/15,"Best chicken d?ner in Friedrichshain. The d?ner is stuffed with vegetables, feta and a lot of meat."
D?ner Dach,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/30/15,"The chicken doner Mit brot was delicious-- great flavored. Order it ""mit alles"" to get all of the wonderful toppings. And only 3.5 euros!"
eins44,German,4.5,Above ?41,5,9/16/17,"Best meal we had in Berlin. Everything was fresh, creatively presented and perfectly balanced in flavor. The service was also impeccable and friendly; our waiter looked like a Ken doll! My friends and I spent hours there enjoying the food and wine over thoughtful conversations. I also loved how beautiful the decor was, and the vibe wasn't pretentious or cold. I would definitely return!"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,11/29/17,"I went there for dinner on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and it was packed. Great atmosphere with the obligatory German memorabilia (classic & WWII). The food selection was great. I had the Berliner Eisbein (boiled pork knuckle, smashed peas, and a boiled potato) and a Krombacher Pils... and they were the perfect way to start my month in Deutschland."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,12/18/16,"This is a small restaurant on a side street off the Ku'damm that is not at all touristy, so it's a good place to experience some genuine Berlin food and atmosphere. When I went, the building the restaurant was in was covered with scaffolding so it was a little hard to find. It's very comfortable with a couple of rooms, one of which had a bar and the other just tables. The staff was friendly and the service good by German standards. I got a dark beer and the Berliner Teller. This dish consisted of three types of meat and some potatoes and sauerkraut. The meat included some type of ground beer party, a sausage that tastes like a Bratwurst, and a slice of ham. It was a huge serving, very well prepared and hearty. The prices were good and I think I paid only around 20 EUR for the beer and meal. I liked the decor in the hotel, with some reproductions of German portraits on the wall cross from me. I visited in the early evening and had no problem getting a table for one (unlike some other restaurants they did not have a reserved sign on many tables). This was one of the better meals I had on my visit to Berlin--I recommend visiting this restaurant."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,9/24/16,"Not looking to wander far from the hotel after 12hrs of travel, Gasthaus Krombach was convenient AND a great find. The bartender spoke English, though I knew right away what I was after: a plate of currywurst and a mug of beer.Having currywurst in Berlin is like having pizza in NY: sure, there's a lot of unimpressive ones out there but it's far and away better than any imitation you'd find overseas. The wurst was excellent: the casing gave a nice bite to the gently seasoned meat while the curry sauce was much more than ketchup with with curry powder; it came closer to a curry gravy. The side of fries were hot and crisp, and all the better washed down with a Krombacher Pils. Definite plus for the music: you probably won't find too many German beer halls blasting old American blues."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,9/12/17,"We are in Berlin and we had food at other places and by far this is the best yet as of now.  Very friendly staff, great ambience and great food"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,10/22/17,Very good German food at a reasonable price considering the location off of Kudamm Strasse. All 3 members of my party enjoyed their food and the service was excellent.  I would return if I was in the area.
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/26/17,"A very nice ""gasthaus"" as the German call it. No friendly dog at the time when I was there (mentioned by others). But there was friendly staff. I enjoyed my typical German Currywurst. Not the cheapest in town, but for the money you get two of them with french fries.The place is very nice and everything I expected from a German gasthaus. Typical German furniture and the walls have historical pictures of Berlin on it. The menu is also available in English. I've had a great time here!"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,2,8/21/16,"First night to Berlin and this restaurant had great reviews, one block off the popular area it seemed like it might be a good choice.... No clue how the ratings are as high as it is.... I tend to rate a bit in the high side so when I give a low rating..... It is really low...   The potatoes were supposed to be hot and they were served cold... The schnitzel was ok...  The pork fillet with mushroom sauce was pretty good but the noodles that came with it were undercooked.... So in general, the meat was good but the sides like potato or pasta was pretty disappointing.... Atmosphere is perfect.... Open windows to the street and the staff were friendly.  Just need to work in the side dishes and get them a bit less salty, a bit warmer... And a bit tastier....If you go here just keep some low expectations for any side dish and you will be okay....."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,3/8/16,"Short story: awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome location, awesome staff, all comes at a reasonable price. I have no complaints at all!Long story: my friend and I were both visiting from another country, and we never had good German food where we came from, so we explored around Yelp and stumble onto this restaurant nearby the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. When we first enter, we were welcomed by a friendly waitress who asked if we made any reservations, to which our answer is no. She then said ""oh then please go ahead and take a seat wherever you like, just avoid those tables over there"" and point out a few tables that were clearly reserved. We settled down quickly and experienced pretty good services. The waiters and waitresses were pretty attentive, very warm and welcoming and the food were served pretty fast.We ordered the following, and please forgive me if I got the spelling wrong:Berlin Eisbien (12.90 eur) - boiled pork knuckle, side of saurkraut, horseradish dip/spread, some kind of apple sauce I think, and whole boiled potatoSchnitzel (18.90 eur) - breaded fried veal, side of some kind of sauteed or stewed potatoBratwurst (4.90 eur) - pork sausage, side of friesBeer - Berlin Pilsner and Krombacher (4 eur+ each, can't remember the exact price)It's a lot for two people, but it was so good that we had to finish everything to do it justice, so I guess that's the only downside - you'll really be stuffed and can hardly walk."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,8/19/16,Excellent German food. I had the Wienerschnitzel and my wife had the cabbage rolls. Both were excellent. The roasted potatoes were perfectly prepared and mushrooms were a tasty addition in the mild white sauce.  The Berlin potato and sausage soup was a great starter. The service was perfect. Highly recommend.
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,3,9/1/16,"It was very okay, I thought. Good locale off of Kurf?rstendamm, nice little old world feeling inside. Carpeted which is weird here, but nice place.I ordered the grill special, which had little cuts of turkey, pork, a steak, and a sausage. The meats where a bit watery, especially the steak, which makes me think it was frozen. They were seasoned okay, cooked well. My wife had the pork schnitzel, it was not that good. My brother-in-law had the Eisbein, which he liked. All-in-all it was very average food, and for spending ?20 each to get it (with two beers and a bottle of water), it's just not worth it for the price. In Berin I kind of expect better than average for that money. So, I wouldn't necessarily not go back, but I'd probably try some other German food places before going back here."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/20/16,"The best meal I had in Berlin. Extremely tasty food. I ordered the roast pork with potato dumplings and red cabbage. Covered in gravy. Delicious, delicious gravy. Service was efficient. Warning, the portions are HUGE! Even compared to the large American sizes I'm used to at home. I couldn't finish my dinner, despite being ravenous before. A real shame, because I wanted to try some desserts. I saw some at other tables and the apple strudel looked incredible.Share your meal and then get dessert! ;)"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/22/15,"Really good german food!We just got to berlin and found this amazing restaurant/bar close to our hotel at Kudamm and loved it!We had the weiner schnitzel(deep fried pork filet) and the bratwurst(berlin grilled sausage) and couldn't have had a better first meal in Germany!The schnitzel came with lots of crunchy french fries and a little but really delicious salad and the bratwurst was grilled and crunchy, with sauerkraut(cabbage) which was perfectly made, tasting sweet and sour!!Both dishes really well served, with really good price, we payed 25 euros for both dishes and two beers! The staff was really friendly and attentious, even though they speak little english! I would also recommend the weinhenstephen weiss beer! Cheers!"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/11/17,Came here after a night at the Staatsoper which is nearby. Had to wait a bit to get some seats but the staff was always very friendly and professional. The menu was pretty traditional German food that you will find in most Gasth?user  although it did include some extra Berlin specialties. I ordered a really nice pepper steak (maybe a little too much pepper but that's nitpicking) and my wife loved her Zwiebelrostbraten. The meal came with a nice salad which sadly you don't see too often here. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with classic paintings and images of Berlin. Will definitely go back!
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,4/10/16,"Traditional German food. Good beer. Friendly staff. What more can a tourist want?We had ate off the house special plate. Sausage with leek soup- fantastic meal. Oh don't forget Berliner Pilsner on ample quality!!!"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,5/5/17,Friendly and cozy restaurant with better than average quality food and service. Good draft beer selection.
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/24/16,"Loved it! We ordered Berlin style potato soup with sausage (delish!) and the rump steak meal (steak was perfection...medium rare and soft enough to cut with a butter knife...melt in your mouth!) My son ordered the curry wurst (great flavor...fresh and kind of light lemony flavor, not overwhelming with the curry). Also banana juice which we loved!! Very delicious. Service was ok...the blonde older waitress mentioned in other reviews is ok... She smiled at us several times. It was very busy and it seems like she might be the one in charge...but our food came out fast enough and she checked on us several times. Very nice ambience, cozy pub-like feel with big doors opened to the patio but maybe just a bit fancier than a pub. Good price for the portions and quality! Took a long time to get our check though. My only complaint."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/22/16,"We got 2 plates of sausages and 2 salads, it was the best food i tried for the past few days. Price is not high and the atmosphere here is great! Highly recommend this place!"
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,4,4/10/17,"After two weeks in Germany and many fine restaurants, Gasthaus Krombach was the best yet. Spectacular traditional German food with good service. Some of the best creamed spinach anywhere. The meatloaf was also wonderful. Large portion so no room for desert."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,1,7/5/16,"Sat there for 15 minutes and nobody came to my service so I left.The place is packed though but the attitude of the waitress is really off putting..."
Gasthaus Krombach,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/23/15,"Was in Berlin on vacation and wanted original German food. Stumbled upon this restaurant and was extremely impressed. Staff was very friendly, and spoke English, and had English menus. All typical German/Austrian food is available, and the prices were very fair. I enjoyed the bratwurst which came with a large portion of sauerkraut and potatoes. I would return here easily for delicious German food. Highly reccommend."
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,9/15/17,"Super warm and cozy place! The owner was very nice, the food very good and not expensive at all!! Nice combination of tastes!3 tapas per person is what they recommend and I would agree!Definitely I m going again until I try all what they have to offer!! Make sure you have a reservation before you go, as it s a very small place!"
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,5/17/17,The sampler platter and the feta/tomato salad were divine. Everything was seasoned perfectly!
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,4,8/7/16,"Small nice place, they had really nice tapas and nice staff, not too expensive. Make sure you reserve a table before you go there. You can only pay with cash!!!"
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,11/14/15,Amazing tapas and service. They had a mushroom special tonight that blew my mind. Get here early as specials can run out. Nice wine selection too.
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,4/3/13,"Just in case, You are not sure, if You would like to have spanish dishes for lunch, don't wait to make a reservation. Needed. I would say, You won't find better Tapas in Berlin. Tapas, Wine, Atmosphere, Service, everything for itself a 5-Star rating.Ich mach's kurz und b?ndig: Must Be Location !Die Speisen, die Weine, der Service und das Ambiente garantieren einen unvergesslichen Abend. Ich habe selten Tapas in einer so guten Qualit?t geniessen d?rfen, verbunden mit einer ausgezeichneten Weinempfehlung und einem sehr leckeren, spanischen Mineralwasser. Dazu ein Service, der auf charmant lockere, aber nicht aufdringliche Art zum Wohlbefinden beitr?gt. Nat?rlich mit Berliner Schnauze. Wir durften einen eindrucksvollen Abend dort erleben. Vielen Dank daf?r. Selbstredend uneingeschr?nkt empfehlenswert. Reservierung unabdingbar!Und ja, wir kommen wieder. Sicher."
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,2/28/13,"Good food, good wine, good service. Really nice place for tapas, will definitely come back!"
Colibri,Tapas Bars,4.5,?11-20,5,3/10/13,"Wir waren im Colibri zu einem Gesch?ftsessen mit 10 Personen und waren begeistert: hervorragende, innovative K?che (z.B. S?sskartoffelgnocchi mit Salbeibutter, Jakobsmuscheln in einer genialen asiatisch angehauchten Sosse), aber auch Tapas-Klassiker in edler Variante (wie Datteln im Serranomantel). Dazu gute Weine und eine nette Bedienung. Die Preise sind ebenfalls human. Was will man mehr? Mir f?llt nichts ein! Dieser Laden hat das Potenzial zur Stammkneipe. F?r meinen n?chsten Berlin-Besuch ist das Colibri ein Muss!"
Rodolfo?s Tapas Bar,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,9/22/16,"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!!!!!The staff's awesome, great with recommendations. And the food's top-notch.Definitely going back"
Rodolfo?s Tapas Bar,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,7/13/17,"Super nice owners, yummy food that is served quickly and flavors we haven't tasted in weeks. Rodolfo's Tapas was a great change of pace taste. Outdoor seating great on this summer night!"
Rodolfo?s Tapas Bar,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,7/18/14,Had a great dinner at Rudolfo's this evening. Service was great and the food was even better. Extremely welcoming. Had a large plate of Tapas and a few glasses of wine that were fantastic. We will definitely be coming back.
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,9/13/17,"Great atmosphere, very nice meat dishes and great wines. I didn't want to commit to one of the LARGE steaks, and tried the sampler plate (beef, chicken and pork) and a potato. Very good, also had a great tasting tomato,onion & garlic salad."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,11/28/17,"A friendly place to eat in Berlin, we walked around and found this place. It was quite busy but we managed to be seated.The service was fast and friendly. The food was very nice and tasty."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,7/28/17,"Jens' stamp of approval!Rare steak was rare and exceptional good. Service was perfect: not too much, but waiters present when needed. We had an awesome time and left well fed and happy"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,2,1/15/17,"Steakes were not bad, but given the reviews I was expecting much more.There are definitely better steakhouses in Berlin"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,3,7/27/17,Went here after searching for some good places in Berlin for dinner. No issue making a reservation and got our seat straight away. Beer selection was adequate as were the other options (my wife loves her cocktail). Food came relatively quickly and was pretty good. Server did focus on a neighboring table of young women so we had to get his attention for service.
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,5/6/17,"Came here for lunch and this place did not disappoint. Good sirloin steaks and sides. The wife had the Mediterranean plate with mixed vegetables and fried potato wedges. My son had the rustic skewer with beef and pork. I had a small sirloin steak with three sides. Baked potato and sour cream, mixed vegetables and the mushrooms and onions. The sides were each in their own small bowl with more than I expected. The prices were quite reasonable and we all enjoyed our meals. The sour cream tastes a bit different than what you find in the USA but was good nonetheless. I recommend this restaurant for an excellent steak in Berlin."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,8/6/17,One of the better steak places in Berlin. Te prices are absolutely great. The well above average quality of the steaks are absolutely stunning. Have been here three times and always left with a full stomach and only had delicious and well cooked steaks regardless if I ordered it rare or medium rare.
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,5/12/17,"Appetiser and main course super spot on, we had asparagus soup and deep fried mushrooms, a lady steak and pepper steak for main. We ordered beef at medium- and that seemed to be good. I suggest medium as the most cooked order. Desert was a dissapointment; crepes and ice cream, where the crepes was cold, that's the reason for only 4/5"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,9/3/17,"It's pretty good, steak is OK, they just changed there menu, so it's different, and we could order by picture, a little bit upset for first try because of this. Luckily food are pretty good."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,6/24/17,"My husband and I are wrapping up a European tour and this place is on the top of our list for dining experiences. They had menus in English and all the staff spoke English. Neither of us had steak, so I cannot speak to that. Lots of options for sides and sauces. I had garlic soup, a mixed salad and a side of mashed potatoes which were all amazing. The soup was delicious and very unique, salad with a wide variety of spiralized veggies.. so fun! My husband had the scampi which he loved. The waiter, and all the staff, were incredibly kind and personable. You can tell that all the staff really get along and enjoy working there. They are very attentive and hard working. We ate inside although they have plenty of outdoor seating. The atmosphere is great."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,2/15/15,"This place is a keeper. As my dad came for another I had to impress with some good steak place for him and his friends (and me!)After a few places were already booked for Friday night I decided to try booking a table here - they were friendly from the start.Booked and reserved the table for us at a good spot in the restaurant.The design doesn't aim to be very fancy, and so are the prices. But the service is really great and they do a really good job around there. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, explained everything patiently and gave us tips about what we should or should not order.The starters came rather quick but we waited for a while (about 50 mins) for the main dishes.For a starter I had a tomato basil soup which was great - creamy, soft and well seasoned.Now for the main dish - I had a 250g fillet MW, great piece of steak! Comes with garlic butter on top.The beef was tender, well grilled and with some nutty aroma - all the other four were also very satisfied (they ordered a grill mix, a chicken breast and a rump steak).Also- the red wine sauce is really adding to the meat, loved it.The plate comes completely clean with the butter on the side, all the extras are served in different plates.For the dessert we had the Apple strudel and creme br?l?e which were also not too bad.great experience, no fancy atmosphere and good food. If you like steaks you better check it out,"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,9/9/16,The service was EXCELLENT and the food was delicious.  I recommend this place if for nothing else the absolute professionalism of the staff.
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,3,4/3/17,"Another case of an entirely reasonable and decent restaurant being over rated and portrayed as exceptional. A little bit off the beaten track. Good service, quick turn around and a nice selection of South American wine. A solid 3 stars and well deserved - not a 5 star exceptional experience as you might be led to believe by the other reviews."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,3/22/16,"Everything was fantastic, but not the steak itself.the waiters were friendly and helpful, the athmosphere was good, the restaurant looked good, the sides (veggies and potatoes) were delicious but just the steak was a little chewy...Maybe we just had bad luck and usually its fantastic, who knows.So all in all I definately would recommend this restaurant, it?s worth giving it a shot!"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,1,6/6/16,"Everyone is crazy about their reviews. Went here for dinner and it was awful. First off the ""baked"" mushrooms are not baked at all, they are deep fried...as were the chicken nuggets. Both lacked any flavor whatsoever. I had the steak and my guest had the fish. The fish was incredibly dry and the steak had a sour taste to it. They couldn't wait to get us out of there and insisted we pay so that they could close up. Instead of closing, they rushed us so that they could sit outside and eat and smoke cigarettes."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,12/19/15,"Great food.  For my main I enjoyed the rump steak with green beans and baby potatoes.  My husband had the pork medallion which was also great.  The kids enjoyed chicken nuggets and the pork fillet.  We also had desserts which were ok, but the main meals were the stand out.  We'd definitely return!"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,4/16/15,"Wonderful place! Reminded me a bit of how I thought of fancy restaurants when I was a kid back in the late 70's and early 80's. Very welcoming to start with, Perfect and friendly service, the ""Filet Asador"" was so tender and well of taste, and The prawn that comes with it too. We ended with the classic cr?me brulet, tha had a tiny taste of lemon which was nice and made it special. When the bill came, we were surprised how good the price was. Can't but recommend the place to anyone searching for nice, argentinian food in Berlin."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,4,11/26/15,"I went here with a colleague to celebrate, a little more expensive than your average eatery around the corner but the meat is worth it. My colleague had had the steak with mushroom sauce and I had the orange cointreau sauce steak. The mushroom sauce was excellent and the meat very very good, it all came cooked as we ordered so nothing to complain. Except that the orange sauce was more like orange vinegar, and did not compliment the meat at all, fortunately the waiter also gave me the mushroom sauce without even blinking and with and 'of course sir' and I was happy. Service was excellent and friendly. Not sure why I paid for the most expensive sauce when it was inedible. But the meat really was super tender, I guess I'll just go for another sauce next time. All in all, recommendable for sure."
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,3,11/24/15,"Steaks are okay, nothing out of this world. Could use some more flavor. Service was good, appetizers weren't anything special"
Steakhouse Asador,Steakhouses,4.5,?11-20,5,10/15/15,"Very happy to have found a steak restaurant in Germany where medium rare means medium rare by north american standards. All food was prepared perfectly, presentation was great, and service excellent. Will be back."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/13/17,"An excellent and deservedly popular Italian located on the delightful Viktoria Luise Platz.The restaurant has a small outside eating area at the front, but a much larger dining room inside which stretches a long way back. The decor has a motorcycling theme, with half a dozen bikes on display, and lots of posters, photographs and trophies. (I gather this reflects the chef's passion.)The food is traditionally Italian; there's a limited selection of pasta, a choice of around a dozen pizzas, but most people were enjoying traditional meat and fish dishes as mains.Our group of four had an excellent meal: starters of calamari, mixed salad, and mozzarella and tomato salad were followed by linguine with clams, porcini and saffron risotto and tagliatelle with meatballs. Portions were generous and the quality was outstanding. (Best risotto in years.) Two courses with beer and water can to ?160 for four, including service.Service was friendly and they speak reasonable English, alongside German and Italian.Definitely worth a visit but it is best to book as they're packed, even on Mondays."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,6/18/15,"Definitely a foody place! Reservation is needed. Small place with big appetite...offer traditional Italian dishes. If you have been experienced Italian food, traditional ways, then it a good place to start...if you had have, then it's a good place to, temporarily, curl your appetite until you visit Italy again. It's authentic in every ways, outdoor, entry way, inside, bar, tables setting...big pot of parmesan cheese (have a peek behind the bar)...bring your appetite...Buon appetito !"
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/19/15,"My companion and I were here last night for a spontaneous dinner date. We called around 18:30 asking if they still had a free table that evening, and when they said yes, we booked a table for 19:00. Twenty minutes walking later, we arrived, and a table was waiting for us. They have a menu, where all the classic dishes are listed, but I highly suggest to come here with a good memory, as the non-classical seasonal menus are not written anywhere. Rather, one of the staff will orally narrate you what they have for appetizers, as well as main dishes. From how it sounds, it seems that the seasonal dishes are way more interesting than the classical dishes. Same thing goes for the dessert: they don't list them in the menu, but they just narrate it to you. Believe me, the list is long, hence it is indeed a narration.You can ask them to repeat it, if you have a small memory.I took the duck carpaccio as an appetizer, which was served with chantarelles and fennel in a sweet balsamic sauce. That was quite tasty. I followed that with the tuna steak and caponata, and the salty flavor of the tuna matched well with the sweet caponata, which was quite fantastic. My partner ordered the tuna carpaccio, followed by lamb cutlets as a main dish.The wine recommendation was also great: they recommended a white wine from Liguria, which was refreshing and matched well with what we ordered. The bottle wasn't crazy expensive either, just 24 euros for a very delicious alcoholic experience.I am so glad I found this place; having seen it once while jogging in the morning, I always had this place bookmarked, and I am glad we went. I would definitely make an effort to come back again sometime."

Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/1/16,I've eaten at many Italian restaurants across the world and this is one of the best.  We walked in off the street with no reservation on a rainy Saturday night and the owner made us feel like family.  The food was amazing and very reasonably priced.  If you are looking for authentic Italian this is the place to go!
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,5/27/15,"This place is severely overrated. First of all, it's an at least $$$. Second, the service is far from exceptional. This may be due to my outside seating though, which resulted from all tables inside being reserved! Thankfully it wasn't that cold. And the food was just fine, nothing to make a fuss of. Thus I rate my experience as average."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/9/14,"Simply the best Italian food I ever had... The meal commenced with Chianti and olives... Next, we enjoyed the steak carpaccio (which was momentarily baked with black truffles and parmesan cheese.)  We also also had the roasted white asparagus au gratin. (Spargel).  This was paired with a small salad and Schinken.  As an entr?e, we had two variations of the pork platter; one with wine sauce, the other was lemon sauce.  This was accompanied by roasted rosemary potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.Our waiter deserves an A+ for service, hospitality, and humor.  He was passionate about the food, and perfectly accommodating.  The interior and exterior are charming.  A Moto Guzzi theme... Absolutely perfect!!   We will be back."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/10/15,"We were lucky to get a walk in table, but I would say that reservation is an absolute must. It is a small place with some outside seating in the summer. The food is delicious, easily in the top italian restaurants in Berlin. The grilled squid with lentils is perfectly seasoned and has amazing texture and taste. The iberico pork was tender and the sauce was just perfect. The sushi grade tuna tartare was perfect and it all finished with a pistachio dessert that was half frozen.  Prices are maybe a bit higher compared to your regular Italian restaurant, but it is certainly worth the extra spend. Overall an amazing meal, we certainly will go back there."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,6/25/13,"Authentic, home-style Italian food, in a comfortable atmosphere, at a good price. Located on Viktoria Luisa Platz, they have lovely outdoor seating as well, facing the park. The staff, Davide and Francesca, took great care of us. Some delicious specials - try the liver saut?ed in butter with sage, or the zigeuner di manzo !! A++"
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,6/18/15,"The food is very good, but the service is substandard, especIally if you're not Italian. I won't be coming back."
Restaurant Heising,French,4.5,?21-40,5,9/20/14,"The Heising! What can one say about it? The Heising is special, different, old style, a bit quirky, lovely, welcoming. It is also Traditional as traditional gets; Delicious as delicious can be; Unique and perhaps a bit in its own league, or should one say: in its own world. A restaurant is not a good restaurant if the food is not outstanding and special, or different and interesting. At the Heising you get it all: honest, excellent French cuisine, delivered with class, but without pretense and full of honest quality. But what sets the Heising apart from the rest is the ""Heisings"" themselves. Herr und Frau Heising apparently have run this restaurant for more than 30 years. And it seems they have never swayed from their original formula. Even the interior speaks of the 3 decades: beautiful cupboards, made of massive wood, gorgeous tables with mosaic inlays, classic chairs that have hosted dignitaries and common folk like me. Just classic, a bit dated, and all charming. Frau Heising, after you ring the bell to the Restaurant, will greet you personally at the door and guide you to your table. Herr Heising will host you, supported by charming and very personal assistants, throughout the night. Considering they have been doing this for more than 30 years and considering that they are open every day of the week, that could mean that they have been doing this for more than 11'000 days of their lives. Unbelievable! Not only are they good at it, since they got so much practice; but they seem to be enjoying it, thoroughly, still. As I said: Unbelievable!We can only recommend a visit; it will be a visit that honors their talent and dedication, while allowing you to enjoy their ancient art of hosting and great French cooking."
Restaurant Heising,French,4.5,?21-40,1,1/9/18,"Was coming at 19:45, door was closed, I was knocking but nobody did not open it ,although it was I few peoples inside"

Restaurant Heising,French,4.5,?21-40,5,9/25/08,"The best french cuisine in Berlin. Better than Cafe de la Paix or other Parisians restaurants. Discreet, elegant, stylish, conservator."
Babbo Bar,Italian,5,?11-20,5,9/12/16,"Brilliant dinner in intimate neighborhood restaurant. The food leans toward Italian with many pasta and risotto choices. Artichoke and charcuterie starters were perfect. When we finished them we asked our host to hold our bottle of wine for us and save us our table, so we could go home and get dressed for the evening. Upon our return all was waiting. Shared a wilted spinach salad and fabulous prawn and pasta dish unlike anything we've ever had."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,11/5/17,"This place was one of my favorite meals during my trip to Berlin. Perfect authentic German food to start off the trip. The ambience in this place is cozy. There's this huge burning wood fire that adds something really special to this place. For our meal, we ordered the fire grill favorites and added on one additional combo meal for three people. It comes with a variety of sausages and sides and you get to taste test everything. My favorite was the cheese sausage and mashed potatoes. We paired the food with a beer flight. So good. My only regret was not trying the currywurst too."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,2,11/1/17,"The yelp reviews were so positive, I was really looking forward to this place. It pains me to write a ""MEH"" review. I should have left when we walked in the door around 5pm and the lady at the register literally rolled her eyes at us, but it was cold and wet outside, and it smelled good, so I ventured forth. My mistake.The currywurst sauce tasted like ketchup with curry dumped in it. Very meh. I posted a picture to Facebook and 3/3 German friends were horrified and demanded I try some other place. Even the half dozen Americans who'd spent time in German agreed that the pic did not look like any decent kind of currywurst they'd ever tried. So strike one.Twice the waitress (who was the one at the register who rolled her eyes at us coming in the door) screwed up the order. We ate it anyway, because the bread was super tasty and just seemed easier than provoking her.I will say, the sauerkraut was fantastic, and the sausages and other things I saw going to other tables looked and smelled great. Go for anything but the currywurst and you'll probably be fine."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,9/6/17,"Super cool place! The coocko clocks are so cool!The staff is very nice and has good recommendations regarding food and drinks!They have a machine that slow cooks the pork in the terrasse that is worth a look!The food was great and tasty. Portions are a bit big for one person with ""normal"" apetite!"
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,10/15/17,"We had a group of 16 friends visiting Berlin from Michigan, USA and found this restaurant on Yelp.  The place had many customers that night but more than 100 seats in several dining rooms, so they were able to seat us quickly.  The waiters spoke English well and were courteous.  We really enjoyed the beers and the sausage combination platter the waiter assembled for us, with sausages made of beef, pork, liver, blood, etc. The place is only 15 minutes walking distance from the Brandenburg Gate, which was a good after-dinner exercise to help burn off the delicious  calories we just ingested."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,4,12/22/17,"great service, great food! it was our first time in berlin so we ordered the platter of different kinds of sausages. we loved the cheese sausage! we also tried the beer sampler. would come back again when in berlin. also pro tip if you dont know what to wear know that the place is very warm. dress down!! especially if youre going to be drinking"
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,12/7/17,This is the only restaurant in Berlin that we went to twice. The staff are very friendly and helpful when it comes to beer selection and foods. The food is absolutely amazing. I got the smoked meat soup and a baked potato. Both I would eat every day if I could. The ambiance of this place is calming and sweet. Not commercialized at all! Could not recommend this place more for a relaxing night out in Berlin.
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,8/11/16,"Unglaublich! Unbelievable...Das Meisterst?ck is just that. Everything about this place is amazing.Once you enter, the decor simply yells, ""you've come to the right place!"" & the great service confirms it. Charming wooden chairs surround uniquely modern, quality tables. Everything from the colors to the place mats...to even the restrooms are stylish and comforting. The walls are lined with some handmade, some vintage, & some retro Cuckoo Clocks, which add a pleasant background noise. Oh yes, the food is also amazing. So is their beer menu; and yes, everything else."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,4,7/28/17,"So we showed up before noon, and I have a feeling the usual Berliners don't even get up by then. Nonetheless, they were able to seat us and with their flawless English explained the various sausages they had.We had about 6 different sausages between us and every single one of them was delicious. Two of them were better than any I had ever had in the world previously, it was THAT good!The beer selection, as you might expect, was fantastic.The place is massive, so if you have a large group, this is a great place to go =)"
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,5/10/17,I love German food and this was a great place to eat different sausages with sauerkraut and potato side dishes.  Loved the Berlin Nacht imperial stout beer and liked their beer list.  Place has great ambience and clean bathrooms too.  Prices are reasonable for what we hot.
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,7/19/17,Very good selection of sausages and tasty ribs/pork chops from the open fire grill.  Great selection of local beers too.
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,5/20/17,"Absolutely amazing. We got the flight course, where they pair three 0.1L craft beers with three different German sausage dishes, and every one of them was magical! The ambiance and interior decor is also very nice and an excellent spot for a nice dinner. Highly recommend!"
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,10/22/16,"I've been to Munich, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Hannover, Essen, Frankfurt, and many points in between.  This was the best sausage I've had in my life.  The service can be a bit slow, granted I was here on a Saturday night, but the sausage is beyond compare.  Food heaven when paired with a fine double bock.  Don't miss this place if you have a lunch or evening in downtown Berlin."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,4,12/6/15,"Fine dining with various cuts of sausages. I showed up without any reservation and was seated relatively quickly for lunch. I was just curious at how fine dining would be in Berlin as I didn't have much expectations out of it but it was surprisingly decent. I wish they told us that we could have checked out how the sausages would look at as they did had a display glass of all their sausages which would have been it a lot easier to decide what to eat. Although the pricing of the meals is kind of expensive considering sausages are cheap in general, I would not come here if you were on a budget. It was a nice experience and the quality of the food was good but this is probably more of a one time visit for me due to the cost. I tried the currywurst which was good but was kind of missing the curry flavor. I tried the duck sausage which was kind of lean. As expected the favorite for me was the pork and veal sausage (juicy and seasoned well). The beef with pesto sausage was pretty good too. The lamb sausage was a bit too gamey for me but I'm sure any lamb lover might have appreciated it more than I do. I really enjoyed the wasabi cabbage which was a surprise to me. I didn't expect it to work but it did. I liked the potato salad here as it was less sour than the other places I have tried. I'm not too big on sour dishes.One other positive thing for me at least as a tourist is that they accepted credit cards!"
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,6/7/17,"Service was good. Food was fantastic. Portions were ideal. Atmosphere was epic.  Location was convenient.  The food had that ""other level""of flavor and depth.  Scent of reastaurant reminded me of a restaurant I used to go to when I was younger."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,3,3/22/17,"The atmosphere of this place was cute and fun to eat in. I wouldn't say that the food was too memorable but we were able to be seated quickly and there was a big selection of wine to choose from.As a traveler to Germany and the surrounding countries, I thought the food was good but nothing special. If you are wanting to come here to see the fun cuckoo clocks then you are in for a treat. They are all up the walls and neat to look at."

Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,5,8/19/17,We wanted to find an authentic German restaurant in Berlin during our vacation and Das Meisterstuck was near our hotel.  Very short walk to the restaurant and as typical of most German cities the locals don't show up to eat until later in the evening. We ordered the sampler platter with a selection of three sausages and various sides. They have the meats laid out behind the counter much like a meat market (they also sell the meats uncooked to take home) and then take them to the grill to cook them to order. Very authentic and would recommend them if you are in the area.
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,4,2/16/17,"North American travelling for work in Berlin...Unique spot. The wood burning grill infuses the place with a wicked aroma. It will also do the same to your clothes. Sausages and craft beer are at the heart of the experience. Everything is pretty good. A couple of my sausages were over cooked. The chocolate, chocolate dessert was so good I had it as well on my second night on the way back to the hotel."
Das Meisterst?ck,German,4,?11-20,3,8/26/17,"Cool ambiance and vibe but food was just okay, my salmon sandwich was smothered in horseradish which I didn't quite understand or enjoy. Baked potato was quite good, however."

La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,5,3/17/16,"Came here on a whim as my friend and I were visiting Berlin and had finished a massive shopping spree. We looked for something in the area and found this great little Spanish place. The place was about half full around dinner time on a weekend so we were seated immediately.We started with some sangria and were served complimentary bread and garlic aioli. We also received some tiny cocktail shrimps to nibble on as well. For our entrees we decided to share the seafood paella and the seafood cataplana. We were warned that the paella took awhile but we said we didn't mind. We also had plenty of bread and garlic aioli so that helped curb our hunger. That garlic aioli was soon good. We definitely asked for a couple more rounds of bread and aioli to the point I almost wasn't able to finish our paella once it came to our table. Both our entrees were delicious! I think the cataplana is the one that comes in the special clamshell pot, they said it cooks the dish a certain way to maintain the flavors? Whatever the case, it was delicious! The paella was definitely filling and had good chunks of various seafood in it.Will definitely be back whenever I am in Berlin again!"
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,2,12/26/17,"I should have known better than to visit a Spanish restaurant in Berlin a week after visiting Spain but the choice was due to my dining companions. The service here was slow but that is to be expected in Europe in general since most restaurants seem to start cooking after the order without any prep work done beforehand. Our waiter was slow though in refilling our drinks or taking our drink orders.I had a vegetarian paella that was bland and lacking in flavour. Hard to believe that it was 16 euros given the inexpensiveness of the ingredients. Oh well. At least the venue looked good and catered to large groups. I just wish the food was better."
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,5,5/9/17,"Best Spanish sea food ever!Great taste, perfect seasoned. Garlic, olive oil and lemon...what else?"
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,1,3/12/16,"A friend of mine was looking for a place to get an authentic Spanish Paella, and we were encouraged by the good reviews here on Yelp. He ordered a Seafood Paella while I ordered a Piri-piri Chicken. Both were equally disappointingly tasteless.Over-priced and totally bland food. Not going again."

La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,2,7/10/16,High prices for not so special food. Waiters are busier with watching tv than giving good service.
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,5,11/5/13,One of my favorite restaurants in Berlin. Fresh oysters and shrimp in brandy sauce are my favorite here!!!
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,4,3/1/09,"I went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend who knows how much I like seafood. And I have to say that the seafood here is not too bad, with a huge Spanish influence but they still managed to convey a Portugese flavour to their dishes (mainly by the judicious use of some extra paprika and various dried herbs). The krake (octopus) was quite good, to the point where we stole a krake galicia accidentally from someone else and had to hurriedly re-order it again. The rest of the fish was well-cooked and tasty and one cannot complain at all. It is not quite and will never be the standard of Fischer Fritz, but for the price, it was really very tolerable. What was also a pleasant surprise was the table wine, which was not overpowering or contentious and quite drinkable and very good value at 13 Euro a litre! I had 2 litres before I noticed anything wrong but by then it was, as usual, too late. Oh well. The atmosphere is also quite authentic, done up like a fishing village's taverna, so overall, it is a reasonably-priced place to take your friends for fresh fish."
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,4,9/12/12,"Really enjoyable see-food restaurant. You can choose from the menu or get yourself a fresh squid, lobster, etc and have it grilled. The food quality was slightly above average, but nothing extraordinary. Very attentive and attentive service."
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,1,10/14/14,"Today   I ordered  a whole red snapper  fish, got the fish in pieces, fry and not testy at all.  all fishes in the menu priced for  about 15 Euro, we were  charged only for the fish dish  55 Euro. The waiter told us  1 red snapper cost 70 Euro in Berlin and that he discount it for us, food is madiucer, not testy and it was most expensive price we paid in Berlin, very bad experience,  Totally waist of money and time, bed value for your food,  The waiter took advantage of us , as we are not from the aria. . So many  others good restaurants  and so much cheaper, NOT RECOMMENDED  RESTAURANT ."
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,3,2/8/10,I tried one of their lunch specials today. It came with a creamy potato and broccoli soup and loads of bread with a nice garlic mayonnaisy dip. The main dish came which was garlic chicken. It looked tasty and was decent.

Die meisten Tapas auf dem Teller kamen aus der Dose z.B. die Bohnen, der Thunfisch, die Artischoken. Das Gefl?gel kam nicht aus der Dose, sondern war Tiefk?hlkost. Was sehr schade ist, dass der Tintenfisch, dessen Name sich das Restaurant bedient, auch aus der Dose kam!!! Nur die Champignons waren frisch gekocht. Am schlimmsten ist, dass alles nicht geschmeckt hat! Der Preis dieses kleinen Tellers war 18 Euro!!! Echt unversch?mt f?r die Qualit?t und so eine kleine Portion aber was ich sehr gerne bezahlt h?tte, w?re der Geschmack gut gewesen. Der Wein und das Brot waren der beste Teil unseres Besuchs. Wir waren letztes Jahr in Barcelona und k?nnen mit Sicherheit sagen, dass La Sepia das spanisches Essen und die Tapaskultur beleidigt. Das Restaurant ist einfach ?berhaupt nicht empfehlenswert."
La Sepia,Spanish,4,?21-40,4,1/11/09,"Tasty Spanish/Portuguese restaurant, with an especially nice lunch menu, but also good for dinner. Lots of seafood; the grilled fish is really good, as are the mussels."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/17/15,"Such a cute little place.The food is amazing (and cheap too), the staff is lovely and accommodating and the atmosphere is amazing.I'd go back anytime."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,9/18/14,"Oh boy did yelp steer me in the wrong direction with this place! People gave this restaurant 4/5 stars so i thought It would be great italian food and It was not. Staff was very nice and friendly. Frankly they had nothing really italian on their menu. No typical pasta dishes, no chicken parmagiana. No chicken marsala, no pesto sauce, no penne vodka. It is like this place had no clue what italian food was or how to serve it.   Sad that these servers were so good, yet working at a crap place like this.I ended up ordering 'homemade' gnocchi with homemade tomato basil sauce, it was bland, not very good at all. My dad tried to order chicken parm over pasta and got pieces of grilled chicken tossed in spaghetti from a box over the same plain tomato sauce.  How awful.Their wine selection was pathetic, strange considering its an ""italian restaurant...?'  The server could not even tell me what the ""Sweet wine"" on the menu was. Yes that was its actually called on the menu. They only had three also...pinot, chardonnay, and 'sweet wine.'  Awful selection for any restaurant let alone an Italian one.Overall I would never come back here, I would never suggest it to anyone, and shame on anyone giving this place more then three stars. For what????????? Their food sucks, their menu is not even Italian, and they have no real alcohol. basically the only thing good here were the servers!"
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/22/17,"Nice, authentic italian place. We came on a busy friday, but managed to get at table indoor. Had a lovely dish of tagliatelle and a beer, and everything was well made and tasty."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/30/15,"Very nice food and service, traditional italian cuisine! We liked it and we are going to come back there soon."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/15/15,"Delicious food, huge portions, extremely reasonable prices, complementary bruschetta, uplifting atmosphere, and very friendly staff!  We had a great dinner here!  We got the simple lasagna and the spaghetti with meat sauce, and both were so good that we switched meals halfway through and still only finished about half of each plate...not to mention that each plate was only 7?-8?...that's a steal!  The staff were all very gracious and didn't even seem to mind that we didn't speak German (or Italian).  Highly recommended.  :)"
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,3/16/16,"When you're in the mood for spaghetti, go here. The servers are characters and we love them. Pizza is good. House red is decent. And it's super cheap. Nice little digestif offered on the house after the meal. Happy to have this go-to in the neighborhood."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,10/16/12,"When I visited this place it was packed. Seems like a good idea to make reservation beforehand. There is a menu, which did not impress me at all, but the waiter suggested some seasonal dishes which were very nice. The desserts are absolutely awesome."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/27/15,"Service was friendly and good. The food was excellent.  We had Pizza, spaghetti carbonara and also spaghetti bolonase. All were very good. I strongly recommend you try it."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,7/30/17,"A bit cheesy. The waiters were a bit cheesy with their Italian speak and behavior. Food (pizza) was decent but not outstandingAn experience that can be repeated, but do not expect ""out of this world"" pizza"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/9/17,"Great italians servers! Happy people.Awesome food! Felt like if i was in Italy. Enjoy!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/16,"From having tried pizza all over the world, Luardi's is really on top of their game. The pizza was chewy and crispy just like in Naples.Well done!!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,11/28/16,"Nothing to write home about. Small Italian place, like many other in Berlin. The place was crowded even Monday evening, most probably because of reasonable prices (25 euro per person with wine). But food quality was very debatable. Carpaccio has been served with very strange sauce, Parmesan and rucola (!). Fish was bearable, but one potato and cooked carrot did not fit the dish at all. And again rucola! Why? My companions got a soup and chicken, which did not impress either. So all in all rather one time experience."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/1/17,"Great food, great service!On top we didn't have to wait long to get our food so no reasons to not hand out the 5 stars! Must visit during your stay in Berlin!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,10/10/16,"As a relatively large Italian restaurant at a popular area, I'm disappointed with the Italian food it serves.  A salad with scampi uses ready made dressing or one that tastes like those you pour out of a plastic bottle. For 12.50? in Berlin, I would have expected a decent sized pawn but no. The size is about U15-U20 for those readers from the States. Then, let's talk about the penne arrabiata. A simple dish. I switched penne with spaghetti. The spaghetti tastes like packaged pasta rather than homemade. The sauce is just blah. The kitchen likely used pre-made margarita for the pizza or diluted tomato paste. There should be some garlic but I see none. There is also no heat coming off the pepper they used. Even I couldn't make it that poorly at home. Noted is that the pasta costs 8.50?. Food is so so, did the service made it up? Not in my opinion. Pre-order, he did not ask if I have any question, nor volunteered information about house specials. When I asked for flat water, he brought a small bottle that's just not suitable for a dinner. So, to sum it up, I gave it a two-star.  Maybe just an occasional bad experience given it has a four-star average rating."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/25/16,"Very good service,really nice customer service and good food ! luardi rissotto excellent ! Recommend"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,8/19/16,Great Italian food and service in West Berlin. We had the penne arrabbiata and the pizza. Both were excellent. The wine list was adequate and the service was very good. Highly recommend.
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/17/16,"Wonderful food in the busiest area in Berlin. A hidden gem to most. Went there with friends and ordered 2 risottos and a pasta. Very delicious and prompt service. The only thing was they made me wait for 10 mins at the beginning in the entrance, even with reservation and the restaurant was not full (at 1830). Will give it another chance in a few weeks."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/28/15,Great restaurant. Food quality and taste is excellent. The service is very good. I was amazed how fast they brought the food yet it was very tasty. We ordered the pasta with pesto and pizza margarita. This is definitely the place to eat in berlin
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,3/29/16,"Pesto, pine nut, olive oil pasta with tomato basil mozzarella started was great!  Even had Peroni beer. I recommend even if I personally don't like customer herders in the front of the place. If your in the area worth a stop for a nice Italian restaurant."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,4/27/14,"A perfectly adequate Italian restaurant on Meinekestrasse in Berlin. The waitstaff are attentive and we even got a table for six on a busy Saturday night (thank you, other guests, for moving to another table)! The food is fine, although not absolutely top rate italian, but then again, we're not in Italy. The wines by the glass are average as well. If you go here for the festive and lively atmosphere, not for great dining, you'll have a wonderful time."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/11/15,"Ok, this place is seriously good. The waitstaff is amazing (they sing!!) and if you are friendly you may get a few freebies throughout dinner :) Highly recommended if you get sick of German fare on your travels!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/21/15,"My colleague and I came across this restaurant during a walk around the neighbourhood near our hotel.  The woman out front was helpful and friendly, and the restaurant was doing solid business, so we took a chance and went inside.  It was the day I arrived in Berlin after an overnight flight and I really didn't have much of an appetite.  I only had some of a shared melon and prosciutto appetizer followed by a bowl of seafood soup.  The service was friendly, and the food held promise, so we made a note of the place so we could find it again.We ended up here again a few nights later with a larger group.  With my regular appetite returned, I was up for a pomodoro salad, gnocchi, with tiramisu for dessert. (I know, quite a difference!)  All were very good.  The gnocchi was different from what I'm used to: these were like small stuffed pillows and the gnocchi I'm used to are smaller without filling.  My colleagues also enjoyed their meals, but there was a mix up on one of the orders.  I think that this was a language problem: the wait staff are Italian, and although they have decent enough English, some things don't translate easily or are misheard.  Well, what the waiter lacked in language skills he more than made up by being entertaining, trading jokes and poking fun.  At the end of our dinner, our waiter offered us all a complimentary aperitif: Sambuca, limoncello, etc. -- a very nice surprise and a great way to end the evening."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,9/14/12,"We passed by this restaurant every day when we were leaving our hotel. One day, we stopped in. I wanted pizza. The minestrone soup had a lot of vegetables. This was good since we went all out with the spinach and gorgonzola pizza to share. Inside is pretty fancy. Make sure not to wear a fanny-pack inside. (Why you would even wear this awful accessory when visiting Germany is beyond me!) Outside seating is perfect on a nice day, but the seats go quickly and you might get caught inside. The servers speak German, Italian, and English. Mix it up with a trilingual combo to make your visit to this Italian eatery top notch."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/13/14,"Amazing atmosphere, excellent staff and great food to remember. Add to that a great value for money and you got a perfect restaurants."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,5/3/13,"I absolutely love not just the food and the ambience, but the entire staff that works there.  Each and every time I've been, they great me like family.  Can't imagine staying  anywhere near Luardi's and not going in.  It's a fave!"
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/17/15,Excellent restaurant. The pasta is delicious and the Burratta can't be missed. Wine is great and reasonably priced. Live near by and we go as often as we can!
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4,?11-20,4,7/21/16,"If you go here, you have to eat the fucking burrata. It's juicy, fresh and yeah, just amazing.As main course I had the ravioli with ricotta. That was good aswell but as I already had suspected, it didn't match up with the previous course.It's a tiny restaurang, and it feels like a great place to hang out on now and then if you live nearby. The prices are pretty moderate, as a bonus. But the service needs to cheer up a bit, tbh."
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4,?11-20,3,6/18/13,"Quite a cozy place, perfect for a warm night. Good wine and pasta. A bit pricey though, with the pasta dishes going towards ?10. Still, worth a visit!"
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4,?11-20,5,10/1/12,"I love Italian and for a while there were just a couple of places I enjoyed in Berlin. Not being a friend of some of the places that try to sell you popular cuisine by posting revolutionary posters and hiring only tatooed waiters (anybody living in Berlin know what I am talkiing about) but pumping up prices to tourist trap levels, the Sala da Mangiare was an amazing discovery. I have only been there once but it motivated me to write and I'll go back pretty soon. The pasta is freshly baked (ask the cook to explain you how he does it), service is as friendly and humble as it gets, prices are what you expect for the quality and we got our espresso for free. I'll post back as soon as I try something new. Excellent pick if you like Italian food."
Misir Carsisi,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,2,8/21/10,"Except the veal wich was indeed good and quite lean, I was very disappointed by the cold, crumbly and stodgy warp (the D?r?n's ""tortilla""). Moreover, I asked for it without sauce or vegetables : I had so little meal that my d?r?n looked like a cigar !!!. FOR THE FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE, I HAD TO THROW MY D?R?N due to its consistency... Gosh !"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,11/30/17,"Delicious first German meal, with huge portions and cheerful service. Got the pork goulash and schnitzel with fried egg, both very tasty."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,2/18/17,"Great authentic German spot in the heart of tourist land! After walking around museum island and finishing or museum tour at the DDR Museum, this restaurant was just a short walk away. We got the $9.60 special, which included two pieces of schnitzel, fries, and salad. This was a great deal and totally suitable for 2 people even though it's meant for one. We also got the fried meatballs with mustard to start, which was the highlight of our meal. To top it off, we got two large beers for $4.30 each. Definitely recommend this place."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,1/1/18,"Fast service, food came out quickly! Great food, traditional, family-owned, cute and overall very pleased! :-)"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,11/25/17,"Great local 'hole in the wall' place with WONDERFUL soups and homey ambiance.  Servers are friendly and efficient.  Must try the mushroom soup and the pea soup with bockwurst.  Perfect for a reasonable, filling, and soothing dinner on a cold winter night.  Of course, a local beer or wine helps things go down easy!  Great find!"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,11/8/17,"Great for a typisches deutsches Fr?hst?ck, the Schnitzel was very good, and my friend liked her eggs. Mildly pricey and somewhat hard to find, Schl?gl's is hidden through a walkway and has both inside and outside seating."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,4/25/16,"A good spot for lunch, with a Mittagsmenu covering classics such as Currywurst and Schnitzel. I tried the Currywurst and was very satisfied - the portion is generous (especially for the ?6,90 price) and comes with fries and some salad. The restaurant is not far from Alexanderplatz, but you have to pay attention for the sign as it's a little bit off the street. Well worth it, and nice cozy interior as well as an outdoor area for those occasional summer days."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,11/12/17,"Visiting a friend in Berlin for just two nights, she looked up places, and we decided on this one. So glad we did! Adorable place, lovely staff that were kind to two Americans who didn't speak English, and most importantly, ah-mazing food! The soups were great, and we got a meal made for two. So much food we took half of it home and had two more meals!"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,3/16/17,the turkey schienzel is so good with the mushroom and fried potato lawdddddd #berlinimmovingin
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,1,6/10/16,"Please avoid this place!It may have the worst knuckle I've ever had in Europe. The pork is so plain that I am not sure whether it is because the cook forgot to add sauce. Besides, it is fat and hard to swallow without good sauce.Another thing is the service. Seems the waitress was too busy to answer my questions (although she was only serving two tables and all other tables were empty). I asked her whether she could help me charge my phone and she said no immediately, although there is power available in the indoor area. Never come back again!"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,11/29/16,Old school not-quite-cool but tasty and definitely gem?tlich with great lunch specials.
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,10/28/16,"Fantastic schnitzel!  The sauce, potatoes and the sauce that came with the order were just perfect with it. Service was really good - friendly and pleasant. She let me sip away my wine without bothering me and allowed me to  have a nice relaxing time."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,2,6/21/15,"I didn't enjoy this restaurant. I ordered pork knuckle which tasted extremely bland. High (for Berlin) prices for below standard food. There are better authentic German food restaurants in the area that are worth checking. 2 stars because the beer was nice."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,5,6/5/16,"Very german, very good food! Nice service and a cosy place to sit, all and all a tue recommender!"
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,10/1/15,"Big portion of food, nice environment, not bad flavor, not the best German food we had so far, overall good experience."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,4/16/15,"A bit hard to find, but very nice and cozy! We had the mittagsspezial, which was ?6,90 a combo. Everything was fresh, so you do have to wait till you get your food. Extra star because the staff was really nice! (But maybe that's Berlin in general)."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,3,5/2/15,"If you want good German food and can tolerate a surly waitress who treats you with contempt, try this place. The currywurst was excellent, so was the Wiener schnitzel -- but the waitress who served us was a real turnoff. There was another waitress there who seemed quite pleasant -- wish she had served us -- it would have been a nicer lunch."
Schl?gl?s,German,4,?11-20,4,2/25/09,"A great traditional place tucked away just off the main drag at Alexander-Platz. Full of character and serving excellent, hearty fare with good beer at keen prices. Very friendly service rounded the experience here off to a T."
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/14/18,If you're in Berlin you MUST TRY this magnificent creperie!  The staff are so friendly and warm. Everything was made fresh to order. The food was fantastic. Loved everything about this experience!!
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/17/17,Really good galettes and crepes but the interior is extremely small and depending on who's working the service can be rather unfriendly.
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/8/17,"Hands down the best Latte Macchiatto I have ever had. The milk foam was like air. Also, gorgeous crepes! I had the apple caramel. I give he presentation alone 5 stars, a cylindrical tower of baked apple which one smashes all over the caramel-drenched crepes it sits upon. A real treat. I'll definitely co.eback to sample the sumptuous looking variety of cakes and quiches."
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/8/15,"In a word - have to review this place again, great atmosphere to start the morning with, yummy crepes and improved macaron collection.Longer version (for the brave) - after the disappointment I've had from the macarons on my last visit long ago, it was time to give this place another chance.So we arrived here on a sunny morning, we have ordered a custom-made cheese omelette for my problematic friend (finally! Not me!)And what a surprise - he loved it.My order was a raspberry crepe that wasn't really an official ""by the book"" French crepe was yummy!After enjoying the nice weather we walked in to pay- and then I saw something that made me happy... They changed the macarons! So instead of having barely three really untasty flavors with a terrible texture there's a wide range of flavors now and they are pretty good! I've had white chocolate with strawberry and guava that were much much much better than the ones they've had before.Happy I've walked in again!"
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/25/16,"Incredible breakfast spot and very reasonably priced. I had the weekly special: a galette with goat cheese, tomatoes, egg, hazelnuts and honey for 5.50?. My friend had a croissant, the freshest orange juice I've ever had, and a ham and cheese omelette for 5.90?. The lady running melt shop is incredibly nice and the cheesecake is unreal."
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/17/14,"Great breakfast close to Junky's Hotel & Apartments! We were tired of the traditional German breakfast buffets of lunchmeats and cheese! This small cafe with about 3 inside tables and 6 outside has an amazing breakfast special for ONLY 5.9Euros- which includes croissant, cafe creme, jus d'orange (fresh!), and omelette (big enough for 2!) Choice of veggie or ham.  The butter/sugar crepe is a little dry but service and food is excellent. The owner and barista is extremely pleasant and cheerful. Be aware to wait for your food. They take their time to make each item one by one with care :) And if they run out of yummy croissants you will have to wait 20mins for them to bake more :)"
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/29/12,"I was walking around with no particularly destination in mind when I spotted a crepe sign....now, I'm a sucker for crepes, and after a HUGE disappointing experience in Paris I decided to check it out....WOW! that's all I can say! firstable, the staff was wonderful, super helpful and friendly! The place itself it's super cozy, they had some tables outside and that's where I sat....I had a quiche, it was really good and they were very generous with the portion size and the ingredients!  It was so good that I decided I had to try something else so I ordered a crepe with apple sauce & caramel....now, this was REAL apple sauce with real apples in it....cinnamon & cloves and oh so fresh and delicious! the best part?!?! the price! it was the cheapest I've had it so far! crepe was 2.50 and the quiche 3.90.....portions were  BIG! I liked it so much that I'm going back tomorrow!! can't wait to try the other items on the menu!!!"
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/9/13,"We wandered into this place looking for somewhere that wasn't serving pizza or cold baguette sandwiches.  We had had enough of German food and it seemed like a cute tiny place we were willing to take a chance on.  Score.  I love crepes and even more so I love savory crepes with fried eggs on top.  This place reminded me of a place I had been in Bordeaux a million years ago.  If you happen to stumble in, you will not be disappointed.  For the single ladies, the young man running the joint was also very cute.  Bon appetite!"
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/31/13,"Great gallants and macaroons.Moderate, humble presentation.Reasonable prices.Integrated service.Five stars."
Melt Caramel,Cafes,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/11/12,"great macaroons, great omelette"
Poveracci,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/23/17,If you're prepared to settle in and have a few glasses of wine if the service is slow you'll have an incredibly flavor filled meal. The black taglioni and scampi was perfect as was the ravioli.  The house red and white wines are just fine.  Who knew I had to come to Berlin to get an excellent Italian meal?!
Poveracci,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,5/15/16,"Super cozy, very friendly, yummy foodA small place, tightly packed with a dozen tables, candle light and reflection of light from the wine bottles on all the walls and the bustle of the open kitchen at the end of the room... This was our initial impression. After being seated, the waiter stepped over, sat down next to us and took the order. Or rather, we spoke about what we wanted to eat. No note taking and no rush; personal with eye contact. We had mixed antipasti plate, a couple of pizzas and a stuffed tortellini from the daily specials menu. All the dishes were delicious, nicely presented, and fairly priced. The ""house wine"" was really yummy too. Will definitely come back"
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/28/17,"So good. Meat was succulent as hell. Ordered lamb chops with fries. We were a table of 7 and couldn't decide on appetizer. They got a platter of all the appetizers yum yum yum. Service was quick and courteous. Plates cleared discreetly. And good recommendations. Slurped my sisters moussaka"
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/4/17,"Went there late, and they ran out of stews. I was told they only have grills, so I ordered an Adana Kebap.Was OK, but nothing spectacular, also missed some salt. The appetizers were great though.I will definitely come again to try the stews since they seem to be the highlight of the place."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/30/17,"Everything super delicious! It's like some lokanta was moved there from one of the streets in Turkey, so authentic. Starter plate with soft white bread is a must!Grilled meat was just perfect, we loved the seasoning and pilav. Simple meals, nice atmosphere and great people."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/9/16,"Great, authentic, home-cooked buffet."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/3/13,"My two companions and I were looking for lunch earlier today. As we didn't want to venture too far, we stumbled upon this place, which was a Turkish restaurant. They don't seem to have a menu; when we sat down at the outdoor table, they told us to come inside and ""look"" at the kitchen, and they just explained what they were cooking that day. For 6,00 EUR, one can get a platter containing one's main dish of choice, plus rice and salad. Some options are more expensive, and has a 1,50 EUR surcharge, which, for that day, applied for the lamb stew. Also, if you want an extra main dish, then the surcharge applies as well.For two platters, we just paid 18,00 EUR all in all, including drinks. The food was tasty, it felt more hole in the wall than restaurant. The clientele are mostly Turkish. And the aura is definitely authentic. This is one of those places that I wish is close to my workplace. I always love these cheap yet very tasty joints, thanks to the diverse population of this awesome city."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/31/16,"Very good turkish cuisine with vegetarian options. They show many ready dishes daily to choose from and also have a menu to order fresh to order dishes. The quality of the food is very high and refined. Surprisingly prices are more than fair with a main dish ranging from 5-13 Euro. From the many turkish places Berlin has to offer this is a true turkish original. Until today one of my favorites was ""Hasir Restaurant"". This one is my new first destination for turkish food in Berlin."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/27/14,"We actually went out of our way to find this place. We'd heard that the Turkish food in Berlin was fantastic and this restaurant had good reviews, so we came here for lunch. We were not disappointed!The waiter/owner(?) was very pleasant. He did not speak English, but with the help of a lady sitting next to us, we ordered exactly what we wanted. (By the way, they do have menus; you have to ask for them.) My husband and I each got a hefeweizen--0,5 liters, which was a bit too much for me, but oh well. My husband got the lamb kabob and I got the beef patties. Each plate came with salad, rice, vegetables, and condiments. The lamb came with grilled bread. The meats were juicy and flavorful. The rice pilaf was excellent: fluffy and well seasoned. And the yogurt sauce... So good!We ended the meal with espresso and Turkish black tea. It was a lot of food, so I don't think we'll be hungry again for awhile. Whether you are in the neighborhood or make a special trip, this restaurant is definitely worth a look!"
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/4/15,"Very good. It was recommended by a Turkish business guy I met that works nearby and said it tasted like the food his family cooks in Turkey. Lunch service is fast because you can pick from an assorted attractive buffet or you can order from the menu. I recommend it. Food tastes very well"
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/2/15,"Had the vegetarian special which was plenty for two to share, plus very inexpensive. Five different dishes on one plate, plus salad and bread. Loved the food, everything was very good."
Sofram,Turkish,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/30/13,"This is an excellent restaurant.The bread, the salads, the meats, and the beer are all outstanding and fresh.Great prices and well located.The service was excellent.The restaurant was very clean including the bathrooms.I really enjoyed the Turkish music being played on the TV and the place was filled with locals.Highly recommend this place and it is a must for anyone wanting to experience great Turkish food."
Osteria Ferrari,Italian,5,?11-20,5,10/26/17,"I went here the other day with my boyfriend who has been looking for non ""German-Italian"" food, specifically from Emilia-Romagna, and he was extremely happy with the entire experience from the food, atmosphere and the service.  Although the place is a bit pricey for Berlin, the work that is required to prepare the dishes exceeds the price that they charge per dish. The only downside from the date is that now he misses home!"
Osteria Ferrari,Italian,5,?11-20,5,11/22/16,"One of Berlin top Italian restaurants. Authentic regional cuisine from Emilia. The pasta is just  out of this world, you will rarely eat this good in Berlin, I haven't tried a single dish in this place that wasn't amazing. I can easily recommend anything on the menu, the homemade Tortelloni, Soli, Cappellacci are all delicious. Not to mention this place has one of the best and more attentive table service in the entire city, which is incredibly refreshing for Berlin. Do yourself a favor and come to visit this place, you will get addicted."
Tapas Espa?a,Spanish,4,?11-20,3,12/31/13,"Acceptable Spanish choice for the area.  Service was very friendly and accommodating, and the tapas menu was big and diverse.  Atmosphere was warm, and a small live band played after 8 pm -- helpfully adjusting the volume as tables filled and emptied and filled again throughout the night, so as not to become unnecessarily loud.Most of the actual food could use a bit of a kick though.  Seafood options were very ""Berlin"" and not coastal Mediterranean -- the ""large shrimps in garlic olive oil"" were smaller than my pinky finger, while the scallops in white wine were the size of small coins.  The croquettas and patatas bravas needed a little more flavor, although the rabbit in red wine sauce was delicious.Disappointingly, all seven or so dishes we ordered came out at the same time, about 30 minutes after we ordered.  Would rather have them come out as they're ready -- surely a spinach salad is ready before a braised meat dish?Will try again -- there's more of the menu to explore and maybe a different line cook will send out the dishes faster on a different night.  Plus, friendly service can be a prized commodity in Berlin!"
Chez Gustave,Cafes,5,Under ?10,5,3/21/15,"By far our favorite spot for food in Berlin. A true French Brasserie in the classic sense.People inside and out with coffee, wind, and a pastry or baguette sandwich.Food was amazing, service excellent, and extremely reasonable. Each sandwich had a very good side salad of mixed greens, tomato, and cucumber with a a light drizzle of  vinagrette"
Chez Gustave,Cafes,5,Under ?10,5,3/21/17,"If you go to one cafe for breakfast it should be Chez Gustav. If you go to two places for breakfast, they should both be Chez Gustaf. Gluten free, celiac friendly, beyond delicious."
Chez Gustave,Cafes,5,Under ?10,4,8/20/14,"Since I didn't bring lunch today, I opted to try out a new place near my work. This one is just one metro stop away, and so I opted to head here and try this place out. It seems that there are quite a few people having lunch, and I was fortunate that the weather cooperated, since the open seats outside didn't have a drape above them. I ordered a Quiche Lorraine, as well as a softdrink. You order at the counter, then take a seat. Your food is delivered to your table, and you pay later after eating.My Quiche Lorraine was well-done and very tasty. It was paired with a light garden salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar and oil. Taste-wise, I would not hesitate to come back here again if needed.There was just a small detail, which makes me want to withhold the final star. I ordered a Quiche Lorraine, but that wasn't the only quiche they had available. They also had a quiche with spinach and goat cheese, as well as yet another variety. My order took a little bit of time to come, because they didn't remember whether I ordered Quiche Lorraine with Speck (bacon), a Quiche Lorraine with Spinach, or yet a third variety of Quiche Lorraine. So someone had to come to my table and double-check, while carrying a quiche with spinach that he was ready to give me in case I said that I wanted it. Here I thought that Quiche Lorraines by definition contained bacon, and not spinach!Anyway, I suppose that's a small wrinkle, since after all, the folks working there don't seem to be from Lorraine."
Chez Gustave,Cafes,5,Under ?10,5,7/23/14,"We are currently staying at the Novotel Berlin Mitte.  My husband found this place in Yelp upon our arrival, looking for a place to eat something decent while waiting for our hotel room after a 10 hour flight.  Our humour changed dramatically when we entered this fabulous little place, gracefully decorated and with home made ""gourmet"" sandwiches and salads (french style).  The prices are very reasonable.  Please don't change this magical place for a hotel restaurant or the more touristy places in Mitte.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  p.s: they serve Lavazza coffee!"
Sale E Pane,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/11/17,"At first I was wondering why my friend was celebrating at this cute little Italian place bit with every course it became more obvious. There is just nothing like eating the food from people who are passionate about their food. The recommendations are mouth-watering, the accompanying wine compliments the food perfectly and all of that paired with positive, friendly service and friends and you'll have an evening you will not forget. I highly recommend to have a chat with the people working here. Due to the size of our group I was able to see all the different dishes from antipasti, truffle pasta (), lemon-prosecco sorbet over the different main courses - fish, HUGE gambas & veal - to an outstanding dessert we covered it all. What a fantastic evening!"
Sale E Pane,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/13/16,We chose this restaurant for our wedding reception and it was fantastic. The restaurant looks wonderful. The atmosphere was very warm and the food was more than perfect. For the starter we had a selection of different antipasti. The main dish was Saltimbocca and pasta and kids had pizza and for the desert we had a selection of different desserts. We also brought our own wedding cake that was even served for us. The staff was very professional and extremely friendly - they really made our wedding day special. All together it was a value for money.
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/11/18,"Every time I come to Berlin, I stop here. Every time, I eat delicious food, drink wine and watch the world go by in Kreuzberg around me. It's great. Every dish I've had here is great and I have no complaints about the wine. They don't mind that I speak English and take my time. Molto bene!"
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/14/17,"Really good authentic italian food, and very friendly and talkative service, which made us feel welcome. We were serviced by the son, very charming.We had both pizza and pasta, and both were really tasty. We were also given a complimentary espresso, and had two big beers, all for the cost of 22 euros, quite cheap also."
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/8/14,"When I saw they had Pappardelle with wild hare on the specials list yesterday, I had to have it. I used to have that dish in San Francisco at my favourite Italian place. It didn't disappoint either, the pasta was fresh, it looked like home-made, the sauce was also perfect, slow cooked rich goodness for 12,50?. The portion was more than sufficient as well. The service was also extremely friendly. I will go back to try their pizzas and lasagne as they also looked very nice."
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/14/14,"The only reason why I'm awarding Martinello with 4 and not 5 stars is the fact that we spotted a busy time and had to wait relatively long for the service. Apart from that - everything perfect!Delicious minestrone, delicious foccacia, delicious starters at really resonable prices. Besides - nice waiters and the cleanest, cosiest, best scented WC ever seen in Kreuzberg :) I will definitely come back!"
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/25/15,"Took my wife and two young children to this place and had an amazing meal. The staff was very friendly, spoke excellent English, and made us feel more than welcome. They offered us a high chair, gave us a little starter to whet our appetite, and then presented us with one of the best Italian meals I've had in Berlin. The price was reasonable, the limoncello wasn't too sweet, and the tiramisu was superlative. What are you doing reading this review? Go out there and get some great Italian food."
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/10/15,Very nice atmosphere and warm. Very kind service. Generous portions for a fair price. Great food. Very much recommended.
Martinello Trattoria,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,4/20/15,"We were a party of 4.  This is surely the worst Italian ""neighbourhood"" restaurant. The owner, a rotund, bored looking man was wearing a dirty white ""T"" shirt, when we arrived and later put on a non descript shirt....I believe someone told him. The food..ah the food !.  We waited for the first courses which arrived at different times, the salad did not appear washed and contained a rubber band (not included on the menu) this was casually removed without an appology or..?  My pumpkin soup tasted as from a can, diluted and served tepid.  I ordered calf liver and specifically requested rare.  What terned out could be used by a cobbler for soles and the soggy chips were drenched in a tasteless brown sauce. The waiter appologised and said that he forgot to tell the chef. The replacement liver arrived, when my company finished their main course....still with the same sad looking soggy french fries...quite cold. I have never had liver to be more tasteless.  My companions ordered spaghetti vongole....the handful of clams in a watery  sauce.  To add insult to injury, we were charged 100 Eur for this the most bizarre experience and have placed Trattoria  Martinello iin spite of its proximity, on a NO-NO list and share this experiencewith our neighbours."
Locanda,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/28/17,"This restaurant is a real gem. It's tucked away just off of kurf?rstendamm. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a good meal. Let the owner guide you and you'll wind up with an amazing, delicious meal in a sweet, cozy restaurant. So far, it's been my favorite place in Berlin to eat."
Locanda,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/30/17,"My friends and I walked by this place after we got off work and decided to stop in. Despite a strong language barrier between the man working and us, we had an amazing meal. He offered to cook us pasta with asparagus, sausage, and other vegetables, and he recommended to me a great glass of primitivo to go with it. He was very kind, and the total for the three of us was ?38. Highly recommended!"
Locanda,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/16/16,"Tasty authentic italian food, been here a couple of times and still loving it.Service is nice and the place is cosy and comfortable."
Locanda,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/14/16,"The chef of this 4 table restaurant is also the host, waiter, bus boy and dishwasher! He cooked a delicious authentic Italian meal and started Us off with a savory antipasti. I had pasta with a ragu sauce that tasted like it was straight from Rome.  My husband enjoyed a meat stuffed ravioli and my son had spaghetti frutti di Mari and also enjoyed his meal. Wonderful ambience, relaxing evening and delicious food!"
Locanda,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/7/14,The food is excellent. I strongly recommend just asking the woman there for a recommendation instead of trying to read the writing on the chalkboard. The homemade pasta is incredible as was the pumpkin soup.
Keb?up,Turkish,4,,5,1/28/16,"Guy working was good, Friendly, and helpful. I got the currywurst and the XL d?ner. Ive had kebab this good only once in my life somewhere in Phuket. This is some humungous 5 star kebab made with passion. Always go for spicy.Currywurst was ok, i had a great one in frankfurt a few days ago so i was spoiled. Get that if youre out drunk and need something to wash down the booze."
Keb?up,Turkish,4,,5,5/5/14,"I am still amazed by how good the doner kebab I had was from here.  (I'm not sure if this is the right location, because I had it from the Keb'up by Checkpoint Charlie.)I'm glad I tried it.  Some of the best doner kebab I've ever had.  The guy who served me was also very friendly."
Keb?up,Turkish,4,,5,9/27/16,"Everything about their d?ner is fantastic. Meat, bread, toppings all great.  I will be back."
Keb?up,Turkish,4,,5,7/20/13,Keb'up is some of the best d?ner kebab in this part of the city.  The d?r?m special (d?r?m cut up as a finger food) is unique and amazing.  The owner is extremely nice and very generous.  He also knows many different languages.  They are one of the few places to get late night food in the area.
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,10/10/17,"Earlier reviews clued us in on this small restaurant and glad they did.  I like to try new places when traveling while my companion is more reluctant.  Both of us very much enjoyed.  There was plenty of food and dishes were well prepared -- fresh ingredients, nice char to the grilled meats and vegetables.  Felt like being invited to a home cooked meal."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,7/5/17,"Hard to believe that this place gets enough business to stay open, but we are glad it is! We had dinner at around 6:30pm.Took my family there based on the reviews here and it didn't disappoint. I had the mixed grill plate and it was amazing. Highly recommend that if you want a place to grab a bite that is a bit different in the flavor profiles you might be used to, then give it a try."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,12/2/17,"Tried multiple plates, everything was very delicious, and the service is always friendly. Just some times they are very slow. I will come back for more."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,9/11/17,"Almost 5 stars, because the food was so delicious. We brought friends from Paris and even they were happy. Few vegetarian options, but they are probably all very good. The place is tiny so you may want to make a reservation."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,7/26/16,"Very good middle eastern food at great value and with friendly service. We ate kebabs and falafel, very good! They offer larger and smaller plates to suit all amounts of hunger."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,4/16/16,"Top-notch food in Berlin. Small, cosy Mesopotamian (!) restaurant recommended by a friend. Walking distance from Berlin Hauptbahnhof, very local, hard to find just by coincidence. Mainly vegetables, amazing taste! Falafel plate with breaded halloumi cheese, salad, sesame-jogurt sauce rocks! So is breaded eggplant with zucchini, peppers and Tomatoes. But not only. They also have poultry, lamb and veal. Not mentioning baklava, which stuffs you completely. But it is worth it. I must be back to try more dishes. Preferably all of them :-)"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,3/5/16,"You'll find this tiny restaurant tucked away with its 2 workers inside. The menu is reasonably short, simple and really all you need. However nothing really can explain the flavour guaranteed with each dish. Shared the falafel plate, Turkey kebab sticks and the chicken dish Malle. The turkey was some of the best I've ever tasted, incredibly succulent. How incredible, mixed with the full glass of Spanish red wine, and garlic bread the large portions really allowed us to enjoy to the full extent. Service personal and efficient, ambiance tranquil leaving a delightful aftertaste when you return to the streets of Berlin.43? for 1 appetizer, 2 mains, 2 glasses of red and a bottle of still water. For the taste and quality of food also means this is one winner of a restaurant!"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,10/20/15,Order the appetizers as entree and you will be very happy. Wonderful mix of textures and flavors. Perfectly sublime. My BF ordered the chicken entree and was disappointed. It was over salted and the couscous was plain and boring. The hummus and falafel plates were some of the best I've had in my 51 years.
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,4/12/16,"Visited on a quiet Tuesday afternoon for an early dinner. The food was amazing and the whole vibe of the place made it even better. Quant, boutique and homely. I Recommend !"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,12/6/14,"This small restaurant serves some amazing food like I have not tasted anywhere. The place is kind of small but we went a little late on a weeknight and had no trouble finding a seat. Also, they only take cash so come prepared or run across the street to the atm.Let me get the average things out of the way. We started with hummus which was a little runny and bland for my taste (though we didn't leave any on the plate) and it came with some great toasted bread but there weren't enough of them. I got the falafel which ended up a little soggy because they were served with that hummus and more unnecessary sauce but they had nice flavor. Okay, now for the raves. Each dish was served with a great salad with an absolutely amazing dressing, citrus and sumac. I got the falafel plate which came with a crisp slice of haloumi, an amazing onion salad/relish (which sounds odd but was delicious), and two sauces in addition to the hummus. We also got the mixed grill which was amazing! Juicy chicken, tender steak, a piece of smokey sausage, something like kafta. The plate also came with salad, sauces, onion relish, bread and fried potatoes. I can't recommend the mixed grill plate enough. Service was polite and the drink list was extensive. There were only a few things that kept this from a five star review but I will definitely go back soon!"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,6/13/16,"Wow!  The high Yelp ratings are there for a reason.  It's a tiny bit off the beaten bath, but is TOTALLY worth the extra walk.  I'm pretty sure the lamb with plumb sauce thing I ordered is the best meal I've had in Berlin so far.  Thank you Yelp...never would have found this place without you."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,7/17/15,"A small restaurant on Torstrasse that offers some dishes packed with flavour. It is a great lunch option if you are in the area, but be prepared to wait a bit on your food. They offer a small selection of changing dishes. I had some saut?ed spinach with figs and olives. A great dish, will certainly go back there and try the other dishes."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,8/22/15,"Best value for money! Food is super tasty and portions are large, too bad they only have little seating inside."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,4/29/15,"Very cozy and tiny nice restaurant! The staff is super friendly and welcoming! The food took a bit long, but the staff gave 2 drinks for free for that and despite that the food was awesome! It was like home made 5 star food with a lot of different interesting spices and prepared from someone who definitely knows how to cook! Its mesopotanian kitchen and I highly recommend the yoghurt soup and the lamb! great experiece overall!!"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,9/14/15,"Good food and reasonably priced. Very small, hole-in-the wall type place that is easy to overlook if not careful. Friendly service. English menus if requested. The one warning is they only accept cash; fortunately I had enough euros on me."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,4/28/15,"The food tasted great, and looked amazing. But past that, the amount of feels this place generates you won't know until you go. So go. Most sure 5 star rating I have given in a while."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,5/28/15,"Really delicious food. We had the vegetables and filo wrapped cheese from the warm tapas type menu which were delicious, and came out hot and fresh. We initially ordered these dishes and then some mains but the waitress kindly informed us that the plates were quite big and that we should order fewer things and see how we go. It was refreshing to have somewhere that wasn't just trying to make money but seemed to care about your experience! We also had a mixed grill to share which was too much food for the 2 of us! But the food was expertly prepared, the marinade on the meat, particularly the chicken, was delicious. Don't be fooled by initial appearances, give this place a try!"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,4,1/6/15,"Cute place, nice and fast service... The food was fresh and tasty. Price value ratio very high... Worth a try and enjoy!"
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,8/5/16,"First time in Berlin and this was our first meal. The next has a very high bar to reach to match Marral Cafe. Outdoor seating was clean, quiet and candle -lit after dark. The falafel appetizer was the perfect mini-meal while we waited for our dinner companion. w salad and hummus accompanying 4 small round falafel, and a pastry wrapped delicious morsel served w delicious bread, it was very satisfying. The English menu was descriptive. We chose to share the grilled plate and chicken skewers among the 3 of us. We still went home leftovers. The grilled plate had delicious meat w grilled pear and apple and tomato w onion relish,hummus, couscous. The English-shy server brought more of the delicious salad topped w a finely grated cheese and spice I didn't recognize. She was quiet, kind and helpful but not comfortable speaking English. This didn't diminish our experience at all. Unfortunately we were the only diners there after 21.30 so they closed when we left at about 22.30. This cafe is best for groups of 4 or 5."
Marral,Middle Eastern,4.5,?11-20,5,1/7/13,"Holla! Es gibt sie noch die kulinarischen Ueberraschungen! Eigentlich kam ich hier nur zufaellig vorbei, mein Blick blieb an der Karte haengen, hier ein Restaurant neu? mir nicht bekannt, sieht nett aus, also rein. Kleiner Raum, grosse Fenster, grosse Heiligenbildchen an den Waenden (eine Ausstellung, wie uns auf Nachfrage erklaert wurde). Ein paar Mittagsgerichte, die bei 3,50 Euro fuer eine Suppe anfangen, ueber eine gemischte Vorspeisenplatte fuer 6 Euro bis zu Lammdingsbums fuer 8 Euro. Da liess sich dann was finden. Vorab gab es eine Tasse Tee aufs Haus, voll war es nicht. Die Bedienung ausserordentlich nett, das Essen kam zuegig. Ich hatte eine Karotten-Orangen Suppe. Die allein war schon fast genug (fuer mich jedenfalls), dazu die Vorspeisen, die aus diversen Pasten, Hummus, Kichererbsenpuree usw. bestand. Plus ein paar Gurken- und Tomatenscheiben (die allerdings nach wenig schmeckten). Insgesamt konnte ich das alles nicht aufessen, es schmeckte aber alles frisch und lecker. Auch mein Kollege, der das Lamm ass, war happy! Alles in allem ein neues Restaurant in der Gegend, was noch etwas braucht, bis es jeden Mittag voll ist aber dann wundert Euch nicht, wenn man hier besser einen Tisch vorbestellt :-)"
Berlin Capital Club,German,5,,5,11/5/12,Without doubt one of the most pleasant places in the city of Berlin. I love to start the day with an appointment in the BCC. As a member of the International Associate Clubs (IAC) you get unlimited access to all areas of the club. This also applies to the excellent meeting rooms. The coronation: the sensational staff. There service is lived. Great!
Berlin Capital Club,German,5,,5,12/21/15,"Fabulously executed Capital Club with first class service, cuisine and their many member amenities.  Best seat in the city on a beautiful night, when you dine at one of their beautiful window tables.  Can't say enough about how they go above and beyond at the Berliner."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,11/4/17,"We made a booking for an early dinner and I was glad we did as it was totally full outside! Lovely huge terrace with shade from the bright sun. We ordered a large range of mezze, mostly vegetarian, plus meat skewers for the meat eaters. Everyone agreed that while the meat was good, the mezze was the real star. Service was friendly and quick, and there was a nice wine list. The only potential misstep was with a dish made up of braised chili peppers. The waiter asked if we were OK with spicy, and our German friend said it would be fine because nobody does really spicy in Berlin. One person ate one, and had tears streaming down their face, two more tried and were soon in pain. Two people said they couldn't taste anything after, so it was good they tried it towards the end of the meal. We suspected it was a case of somehow getting the wrong kind of peppers, since these seemed more like scotch bonnets than padron, but maybe that was the intention. I would avoid that dish, though. Everything else was totally delicious and I would definitely go again when we're in Berlin."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,1/21/18,"If you are down for something special - go and have dinner at FES. Quality of the meat is outstanding, same applies for drinks and the rest of the food. Service is very helpful and friendly and gives you recommendations that fit your needs. Especially recommendable during summer, when you can sit outside."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,7/12/17,"As a middle-eastern woman, I know good middle-eastern food, and this is about as good as it gets! I can't believe restaurants like this don't exist in other places, especially america! The marinades that they use for their meats are SO GOOD (im guessing they put some pomagrante or tamarind molasses in some of them). We tried lamb, beef, and chicken - all delicious. The sides were also SO GOOD. Who knew a spinach dish could be so delicious. They also do a feta mixed with yogurt, which is to die for. Their hummus is the best I've ever had. The whole concept here is great, ambience is beautiful, and the service couldn't be any better."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,11/29/17,"This was our best meal in Berlin! The meats and all the mezzes were perfect and delicious. It's super fun to grill your meat. The place is not very big so I recommend making a reservation (we did it the day before). One of the best parts is also the amazing guys that work there - helpful, kind and funny. Must do if you want a fun experience and great spin on  Turkish food."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,8/20/17,"We stopped in here two nights running without a reservation and were bummed that we couldn't be seated. Finally, we called ahead & got a table for 2...and were super pleased that we had made the extra effort. Service was impeccable, mezze appetizers were amazing (we had hummus, a pureed eggplant dish, and mushrooms stuffed with cheese, plus a large salad)...split a mixed meat platter for the grill as well. Fresh, perfectly spiced, delicious all around, plus a very cozy and welcoming appetizer. Perhaps a bit on the expensive side for Berlin but definitely worth it!"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,1/22/17,Great food and great service! We came here with another couple and had an amazing time. Not cheap but worth every cent.
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,2,8/21/16,"We have dropped by several times in the past hoping to get a walk-in table unsuccessfully, so this time we booked a table for Sunday evening. The restaurant was full, as usual. A glance at the customer demographic was very revealing. By simply setting a grill into each table, they seem to have captured the imagination of a certain group. But does it work....?It's an expensive experience compared to other Turkish grill options and I think that a price indicator of ??? would be more accurate than ??. Our bill for two included 6 mezes and 2 meat dishes washed down with five beers  and came  to ?75.Down to the food. It can't be denied that the Meze are good, perhaps very good. But we agreed that the meat was unexceptional. You cook it yourself on an electric grill set in the table. It therefore lacks any of the flavour normally imparted by a traditional Turkish charcoal grill. All of the meat, which was not of the best quality, was heavily marinated in order to impart flavour and to my mind this concept did not work.In order for a Turkish Grill House to work, you need the skills of a seasoned grillmaster cooking on a good open grill.I really don't think I would return, although Turkish friends have spoken well of it."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,4,6/15/16,"As a person who doesn't eat any meat I still have to say that this restaurant is pretty amazing.I didn't try any of the grilled goods but the meat looked really good. Thick slices, nice marbling and as far as my friends stated: Great flavour. The concept is easy: Grill your own meat. It's up to you if you get a slice of beautiful medium rare steak or a dry piece of gum. With great meat comes great responsibilty.There are zero fish dishes on the menu so if you don't eat meat you have to pick something from the starters. But you what? That's fine because that stuff is all amazing as well. All dishes are prepared fresh and you clearly taste that.I had 4 starters in total with bread and rice and it was great. My favourite is their beetroot salad with walnuts but their hummus is dope as well.Definitely a new favourite!"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,4/28/16,"This place is one of the best places I've been in a while in Berlin.The mezze were spectacular. The meat delicious. Nice atmosphere. Great attentive service with smiles and jokes.MAKE A RESERVATION."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,9/16/16,"Amazing food. Amazing service. Best dinner in Berlin I have had on my trip. Moderate pricing and great quality. Will recommend to friends and family and hope to be fortunate enough to come back to Berlin soon so I can come here agin."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,9/26/16,"Great food, great atmosphere, great employees! Actually ended up coming here twice while visiting Berlin. The owner took time to talk with us and tell us more about the neighborhood. Loved grilling our own food and amazing sides. Would love to come back!"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,10/23/16,"Great service and environment. Delicious wine, small plates, and meat to grill at the table. Excellent spot for dinner and drinks!!"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,3/21/17,"Fes could not have been more accommodating from the reservation to the service. The manager called me personally and arranged extra seats for our party, very rare to get that level of service in Berlin! The quality of the meat and the mezze is also fantastic, without being overly pricey. Would highly recommend for any group looking for a night out in Kreuzberg or to catch up over grilled meat and raki."
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,6/11/16,"Amazing food and service!!! Been there 2 times in 6 months  and both times I was fully satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food. It is a familial restaurant and the brothers waiters are really nice and funny. The sides dishes were heavenly good and the meat was extremely tasty, I would even dare to say that it is the best meat I had in Berlin! Price is a bit expensive for berlin but it reflects the high quality of the service and food in my opinion! I advise you to do a reservation beforehand as they are always pretty full!"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/16,"This was by FAR the best meal I've had in Berlin on my week long vacation. CEM, our gracious host was easily one of the friendliest and best waiters I've ever had in my life. The Lamb was absolutely incredible. 10/10"
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,3/26/16,I am from Istanbul and been living in Berlin since 4 years I gave never been to an awesome Turkish restaurant in Berlin before. The mezes are outstanding and the meat is extremely tasty. Not only the food but the service is one of a kind. You are missing a lot if you havent been here!
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,7/17/16,absolutely delightful evening. full of good vibes and great food. the raki is fantastic. the meat platter was divine and all the sides were fantastic. I'd give this place 4 stars in another dimensions. but the tasty Jams coming out of the house stereo bring this one over the line for a full pelt pentagon. well done fez. you grill like no other.
Fes - Turkish BBQ,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,2/10/16,"Great food, excellent service, thoroughly satisfied. Would highly recommend to anyone in the city. Shared the dinner for two and it was more than enough food. Can't wait to go back!"
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/25/13,"We stumbled in to this cute restaurant, nestled on the corner of a street across from the river. The ambiance looked promising, and a quick peek at the menu - including daily specials - lured us in.We sat outside. The lunch hour was busy but we were able to get a table in the shade. The wait staff are all Italian; they address you in English, Italian or German - as you prefer - and chitchat with each other in Italian as orders are made and delivered. We split a mozzarella di bufala & tomato salad, dressed in olive oil, balsamic reduction & basil leaves. Everything about it was correct - the cheese was perfectly supple, tomatoes ripe, dressing delicious. The house red wine was cheap (?3) and of great quality. I ordered a handmade pasta daily special (?17): spaghetti in broth with Parmesan cheese, shaved truffles & mushrooms. It was heavy but so good that I forced myself to finish. My dining partner ordered the pasta al forno (?8): baked penne in a cheese and red sauce with sausage and broccoli. She loved it. The table next door ordered pizzas; they looked stunning and I'm certain they tasted just as well. Whoever is in the kitchen knows what they're doing.An espresso followed, along with a cone of gelato (yogurt & lemon flavors.... wonderful!). The menu had a wide variety of options - starters, appetizers, pasta, pizza & main dishes. Prices are moderate (?5-12 per dish, more for some specials/meat dishes). The staff were friendly, helpful & did an excellent job (Mario was our waiter... ladies, he's a cutie!). Our total check was ?44 - incredibly cheap for all that we had. The atmosphere transported us out of Berlin and in to Rome for a few hours... what a wonderful hidden gem!"
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,8/21/17,"The food was good, but the waiter charged us extra 4.80 EUR for the credit card purchase, which was somewhat unexpected. Our German friends told us that this behavior is a crime as the tipping is not required, and we should have called the police. Moreover, this big old self-proud ""Italian"" (not at all!) waiter did everything he could to demonstrate that our lack knowledge of the German language is our big mistake, and we are treated as the lower-quality people because of that.Gracias, the place like this teaches us to stop trusting people."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/2/17,"We were there for Valentine's Day. They had a really nice menu prepared for the day with 3 courses for a good price. We started with some bruschetta, then had some delicious pasta with saffron and finished it of with a tiramisu which could have been better for my taste, but since it was part of the menu, was ok.The staff was ok. We had a really nice day waiter who was bringing us the food and also explained quite nicely everything we got. The other staff members were in a bit of a bad mood and we had to wait a while for the bill, but ok.It is a nice place for a special occasion, but I wouldn't come there regularly."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,8/10/16,"Maybe we just catched a bad day of the restaurant, but I wouldn't go there ever again. Besides experiencing a very, very slow service (nothing happened until we called, and we had to many times) the waiters walked around or stood on the street, rather than looking after their ""beloved"" customers and asking if they need something.The mixed salad and the fish salad were tourist-average, okay. But the main dishes were not good - noodles with mushrooms and with edible sea urchin didn't taste well at all. But the real catastrophe was the Pizza. I ordered a Diavolo and asked for extra garlic and rucola.What I got was not hot, had no cheese and some lazy trainee cut garlic into 3 big chunks and threw them on the Pizza, along with old Basil leaves with some rucola. Worst Pizza I can remember! Really ruined my evening!Actually this should be 1 star only as they charged the horrible Pizza even though I complained very clearly about it and they could actually take a look at their disaster Pizza themselves. NOT okay!!In the end after complaining about the charge and waiting more than 15 minutes - there were many italian sorrys and excuses and explanations (""idiots in the kitchen"") - well at least that is something they are always good at... :-)Don't eat there!"
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,8/8/17,Great location and offers an adequate but somewhat pricey menu. Child-friendly which is great for families. Definitely worth a lunch or early dinner on the terrace in the sun!
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,8/21/17,The food was good. But they charged 5 euros because we paid by card. And waiters pretended they don't speak English.
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/16/17,"The food and drinks were exactly as you'd expect from a good restaurant (good ingredients, well prepared etc.--see the other reviews), but what gives this 5 stars from me was the cake for dessert. This was the best cake we've had in a week in Berlin--and we've been looking! Bravo. Another reviewer dissed their tiramisu, and maybe we were lucky and they weren't. That's why I gave 5 stars and they gave 4..."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/12/15,"I really love this italian restaurant, because it is very cozy, very traditional, the food is great: really, everything is just great! The staff is very polite and friendly, the service is all in all superb! In the summer, whenn sittinb outside one has a nice riverview.The price is of coursw corresponding. That is the only aspect keeping me from going less often."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/12/16,"Wow, we had a simple pasta with shaved truffle but darn was it great! The lemon desert (go for the lemon desert, not the lemon ice-cream! Although the latter was good as well) was amazing. Good service and a limoncello on the house to boot."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/2/14,"One of the best places to eat in the Tiergarten area. By accident, it happened to be one of the first restaurants in Berlin I went to for dinner and it is one that I'm happy to return to again and again whenever I'm in the area. It's not only one of the best places for pizza I've ever been to (and I'm a certified pizza connoisseur) but one of the better places to go to for Italian cuisine. The wait staff is always in a good mood and happy to serve. Since Feb of 2014 I've been here 7 or 8 times and have never had a bad experience. I was sticking to the amazing pizza menu for a while - I will never tire of the Diavola pie - but after having a pasta dish from the daily specials and experiencing some of the most tender and delicious cuts of beef to ever accompany pasta I'm now a devotee to the daily specials. I don't think they will steer you wrong. Their sauces are tremendous and if you have a chance to try the chicken stuffed with prosciutto, I highly recommend you do just that. Nothing on the menu costs much more than 20? (I think the most expensive dish I came across was 23?) so you and your lucky companion can get a great meal with a couple drinks for well under 50?. Enjoy."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,6/29/14,"After ordering a cheese and spinach pizza and paying the waiter told us there was no more spinach. They made a different pizza and would not allow us to cancel the order. No refund, no discount.The other pizzas we had ordered weren't bad but with that price I expect better service and I doubt I'll return."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/3/14,"Fantastic, well priced Italian food with excellent service. Complementary starter of soft italian-style bread with chilli olives was very welcome. Pasta and pizza dishes are great value, with big, hearty portions using fresh ingredients at generally no more than 10 euros. The penne arrabiata was particularly good. Best about Casa Matti, however, is the service. Attentive, polite, and courteous - something very hard to find in Berlin."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/30/17,"This place is not hard to find, just follow your Google map. I got there at 5pm on a Sunday night, and I don't have to wait in line to get seated. As I was eating, there were more and more people trying to get in, so try to come early if you don't want to wait in line.Most people would have ordered the baked pork knuckle, but I wanted to try to boil pork knuckle as I've been eating too much friend and baked food lately. The portion is huge!! I couldn't even finish half of it. This is more like a sharing portion to me. The pork knuckle is so tender that it just melts in your mouth. The potatoes are fresh and cook just right! For all of you who wants to try local food, you MUST come!! The price is fair, food are locals and the atmosphere are just perfect."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/3/16,"This restaurant is in the hip neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg.  Before we got there, we were thinking it was going to be a trendy type of bar/restaurant.  We were wrong...in a good way!  It was such a homey feel - like being at your grandmother's house.  There was table cloth on every table with flowers, teddy bears just around, and a bunch of other decorations.  You walk in and just feel like you're having dinner with family.  The staff was so nice and helpful.  We got our food pretty fast even though it was a busy evening (today is German Unity Day...a national holiday).  The apple strudel is definitely a must-have and any potato dish they offer as well (e.g., fritters, croquettes, fries, dumplings, etc.).  This restaurant is definitely recommended if you're ever in Berlin!"
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,4,1/21/17,"For our last day of vacation, my husband and I wanted one last traditional German meal, and --- fit the bill perfectly. It is tucked away from the touristy areas and the ambience is lively, cozy and felt distinctly German - how could it not when the waiter is wearing liederhosen!? The menu is extensive, so it was hard to choose- aside from tons of pork options, they had a few veggie and fish choices. My husband's roast pork knuckle was big enough to feed 4, accompanied by crispy potatoes and kraut. The pork skin was crackly and delicious, and the meat was flavorful cooked perfectly to bring out all its' porkiness. I had the pan fried perch with creamed spinach and boiled potatoes- the fish was well seasoned with a nice crispy top. The spinach was surprisingly light and not too heavy with the cream, and the potatoes were a little boring, but not sure how much you can do to make boiled potatoes exciting. These 2 very big portioned dishes, a beer and a water set is back only 32 Euros. Highly recommended and worth going a little out of the way for."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,8/11/16,I came here with a group of four after searching for restaurants with pork knuckles. The restaurant is very cute. It is decorated with teddy bears and the lighting is very dark. The server was really friendly and tried to help us out when we were trying to decide whether to order pork knuckles roasted or boiled. I ended up getting the roasted pork knuckles and it was delicious ! The skin was very crispy and the meat was tender. The only downside is the location of this place. It is a bit far from other bar/restaurant districts.
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/27/16,"Top notch food and great service. We always try to eat as authentically as possible when we travel, and felt like this hit the nail on the head. The schweinsaxe and schnitzel were both amazing (see the pictures). Tons of food, very reasonable price. Also the interior feels kind of like eating at grandmas place, if my grandma was German. Reservations may not be necessary, but I recommend them. We saw a few parties turned away on a Thursday night, so I can imagine it's even harder to get a seat on the weekends. Staff doesn't speak much English, but that's a positive in my book. Most of the patrons we heard were speaking German and seemed to be local. If you're looking to try a traditional pork knuckle then I highly recommend this restaurant."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,4/5/17,"Like the other reviews here, if you're looking for good traditional pork knuckle, this is the place. I got the roasted pork knuckle (it was huge) accompany with their draft beer. Perfect dinner."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,9/22/16,"In our unending quest for the best roasted pig knuckle and shank, you know, the ones with the crusty, crunchy skin and moist interior, we have settled on Zur Haxe as the only place to go in Berlin.  A quirky restaurant, with stuffed animals and kitsch-y objects both on the bench seats and hanging all around, the waitstaff dress in outlandishly old-fashioned Bavarian attire, but their presentation belies their hip mentality.  The draft beers are cold and delicious, but you won't find many vegetables here besides a mushy sauerkraut and some pretty tasty cucumber salad."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/15/16,"It's been a while since I ate here and I've been delinquent with this review, but I still remember how good it was! We were staying in Prenzlaurberg. After 3 nights of good, but more expensive tourist eats (e.g. Prater Garten), we trekked further afield through quiet suburbs to this little gem, based on Yelp reviews. It's definitely off the beaten path, but well worth the trip. Very comfortable and homey, our family found it warm, unpretentious and grandma's place all the way; a real breath of fresh air. Growing up on Central European food, the Leberfl?dlesuppe, Goulasch, Schnitzel and Schinkenhax were all to die for. Massive portions with unfussy presentation, great service and beer selection in a quaint and fun setting - all that and the bill was a fraction of what we were paying for dinner closer to the city center. Make the trip!"
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,12/16/15,"Great hospitality, and amazing food.It is about 10min walk from trainstation. We arrived at the opening, 4pm, and welcomed by a good English speaking host. Ordered the goulash, cabbage salad to start and shared the pig buckle-14euro, big enough for two to share and we had left over for the breakfast."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,1,5/27/16,"Had their specialties the Schweinhaxen and the Lammhaxen, which was supposed to be crispy, but it was not. It was very salty and not as good as the one I had in another well known restaurant in Munich. It was expensive, very salty, and not delicious at all. To top it all, they don't accept credit cards."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,4/6/15,"This is by far the best place to eat Bavarian food I have ever been to (I also lived in and explored Munich for quite some months). The ""Schinkenhaxe"" is unmatched in size, taste and crunch. All other dishes are exceptionally tasty as well. The guys and girls who run this restaurant are also super cool!"
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/8/15,"Cute restaurant with great food and service. Definitely one of the better meals I've had in berlin. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely check it out!"
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,4,11/8/12,"After half a year in Berlin and visiting several traditional German restaurants I have yet to find a place that beats Zur Haxe, though a few rival it. S?ddeutche k?che at its very best. Prices are affordable if not dirt cheap and servings are generous - I have yet to try their desserts ;)The interior is kitschy but cosy and the staff is dressed in traditional German country attire - Lederhosen and Dirndls. They're friendly and competent and obviously takes pride in providing their guests with a pleasant dining experience. Since the place is a little out of the way it isn't overrun by tourists, but a few find their way here."
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,2/16/15,Very kindly and warm service and delicious food. Very typical Germany traditional restaurant with family feelings.
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/11/14,"I like the atmosphere here, the Haxe and the service are brilliant ! The only problem is that the Haxe is too big for me (male)! Although it tastes delicious , I was unable to finish it no matter how hard I tried. I must say, it's worth to try !"
Zur Haxe,German,4.5,?11-20,5,8/21/13,"On our 3rd day in central Prenzlauer Berg we decided to go out of the way to this charming place, based on the reviews. We weren't disappointed! Food and service were some of the best we experienced during our stay in Berlin at prices about 40% lower than elsewhere. Very homey and warm, they easly accomodated our 3 young children with special orders and coloring. The liver dumpling soup, pork shoulder and goulash...everything was out of this world - real home cooking. Highly recommended!"
Die Feinb?ckerei,Swabian,4,?11-20,4,10/16/17,"I'm so happy we found this place. It's near the David Bowie plaque near his Berlin apartment building. We ordered the special for two since we wanted to sample everything. Be warned it's huge and I would say it's more for 3-4 people. The dish came out on a warmer so that the cheese didn't get cold and the spatzle stayed warm the entire meal. Everything was super tasty. Including the two types of spatzle. This place does not accept credit card so go prepared."
Die Feinb?ckerei,Swabian,4,?11-20,5,8/5/14,"Very good, traditional German cuisine at affordable, reasonable prices. The interior of the restaurant is pleasant and very climatic. Tiled walls remind guests about that here was once an old bakery. On the walls You can find metal posters together with paints. Right at the entrance welcomes us wooden bar with lots of drinks and further are two other larger rooms. Although there is not a computer or wifi, you can pay by credit card. At the start we decided to order broth with noodles pancake (3.5 euros). In order to try as many dishes we ordered also a platter of German specialties for two people (19.90 euros). You can find there Sp?tzle, dumplings, pierogi, cabbage, lentils, sausage, mushroom sauce and salad. Although we love lots of food we were not able to eat everything - it was delicious and serving really great. Service very friendly and helpful. Not intrusive but always at hand. For visitors from abroad is also a menu in English. Very nice and tasty place - would recommend."
Die Feinb?ckerei,Swabian,4,?11-20,4,3/21/13,"I tried a Maultaschen omelette with a mushroom sauce and a salad. It was a lot of food and really, really nice!It does feel like a nice bar with food. I'll definitely go back again. This review was written in 2009.The lunch prices are much better."
Die Feinb?ckerei,Swabian,4,?11-20,5,10/5/08,"Fancy Kneipe, with specialties from Swabia (Baden-W?rttemberg, Black Forest) like Maultaschen, Sp?tzle and more. The location is particularly interesting because of the big old baking oven located in the room at the very end of the restaurant. It is strongly adviced to eat there and enjoy the atmosphere (that room has a capability of about 25-30 persons). Prices are really reasonable (10-30 Euro). Each month there is an all you can eat day, based on sp?tzle variations. highs: taste, price, atmosphere lows: lots of fat my favourite: vegetable maultaschen with spinace sauce and cheese crust"
Die Feinb?ckerei,Swabian,4,?11-20,4,11/17/07,"From the outside the Feinb?ckerei looks tiny, but once you walk in it goes back and back to a very child friendly dining area. There are books, toys and crayons to amuse your little ones so that you (hopefully) can have a little time to yourself while eating. My only complaint about the restaurant was that the menu was a little limited, however I was more than happy with my choice of pork in a mushroom sauce served with Sp?tzle (Swabish noodles)."
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,8/16/16,"My friend and I decided to check this place out for our first night in Berlin. We went early - right around opening time, and we were seated immediately. The smell was intoxicating. The owner was super friendly and he made a beer recommendation for our meal. When the food arrived, we were in awe. How can something taste this good? I got the veal goulasch with bread dumpling and my friend got the beef goulasch with potatoes. Like any good meal we have together, once we begin eating, we don't speak again until our plates are completely clean. This time, I'm not even sure if I stopped to take a breath. The music selection could not have been better. I can already tell I will be sad when I leave Berlin. I plan on returning here for another meal before I leave. We even took a few jars to go. They are in the fridge near the entrance.  I live in New York City where, for better or worse, it is possible to get almost any cuisine. During my recent tour of Europe with my buddy, we have had the pleasure and privilege of sampling authentic cuisines from some of our favorite places. This experience was among the best in both Europe and NYC. I highly recommend you eat here if you have the chance. You'll be happy!Thank you!"
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/30/16,Absolutely delicious food and wonderful cook/server/host! It's a one man show but he is excellent at his job and makes sure his customers are well attended.
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/17/16,"My husband and I stumbled upon this cute little restaurant while we were looking for a place to get some genuine German grub. This was absolutely perfect! It's very small inside - can probably only seat 20 people max. There's a tiny bathroom in the corner and then the kitchen/bar area where the guy (Gah! We should've asked for his name!) mixes drinks, cleans, AND prepares food. He is a one man show!I'll admit I haven't had a lot of goulasch, but man, if it always tasted like this, I am a HUGE fan - the lamb was absolutely delicious and I have been craving since we've been back in the states. I definitely recommend going out of your way to eat here. It is just adorable and the area is great and lively at night too."
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,4/13/16,"As a Hungarian, I can say the Goulasch has very little to do with what most Hungarians consider Goulasch (Guly?s). On the other hand it is amazing! I'm definitely going back for more. The beer selection is also excellent, don't miss out on this place.By the way, the whole place has about 3 tables, so be early or make otherwise sure you get a table."
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/11/17,"Excellent goulash, flavorful, meaty and heartwarmingly delicious . Friendly and witty service, great location right on lovely Chamissoplatz Park, good wine - really enjoyed my meal. Will be back many times especially as the weather turns to fall"
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/14/15,"Is there better Goulasch? No, not really; this is the best goulasch in Berlin.The menu is small, but so is the restaurant; it is charming and quaint while at the same time spectacular: the beer is some of the best available, anywhere, and the food is spectacular. (Even the music choice is top notch!) You will love it!"
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,3/22/16,"Incredible food, atmosphere, and service at this place. Small two-table floor with bartop space, the owner and sole chef cooks everything himself right on the spot. Traveled multiple countries over the last two weeks, this place was by far the best. Unreal. Make sure to get a reservation, we got lucky."
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,9/5/15,"Best Goulash outside of rural Hungary. Additional points for service, presentation, and quality of ingredients. Also, Amazing Beers! !!"
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/24/15,I was really happy to stumble on this place in the cold month of January. Both the food and the service were excellent and came with good Belgian beers!
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/29/15,"I am a vegetarian and I love G wie Goulash, though there's usually only the salad and the vegetarian goulash I can eat.  like many other locals, I come back again and again because it's such a super gemuetlich place, offers (tiny) tables both in sun and in the shade, and the servers are always incredibly friendly, accommodating, and honest.  The menu and the drinks list are short, simple, and excellent."
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,5,2/19/11,"This restaurant is more than just food. It is a declaration of intentions. This is what a ""Kiez Restautant"" must habe been.Nevertheless the food itself is simply fantastic and genuine.Highly recommended, except if you are a tourist.(we want to keep the reduced ammount of tables for us, the locals)"
G Wie Goulasch,German,4.5,?11-20,4,1/8/10,"Excellent food, cozy place. Worth noting that there is no typo here: the URL is correct above: ""g-wie-gulasch.de"" but the actual name of the restaurant has the ""o"" in it ""g-wie-goulasch""."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,8/25/16,"Yes....!There's really not much to say about Meyan, because in total honesty, what do you say about a place that seemingly has it all? I was looking for a vegan/vegetarian-friendly place to accommodate my special out of town guest, and Meyan more than delivered.  The ambiance of the hole in the wall is beyond special.  The colorful plates, eclectic cushions, and bright flowers create a cheery and joyful environment, which very well complements the nature of the food--the flavors are bright and bold, yet fresh and surprisingly light! We ordered the chicken salad, the hot eggplant signature dish, and 3 small sides of beetroot hummus, baba ganouj, and a carrot walnut spread.  Needless to say, we were hungry. The chicken was battered with sesame seeds and, despite being fried, was extremely light and fragrant! The seeds paired beautifully with the slightly-sweet-yet-slightly-acidic housemade dressing. A beautiful salad that was beautifully portioned, dressed, and seasoned! Hurrah! The eggplant in the signature hot dish was saut?ed with onions, tomatoes, paprika, and olive oil... A flavor bomb if you can imagine one... Deliciously satisfying and again, very well portioned. This dish, I believe, also came with a basket of house made bread! Put the words home made and bread together, and you can definitely count me in every single time.However, the star of the show? The spreads. If you can, try them all. I haven't had a bad time with one... If your stomach or resources are limited, here are my suggestions:If you like beetroot, the hummus is a must! Slightly sweeter than your classic chickpea hummus, this spread was divine on the nuttier bread! Speaking of divine, the carrot-walnut spread came in close as the overall favorite.  It was slightly sweet, yet savory, and immensely texturally satisfying with the carrot and walnut chunks. The baba ganouj was your standard. With that being said, however, the standard at Meyan is set exceptionally high. It's quality. Meets quantity... The best of both worlds, really. There's really not much more to say... If you don't believe me, definitely swing on by to check it out for yourself!"
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,1,8/26/17,"All I can say? ""No bueno"". The prices were INSANELY HIGH for the portion size. And the food itself? Nothing to write home about. The service (at least one waiter in particular) was neither friendly nor obliging...he even LAUGHED IN MY FRIEND'S FACE when she asked a question about her order. This definitely a culinary experience NOT WORTH REPEATING."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,12/29/15,"It's been a while since I checked out a new place. The opportunity presented itself yesterday, when I needed to get something to eat before watching a play, and so I looked at my list of bookmarks and saw this one. I've known this place existed for a while, but just didn't have the time to check it out.Anyway, so I went. And ordered the vegetarian platter. It's a nice mezze plate with spreads, mushrooms, beans, and dips, served with bread. Oh that was wonderful. Next time I'll try their other dishes.The other nice thing with this place is the atmosphere. There is adequate seating area both at the front and the back, and they even sell all the dishes and plates they have. This place has charm. It is not your run-of-the-mill Turkish place. Perhaps the only confusing thing is the presence of the counter with food displayed in it. Is it a cafe or a deli? Do you order at the table or at the counter? It doesn't really matter, really, since however you do it, the food is great.I'll be back and try some more good stuff from here."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,4/7/16,"The best Feinkosten restaurant in the city. Its medeterian very friendly service service, very delicious food and very tasty coffee."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,3/19/16,"This is one of my beloved place in Berlin! The food is amazing and the vegan and vegetarian choice is huge! Many paste and turkish ""tapas""? Mezze? Their plates and cups are so cute and you can even buy them there.It's the restaurant I bring all my friend who visit me here too!"
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,5/5/14,"Meyan - S?ssholz, what can I say about this place? First of all it has to be one of the friendliest most welcoming places to walk into!  This family run business is a refreshing addition to a street which is already bursting at the seams with various cafes and restaurants.From the moment the doors opened for the very first time, this Turkish Deli has flourished a clear sign of satisfied customers.  I watched for months as this place was being renovated to see what would appear... Well talk about Turkish delight!By this I am not only referring to the food but also the owners Ali, a former actor and his beautiful wife ?i?dem who was previously a fashion designer. Their attention to detail is applaudable. Service is fast and attentive. As a guest you feel well looked after. The space is very comfortable and harmonious, not at all cramped. You can sit at one of the many wooden tables with your laptop quite happily and still feel that you have your own privacy. Books are also provided (In German).  The double fronted windows open up in summer, so if you can't find a seat outside you can take what was previously a window seat! In winter it's just as cosy, so a good caf? to go to all year round.All that aside, does the food live up to the service and surroundings? YES in my opinion!On entering Meyan you are immediately confronted by a vision of exquisite nibbles enticing you from behind the huge glass vitrine. Choose me, choose me!  Well the good news is that you don't have to disappoint the little morsels; you can choose more than one! Just tell them what you want and they will make up a plate in tune to whatever your heart desires.It would be crazy for me to recommend any one thing here as it really is all quite delicious. It is impossible to come here just for a coffee and not feast your eyes upon the goodies on offer. Even I have to look twice each time I visit. There is a great deal of choice in dips, spreads, salads and other Turkish delicacies not to mention the daily specials. If you still have room left, you can try one of the Turkish desserts or cakes on offer.See photos to get what I mean! I would say if you have never tried a Turkish coffee than give it ago here. Some places make it too thick or too watery. It's just right here, for me anyway!Perhaps you just fancy a glass of wine with a few nibbles for a light supper. Meyan not only serves Turkish wines but also offers a selection of German, French and Italian wines too!The good thing is NOT only can you take the food home with you, but you can also buy the plates, dishes and other goods. Like home-made soaps from Donkey's milk, I'm not sure about its beauty advantages but judging by the looks of the family and their gorgeous kids, I think I might have to start using it! They also sells scarves, home-made preserves, herbs, teas and selection of wines, perfect for if you are going off to a party, drop in and buy some wine and tidbits to take a long.Speaking of Parties, Meyan also caters on and off site and is available to rent out for private functions."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,4,6/18/16,Friendly corner deli feel. Great service and a nice sized menu of small dishes/tapas like items.
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,2/1/14,"I used to love Berlin a lot but since I left it and moved to a dreamlike cutest little city in South Germany I don't miss it too much. I don't miss it unless I come to visit it and discover treasures like Meyan. This little cafe opened recently (guys, why didn't you open it two years ago as I lived just around the corner???) in a street where every second entrance leads you to a nice bar, cafe or a restaurant. Still if I would walk down this street now and then I would go there and only there.Imagine the combination of three factors: LOVE, TASTE and CREATIVITY, and you get an approximate description of Meyan, which by the way means liquorice. LOVE stands for the interior design, delicately oriental and elegantly urban at the same time. You can't oversee that every single thing has been selected, no, chosen with love. There is something old, and something new, and something handmade, all together creating an absolute harmony. East meets West, personal meets urban, vintage meets modern. TASTE stands for the yummy food, so fine and spicy at the same time, accompanied by a black tea in narrow-waisted Turk glasses or a nice glass of wine. CREATIVITY comes from people that run the place, open, friendly and authentic. You come in, you greet them, you chat, you feel welcome... What can I say more? Just go there and see for yourself. And if you like it as much as I do, you can take one little bit of Meyan home: just buy a colourful oriental bowl or a handmade soap. The second would support a women project in Turkey. Good for your hands, good for your inwit."
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,4,10/21/16,"Great ambience, good Turkish cafe food. Did not disappoint"
Meyan,Turkish,4.5,?11-20,5,3/9/14,"Sun-Rabbit Q's review sums it all up perfectly, but let me just second it...when I moved to Berlin, i was happy to find so many little turkish feinkosts, with delicious flatbreads and spreads in the vitrine - mostly, though, these places have been take-out places for me, lovely spots to pick up fixings for picnics or for home, but not places to linger, mostly because the seating + atmosphere never really invited me to stay for longer periods.in contrast, everything about Meyran is inviting - my friend and i were drawn to it just from the mood of people lingering out front and the cosy caf? and giant vitrine visible through the huge front glass.  we ordered a simple array of spreads and sides from the several W?nschteller options and an order of kizartma (a warm salad of sorts of roasted eggplant+pepper with yogurt), and were honestly immediately convinced to be return customers on the very first bite of the latter (i'm serious!). it was all brought together with perfect wine recommendations from the staff and lovely crusty artisan bread, a nice little reimagining of the right dipping bread for this style of food.the artful preparation of our small meal and all the little design elements of the caf? (look on the walls for the clever use of the cut, 'left-over' portions of the tables), speak to the owners' deep attention and care for details, but this is also clear from the friendly attention we received from the owners throughout our slow, lingering dinner. i get the feeling they've really considered every step of a welcoming, inventive and delicious meal, and i'm already looking forward to the next visit.(for another really nice and accurate write-up of Meyan, check out: http://tuerkiz.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/meyan-meine-ganz-personliche-susholzraspelei/)"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,3/4/17,"This was so much fun.Came super early for sat dinner.The music was great but impossibly loud, as in don't even attempt to talk to anyone including the waiter unless it's between sings ( also why I deducted a star). Note: we were not super close to the stage.Had the Schnitzel and it was delicious. Swamped out potato salad for their mashed potatoes, which were also great. Came with a small cucumber salad which I did not enjoy."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,6/14/17,"In all honesty, I would not go here for the foot. We had pizza here and were not that impressed. The place however is really nice. Sitting outside in the garden is very cost, and eating inside during the dance classes is (a bit noisy but) very much fun! Lastly, the service is good and fast. They brought the wrong drink but immediately replaced it. )"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,1,8/12/16,"Worst service I've experienced in Berlin. They are understaffed for the patio outside and the waiter tries to rush everyone to order. There is one main waiter who takes most of the orders and he is ridiculously really RUDE.He came to our table with the menus and he was talking really fast when he was answering our questions for the beer. We placed an order for food and my friend ordered a drink for himself but I wasn't ready to order a drink yet so I said ""I'm still looking at drink menu"". The waiter then collects all the menu including the menu from my hand. He literally snatched the menu from my hand .. I was shocked since I said I am still looking ... Stay away from this place or else it might ruin your day."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,8/30/16,"We were seated as a large group in the back garden, very quiet and decorated nicely with colorful, strung lights above. The group was overall very satisfied! I had the water buffalo meatballs with potato salad, and the baked camembert as a starter. Both were flavorful, particularly the meatballs! As an exciting side show, there was a ballroom dance class taking place inside (Tuesday night) which is enough of a draw to come back with a partner and learn something!"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,10/3/16,"As an American traveling in Germany, this place had everything I was looking for in a beer garden.This place is massive and has a variety of seating options inside and out. There's a dance hall in the middle which was pretty lively with a variety of people.Service was decent. On a Saturday night my party of 5 was able to get seated fairly quickly and the service was more attentive than most places I visited on this trip.The menu isn't huge but there are daily specials and a decent spread for different kinds of diets. Didn't drink the beer but the others I was with seemed to enjoy it.Overall this is a cool place for all age groups, and a nice place to sit and have a couple drinks or just see some nightlife."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,5,5/14/17,"Incredible food! We had the duck and watermelon appetizer and the best gnocchi I've ever tasted. The decor is kitschy with garland, a disco ball, a chill black cat and people dancing but that just added to the enjoyment in my personal opinion."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,3,3/5/16,"This place is a fusion of a chic restaurant and an 80's night club. You will often find 50-60 year olds shaking it to the tracks of Billy Joel and Bon Jovi. The food is great though, and so is the wine."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,7/2/16,Cozy backyard garden with an restaurant and dance hall. Fantastic atmosphere and worn out buildings ala post war Berlin. A hidden oasis in the center of the town.
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,1,8/4/17,Super shit service. Rude waiters. It's a nice looking place but I'm not German and I can't get over the bad service.
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,7/27/15,"We wanted to go to a biergarten and I'm glad we came here.  I had probably the best meal in Berlin here.  Our group ordered a foccicia pizza, salad, beef dish, sausage and I got the schnitzel.All our food was prepared very well.  My wife's pizza and salad were excellent. The beef dish and schnitzel were also delicious.  With the atmosphere of eating a terrific meal outside in the biergarten, how can you not just enjoy the vibe of being in Berlin?"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,6/23/16,"Really cool old venue with nice outdoor seating. It started to rain after dinner so we moved inside. They have a cool covered outdoor area in the back as well. Lots of people dancing to old swing music. Interesting vibe. The weiner scnitzel was very good, the beer was okay. Good spot!"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,5/28/16,Lovely garden and casual atmosphere.  Great pizzas and schnitzels.  Efficient  service!
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,3/8/16,"We didn't have reservations but they accommodated us anyway. Schnitzel the size of your plate, potato fries to die for and delicious beer. We happened to come on a night where they were teaching couples dance lessons. It was fun to watch the different styles of dance. They also seemed to open longer than many other places in the area. If you have the opportunity I would suggest getting a lesson. The instructors seemed charming and like they knew what they were doing."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,3,4/30/16,"This is an odd place... not for everyone... and then Again, it might be just what it is, FOR everyone! The night I was there it had a great mix of couple in their 50's-60's, young people in groups, a grandpa kind of guy and then me and my friends, and of course a Whole bunch more between age 18-70 :)a mix between live band and a DJ made sure that the dancefloor was packed and busy. It is definitely an experience, and I'll come back maybe next time I'm in Berlin."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,6/6/17,Lovely place and the food is delicious! I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Been twice and looking forward a third time :)
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,5,3/29/15,"On a cold but sunny Sunday afternoon, we ended up here and we had a great time. I was here once before during a hot summer night, when we ended up having drinks in the garden. This time we ended up inside in the middle of a dancing session. It was a wonderful experience to watch the broad variety of people dancing and having a blast. We got a table exactly at the spot where the sun entered the dance floor, which gave a super pretty ad dreamy view of  the people dancing (see black/white pictures).The food was good as well, the wine and beer Ok. The prices are average, definitely not cheap, but worth it! The focaccia and olives were very tasty, same as the french cheese we ordered. The rocket salad was a bit boring, but refreshing nonetheless. We saw some Schnitzels passing and I have to say those looked delicious so I might be going back for those!Make reservations when you plan on going here, we were lucky to get a table!!"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,3,7/20/15,"While in Berlin, my friends and I wanted to visit a beer garden and opted for this one because it was relatively close to museum island. The large outdoor space is lovely with overhanging string lights and facades of brick with ivy covering them. When we initially ordered, our server seemed taken aback that we were only getting beer even though there were plenty of other people who had just gotten drinks. While the drinks were promptly brought out to us, we had to wait a very long time for our server to return and in fact had to flag him down. He was quite rude when we were paying the bill and unfortunately made our experience less pleasant. If the service had been of a higher quality, I would give it a higher rating for sure."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,5,12/2/12,"This is a review of the Mirror Hall (Spiegelsaal) in Cl?rchens Ballhaus only. I attended a Sunday evening concert here, which happened to be a piano recital of Evgenia Rubinova. It was my first time attending an event in here, so I didn't know what to expect. Upon climbing a flight of stairs, lit by candles, I was greeted by the person behind the ticket desk. I paid my entrance fee of 10 EUR, and found that the hall was already slowly being filled with people. The recital starts at 7 PM, but the door opens at 6 PM. There is a bar that serves drinks before the recital, as well as during the intermission. The Mirror Hall is this time capsule, a hall that clearly shows its age. The management opted not to renovate it and instead keep it as is, which in my opinion, is cool. That's what keeps Berlin weird and interesting, in my book. The whole hall is pretty much candle-lit, with the exception of a few spotlights carefully positioned. The seats seem like they're all second-hand, bought in a flea market. And the mirrors are broken, and the walls are chipped. I actually thought that if hipsters decided to hold a classical music performance, then this would be the result. They would hold it here, in the Spiegelsaal, not in some swanky and sterile concert hall. So there, 5 stars for the awesome venue. I loved it, and enjoyed it, and I haven't even reviewed the performance."
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,4,10/18/14,"I came here around 4pm on Monday with a friend I made from a walking tour.  I was so happy to eat here be chase I ha learned some things about this historical landmark from a different walking tour!Between my friend and I, we had:HOMEMADE WATER BUFFALO MEATBALLS w/POTATO SALAD - ?8,60ROASTED BEEF with Onions served with Peas, Beans and Bacon and mashed Potato - ?16,70Between the two, I enjoyed both meals quite well enough.  I didnt feel it was anything extravagant or that special, but the atmosphere was nice and it filed my empty belly.The place was empty because it was definitely not dinner or dancing time yet.   This place is HUGE and the staff was quite friendly...I'm sure they get plenty of tourists that come here.  We enjoyed and finished out plates!"
Cl?rchens Ballhaus,German,4,?11-20,5,7/6/15,"The food was fantastic, well worth the money. Dining outside and people watching  was a treat. After your finish there is a small ice cream shop a cross the street you can try. A nice evening out. An experience i willNever forget during my holiday stay"
Der Th?ringer,German,4.5,?11-20,5,2/24/17,I have been traveling through Germany and this is the best German restaurant I've been too! The bratwurst were amazing! The staff was incredibly friendly. Would definitely come back.
Der Th?ringer,German,4.5,?11-20,4,8/4/17,"They are selling some of their bratwurst outside in a stand, but I decided to go inside the restaurant and have a nice sit down meal. I had the Rostbratwurste and Banana Juice here and both were decently good.The Rostbratwurste was good, especially with the potatoes and sauce, and the sauerkraut balanced out the dish nicely. It also helped that they provided a heaping serving of mustard, so when I got tired of the taste, the mustard provided a good refresher to clear the palette a bit and it went quite well with the bratwurst."
Maranda,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,7/21/16,"Maranda serves excellent authentic K?fte kebabs, cutlets, liver, sardellas, fish and other turkish delicacies that you don't get in any D?ner kebab corner store. The food is freshly made to order (and has not been over fried for hours on a turning skewer like in some D?ner stalls), well seasoned, the sauces are good and the bread soft.The prices are reasonable: 3? for sandwiches, 6? for a plate full of fried sardellas, 10? for a whole grilled fish.The guys behind the counter are friendly.Maranda is more than one of 1000 regular turkish fast food stores in the Kiez and definitely one of the best in their field! I love coming here and can recommend it to anyone!"
Maranda,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,9/22/16,"Omg omg omg everytime big flash so great so nice!!! Everybody shouldve tried it out once in his/her life!K?fte sandwich! Its also easy better than mustafas gemuse abfuck :) love you"
Maranda,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,7/10/16,Great meat in great price! Try the k?fte sandwich with an ayran ;) the service is very friendly and the locals are really into it. If you are more adventurous go with the liver sandwich! Authentic turkish flavour!
Maranda,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,10/31/16,"Very underrated place. Most delicious k?fte and Adana d?r?m in Berlin. Salat and daily dishes are ""must try"". I always have to make detour to arrive here but it's worth it :)"
Espanol Don Quijote,Spanish,4,?21-40,5,10/7/11,"My family has gone to this restaurant for 3 generations! The service is super, the menu offers a wide range throughout Spanish cuisine. I love the Sopa de Ajo! Best I ever tried. Of course I will be back soon again!"
Espanol Don Quijote,Spanish,4,?21-40,3,8/19/15,"Staff was friendly, food was nothing more than average! A little bit overpriced, not worth the $$$. Nice location, easy to find, but u only go there once!"
Espanol Don Quijote,Spanish,4,?21-40,1,1/11/13,"Visited the restaurant with a friend couple who recommended it and said the food was always great.Must have been an off night, because even my friends were disappointed. I can only talk about the experience me and my partner had.The restaurant itself is nice and the hostess was really friendly. The menu looked pretty good too. I ordered calamari and my partner salmon. Both portions were huge disappointments, both looked weird, even repulsive. The calamari was swimming in brown goo, the salmon hidden under brown stuff, mostly nuts. The only taste in the calamari portion was of salt and chili. The salmon was tasteless.As said, this may well have been an off-night, but by the experience I had I can not recommend the place nor do I have any interest to give it a second try. There are just too many decent restaurants in the city, that do not disappoint."
Espanol Don Quijote,Spanish,4,?21-40,3,3/16/13,"Well this is a difficult place to review, when I arrived at this Restaurant it was empty and I thought twice about entering but Berliners do start late I thought. That did turn out to be the case as the Restaurant filled up not long after our arrival. The restaurant itself was comfortable and clean, as were the facilities. The food was cooked very well and the menu had some interesting choices. I tried the Suckling Pig and some Paella, both of which were really very nice but somehow neither blew me away. Perhaps my expectations were too high or Spanish cuisine is just not for me but I definitely was not overwhelmed by my experience in this place. The staff were friendly and nice although they served us Spanish beer that was pretty flat and told us it was usual for this type of Beer... well not in my experience, Flat beer is flat beer and everyone knows the brand of Spanish beer they serve, that was disappointing . All in all an ok place but quite expensive and watch out for flat beer."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,1/6/16,"This was our best experience we had in Berlin.This tiny place with the kitchen almost side by side with the tables. I Think there is room for six small tables so book your reservation in advance. We choosed the meat meny and everything tastes delicious and very flavourfull. The sevice was in top. We asked for wine by the glass and they helped and recommended wine that tastes really good with the food. The price is in the lower range for a michelin star restaurant. I would come back.If you're on vacation give yourself the pleasure and try this place."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,7/2/17,"Went here on recommendation of hotel front desk. What a wonderful recommendation! Only table available was outside but weather was nice and we were only ones sitting out so it was like a private dining experience. The menu consisted of two different 5 course meals, one emphasizes fish and the other meat. We ordered each and added the 5 course wine paring. Each dish was fantastic. Presentation was beautiful and the wine pared perfectly. Staff was super attentive (especially for Europe) and extremely knowledgeable, polite and friendly. Know that this is not a quick place to eat but the trip to flavortown is worth the journey."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,4,11/12/16,"Food was inventive, service was delightful, but the pours were anemic. For the price of the tasting menu, I think a bit more generosity with the pours would really raise the bar for this place."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,6/7/15,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary dinner here. We both love creative food paired with interesting wines so the opportunity to have both tasting menus (12 different courses with 12 wines) was right up our alley. The presentation was gorgeous, the juxtapositions were always interesting and several were truly inspired. We had a number of small distribution wines we've never even heard of before. The sommelier / waitress was excellent - with an impressive bilingual ability to explains the food, the wine and the philosophy behind each plate. Great food and a super chill atmosphere (no pretense). Thanks to Berlin Food Stories blog for the tip."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,4,10/5/15,"I had the meat-centric 5-course menu with wine pairing and a main course to get a good sampling. Our friendly hostess & server described each plate and wine along with tasting suggestions (essentially to get all the ingredients in one bite) Everything tasted great, and although the wines alone did not exactly meet my usual desired flavor, they perfectly complimented the dish, especially the dessert wine pairing. Overall a very enjoyable taste excursion!"
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,2/15/12,"Before I can review Bandol sur Mer, I have to write a mini-review of Germany's attitude towards Valentines Day.  Most holidays feature one of more of the following: family obligations; fasting; or Jesus.  So basically, they are, actually, kind of a drag.  On the other hand, the basic premise of Valentines Day is: pick somebody you like and then do enjoyable things with them.  Why is this not a popular Winter holiday in Germany?  I can understand skipping Yom Kippur but not Valentines Day.Anyway, I mention this because I was a little mystified why it was so easy to get a reservation for Feb. 14, after I totally whiffed late in December.  Second, Bandol sur Mer is cozy, and everybody except for one couple was speaking English.  It was like being back in the ancestral homeland, except for the part about public transit taking you there without much hassle or danger.On to the food: on offer were two prix fixe menus, one of which was friendly towards fish-dairy-only eaters.  Some standouts were the mackerel small plate, the veal tartare, and the modernized ""mushy snap peas"", but the courses were solid up and down, with enough time in between (we were there from 9-12 = 21-24) to not feel overly stuffed.I'm not sure who is classifying it as ?? instead of ???, but you won't feel ripped off either.  Highly recommend, and will return once in a while."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,4,5/29/11,"It's a quick walk on Torstrasse from the Rosenthaler Platz station. Excellent food and ambience and most definitely worth a visit. Very unpretentious French, but slightly overpriced, although if you go easy on the wine, you'll be ok.The entrecote is not to be missed and the veal is paradise. If you've been missing seafood, the squid with scallops will tempt you to get another portion (although I must say, portions are very fair). Their selection of wine is perfection (5 bottles between the three of us)."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,3/19/14,"I had a phenominal meal here last Saturday. This is a cozy little restaurant that features some amazing cuisine.  If you are looking for a normal menu and large serving sizes-- This isn't the right restaurant for you.  They create a gourmet experience for you using a lot of new techniques. Here it's about the variety and complexity of the flavors.  They offer things two ways-- You can pay individually for the menus items, which adorn the chalkboards around the restuarant, or you can choose one of their multi-course menus. If you do it this way you'll get a lot more value for your money. They also offer wine pairings- which I partook of.  The place is very small, with only 6-8 tables that seat between 2-4 people, and the kitchen is open and in the same room, so you are inundated with amazing smells as your food (and your fellow diners) is prepared.Let's start with the service- Phenominal. The waiter was professional, friendy, and described each dish like he was the chef as he presented it. He worked with me to help me pick out the right choices, and fully explained the reasons why he chose he wine pairing for each dish as if he was a Sommelier (which he may have been).  His knowledge was extensive on both the food and wine, and the flavors of each and how they would interact.  I could not have been in better hands. The dishes features aromas and flavors that were very complex but perfectly paired-- such as the Rabbit (cooked perfectly) served with mussels, langostino, edamame, and thinnly sliced chips of crispy blood sausage, all with a dense, luscious broth of intense buttery flavor made from the mussels and lord knows what else. This broth was easily one of the single best things I have ever had and I ended up pouring the remainder of it directly into my spoon and drinking it down.  The chefs also do an amazing job of incorporating dollops (spheres?) of pureed vegetables like roasted orange bell pepper or a dense, yet sweet tomato paste/puree (that was anything but tomato paste), or Parsnip... They had one dish that had Onions served three different ways- and one of the ways was a delicate sweet foam. If you like great food and wine, you should come here. You'll drop a lot of Euros, but you'll leave very happy with an experience, not just a meal. You don't have to dress up to dine here- but you'll feel underdressed in comparrison to the service and food you are being given. It's a GREAT place for a date. Probably not a good place for small children as it is high cuisine."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,4,4/7/12,"I don't review many places so for me to take the time to log-in and review this location says a lot. I was in Berlin on business and went to this restaurant 2x as the food was just that good. I had the entrecote which had such great flavor, grilled scallops and the bouillabaisse. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The wine selection could be a bit better but other than that, I really liked this place."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,3,3/6/11,Long waiting time and overpriced dishes. Service was very friendly and competent. Food was tasty but the portions were ridiculously small. Wine was the best I've ever had in Berlin. The lamb was excellent too.
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,1,8/27/12,"Walked in at 8:30 tonight to an empty room, greeted by 2 cooks in the open kitchen. Waited for 2 minutes to be seated, noone showed up, so I sat down. After another 5 minutes the Maitre'D shows up and kicks me out fairly unpleasantly (apparently pissed that I dared to sit down), claiming they are fully booked. Understandable, but still not pleasant. Will update the rating if I get to decide to give it another try one day."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,8/15/13,"Such a surprise to find out that Bandol, even though it looks like a random French bouchon, actually is a gourmet restaurant offering extremely well executed dishes of french inspired cuisine in a molecular inspired expression with meats accompanied with condiments of foams, spheres and earth. Beetroot cream with tobacco gave the duck a delicious smoky touch, which was just one of many creative twists to roast duck sous vide. Won't go very much deeper into the subject, but the service was pleasant and informative, and the dishes were accompanied by a great selection of wines that all were thoughtfully paired with their dishes. Only objection I would have is that they don't work with card payment, so make sure to bring enough cash!"
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,4,3/4/09,"Unfortunately, this place has got very hip since Brad Pitt ate here. But it is still a very good French restaurant. Be warned - it's tiny, so you have to book!"
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,2,12/4/08,"This place is nothing to rave about. Everyone seems to be buying the Brad Pitt was there line. Folks, have you seen the Jackass episode with Brad Pitt in it? He is not someone who in my eyes determine what gourmet eating is. The place ispretty small and tried to be very New York. From the outside, with the plastic terrace (for the smokers) and the inside with the menu on the wall. There aren't many seats and the space is tight. The service couldn't seem to be bothered or at best are simply extremely inattentive. I had the entrecote and it was far from stellar with a lot of fat on it. It was edible but for the price and all the hype, not worth it. There are much better places in Berlin and this one doesn't deserve all the hype."
Bandol sur Mer,French,4,?21-40,5,5/17/10,Nice cozy stylish place in hyped up torstrasse... the foie dishes are unbelievable and the wine list is really well picked... open kitchen is always a plus... tres bien!!
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,4,9/23/17,Very cozy place to hang and eat. Food was good. Locations is near the Sony center. Definitely recommended!
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,4,12/27/16,"I came here for dinner and had a very nice meal. They have Bavarian style dishes here and I got one of my favorites, Schweinebraten. It was very well prepared and the prices was quite reasonable, around 10 EUR. I also got an excellent dark beer. Service was extremely fast. I got my meal very quickly, so if you're in a hurry this might be a good place. It's in an excellent location, in the vicinity of the Sony Center and Potsdamer Platz. It's also close to the Berlin Philharmonic symphony hall, where I was visiting later in the evening. It was a little busy and I almost couldn't get a table for one that evening. Service was about standard for a German restaurant."
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,1,8/28/17,"Extremely rude service. Its almost unbelievable how rude the server. I wanted to walk up and leave before finishing my dinner, but I was part of a larger group."
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,5,9/18/16,Excellent service with genuine German cuisine. I went to Augustiner Brau-Munchen and found Alt Bayern to be far superior service and the food to be of equal quality. Get the pair of course fried sausages.
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,5,4/7/17,We were having a hard time finding delicious German food while in Berlin. Then we came here and the stars aligned  I had two orders of the goulash soup because it was so delicious. Try the cheese stuffed Austrian sausage too :)
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,5,4/22/17,The place is very cozy and beautiful. Nice service. Their pork dish is great. It's not an expensive place. I would say 15? per person including a beer.
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,5,10/8/17,"They had very tasty food and good beer. I wish that they had a larger menu with some more classic dishes, but I enjoyed what I had. Would go again if in the area."
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,4,7/6/17,Great cozy place just off the crowded Postdamer Platz.  Good authentic Bavarian food and beer
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,4,5/2/17,"Great schnitzel , for the price and quality. Just the service is a little on and off that's why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars."
Gasthaus Alt Bayern,German,4,?11-20,3,6/11/17,Was ok but definitely not anything better. Pretzel was not warm and a bit hard. Schnitzel was ok but a bit flavorless.
Pan amb Oli,Spanish,4.5,?21-40,5,7/20/17,"Wonderful tapas, great location, great service, quiet neighborhood. My favorite tapas place in Berlin. It's got a cozy family-run vibe, and the outdoor seating is great. The rotating specials are also quite nice. Great for groups as well as romantic, quiet dinners for two."
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/28/17,"Got to Berlin with a hankering for some real German grub and we felt lucky to have wandered over to this place with the help of some yelp reviews ;-)Had a fantastic late lunch on a lovely odd summer day with rain drizzling but a perfect temperature to sit outside on the covered patio. So lovely to meet Ilene and hear her story of coming here 26 years ago from Dublin on a lark looking for adventure! Her knowledge of Berlin and German beers was awesome. If you are looking for yummy sausages good beer, great ambiance and a nice place to sit and take in the passer by look no further!We might just have to go back for seconds !"
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,4,11/7/17,And I was the one reluctant to eat German food - guess your broad impression is just sausages. BUT I love to be wrong and this place did it. Awesome Schniztel and more unpronouncable German dishes. The desserts were ten starts. Cozy atmosphere.
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,5,6/22/16,"Also known as Tucher Bratwurstha?sle because they sell Tucher Bra? beers. Their staff was very accommodating and gave a lot of nice suggestions. We had the Crispy Roasted Pork, Sausage Platter (highly recommended!!), Poultry Sausages and their Grilled Special of the day. Look for the English part of their menu! All dishes came with a side of potatoes (either in a salad or roasted-which I prefer) and sauerkraut (either fresh or abit cooked, don't know what it's called sorry! but we all liked the fresh one better). The place also had the game on and a great bar. Aside from the Tucher beers, they also had a variety of cocktails, wines etc. Overall a wonderful dining experience! Will come back if I could!"
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,2,4/16/17,"Good service, beer and ambiance, however the food was below average..... Rather disappointing. Dropping a review in order to warn others that might be duped by their high rating -- 4,5 (even tough it's not a deeply reviewed establishment). Service and beer was great, but the food was way off. This place does Bavarian food a great disservice."
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,5,2/10/17,"This is easily the best meal I had in Berlin. The service was incredibly warm and the place had a cozy but elegant feeling to it. The sausage platter came with sauerkraut and potato salad, and it was absolutely delicious. Portions were good and price is reasonable. Definitely a great choice for foreigners and locals alike!"
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/22/16,The Fr?nkischer Krustenbraten and the alcohol free Tucher Hefe Weizen were really good. The staff was friendly and I like the interior.
N?rnberger Wirtshaus,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/7/16,"Holy kaw, there is only one word I have: STUFFED!!!!Haven't had the meat sweats for quite some time, but this was something else!Very friendly staff, and the food was very good too. I was extremely satisfied and glad to have picked this place for dinner with my in-laws. I can only recommend the Obazn cheese (had it as a starter to share), the grill plate and the pork shoulder (Sch?ufle).Will definitely come back again!!!!"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,1/28/17,"I walked 10+ miles around Berlin as I am only here for one day.  At the end of my world wind tour, I was starving!!! I stopped in a Starbucks by the Brandenburg Gate to find a good place to eat.  I didn't want pub food, I wanted real food.  This place had good reviews so I decided to treat myself.Holy hell, this is easily one of the nicest restaurants I've ever been to and I've eaten at some very fancy establishments all over the world.  Every course was flavorful, the staff was friendly, best meal I've had in Europe hands down!!!!"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,7/9/16,"My boyfriend and I are fans of fine dining, so on our last Europe trip, we wanted to visit at least one fine dining place at every city we stopped by. Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer was the place for us on our stop in Berlin. The place has a great view of the brandenburg gate (if you want a view from the table, request it in advance). The restaurant is on the second floor of the Adlon hotel, and it has two dining room. We were seated on the inner dining room that's decorated like a library. I opted for a 6 course meal while my boyfriend got 7 courses. The bread was super memorable because it was served in a plate of hot rocks. My favorite dish of the meal was the lobster soup/bisque. It was super delicious. In terms of ""fine dining"", it was probably the more sophisticated meal we had on our trip (imo better than Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London, which was one of the more disappointing meal). Highly recommend it for anyone who loves fine cusine!"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,3/12/17,Celebrated my anniversary here. Had a 8-course dinner. The food was amazing. True art. Service incredibly friendly. Everything went smoothly. The dessert was my favorite. Absolutely recommended for couples especially. They will set the table romantically and make sure you have a great time.
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,4,12/29/16,"My friend and I went there for Christmas dinner. We got the table with the view of Brandenburg Gate. Very happy about this. The food was like arts, really GREAT, only the soup was too salty. Service was good. The security guard was very rude. Questioning us why we are at the lobby with very bad attitude. I was showing him the reservation confirmation but he does not even bother to look at it just asked us to follow him to go to the office, but he actually took us to another restaurant inside the hotel. He does not even say ""please"" when talking to us. The way he treated us was like we are the criminal. Very upset about this, ruin our holiday dinner."
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,12/7/16,"Very short and sweet: Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer exceeded our expectations. If you have anyone in your party who finds fine dining ""challenging,"" the 4-course menu will totally satisfy them. The restaurant is accommodating to dietary requirements, and the youthful staff is professional and a joy to watch."
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,4/30/16,"Excellent service from start to finish! Greeted us from the entry personally directed me with my name which I appreciate. I had the 7 course tasting menu with 2 bottles of Riesling 2010 recommended by the sommelier. It was so good we had to order a second bottle! We started with: Goose liver with coconut milk- it was my favorite dish! Goose liver was light and coconut milk definitely complimented the dish very well. Langoustine lobster and squid with extract of crustaceans, celery, caviar of vegetables bronze fennel was a simple soup with perfectly cooked lobster bites. Third dish we had eggplant with green gazpacho- this dish was ok but I didn't love it since I'm not a huge fan of eggplants. Next dish had sea urchin and oyster. It wasn't in their traditional appearance but it was condensed to small drops which wasn't my preferred choice but it was tasty as well. Fifth dish was pork belly with chili, cardamom, soy sauce, wild rice, and verbana. Pork belly was delicious!! Braised shoulder of lamb was my last dish- it was flavorful and very good!Our dessert included green bell pepper ice cream and caraibe chocolate. I was hesitant at first in my expectations of the green bell pepper ice cream but it was surprisingly refreshing and delicious! Also, they gave us 2 apps and 1 additional dessert complimentary. Loved the service and food. Will return!"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,5/13/15,"Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer Mesmerizes Dining at Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer in Berlin is the culinary journey of a lifetime. Even kings and queens would be humbled by the magnificent service and grandeur at this Two Star Michelin Rated restaurant. The sumptuous setting hosted fantastic cuisine with artistic presentations that would make Michelangelo proud. This meal will be one of the greatest gastronomical gifts you can bestow upon yourself.Chef Hendrick Otto's Quintessence II menu was enthralling. I elected the full eight courses along with the suggested wine pairings. With all the extra goodies they bring, it ends up being closer to 15 courses. Chef Otto is a sweet and incredibly talented maestro who exudes an affable & humble energy. Growing up his family grew fruits and vegetables, instilling a reverence for fresh ingredients and learning sensational old school recipes. His goal is to stimulate all of your senses and take you on riveting new flavor adventures, which he accomplishes in a grandiose fashion.While the entire experience was exceptional, it was the staff that placed the figurative bow on this gift. Their performance was a synchronized ballet full of smiles and laughter. They were exceptionally funny, warm and accommodating throughout the four-hour grand tasting.The evening commenced with an arrival of pre-course goodies: prawns drenched in chicken liver, a delightful peach and pear champagne libation, Parmesan breadsticks and so much more. Each dish was presented as if it belonged in the Louvre and made me swoon in bliss.The bread over rocks in the Garden of Eden was the most exquisite bread presentation I have ever ever witnessed. The crispy yet soft varieties were heightened with a truffle mayonnaise as well as a tomato and celery sauce.The Goose Liver / Frozen & Raw, a captivating foie gras ice cream, was an art piece in taste, appearance and execution. I was savoring every mind-blowing bite as dust from the cracker gleefully puffed from my mouth. The ginger, almond, raspberry, green peppercorn and orange peel gracing the top of the cracker swirled together in a symphonic fashion. The sweet German wine paired with this decadent dish was perfectly balanced and complemented the foie sensationally.The Pork Shoulder cooked table side on a diminutive backyard grill was quite tasty, but it was the Chef's mother's German potato side dish that was my favorite part, creating a beautiful interpretation of ""meat and potatoes.""The soft and salty bread with Camembert & Perigord truffle sauce blew my palate to smithereens. I still fantasize about this plate. The cheese and truffle combination in a warm cream contrasted against the spongy bread in a heavenly manner.Even the coffee presentation was rare and gorgeous.In preparation for dessert, they presented an uncommon palate cleanser beginning with foaming tangerine-scented dry ice. This was coupled with a dish comprised of tangerine, gin & tonic chunks and grapefruit sorbet. A truly innovative and sublime way cleanse the palate.Both the Coconut Mango (passion fruit, caramelized skin of milk, black tea, rose, basil) and Chocolate Air and Cream (blackberry, sea buckthorn, hip, oat flakes, buffalo milk, lavender) desserts were outstanding. The composition of the diverse ingredients added enchanting layers of flavor to every blissful spoon.While those two desserts were divine, it was the Carrot Cake with Dill Ice Cream & Rosemary Cotton Candy which blew my mind. The cake was immersed in a celestial apple and carrot sauce topped with phenomenal dill ice cream. The flavor composition was breathtaking. It was accompanied by rosemary cotton candy with a white chocolate bon bon at the base that was unique and exquisite. It was one of the most epic desserts I have ever devoured.There are a select group of special restaurants around the globe that are capable of delivering a mesmerizing dining experience that will be permanently etched into your memory and Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer is definitely among them.  This haven is located in the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, which is a feast for the eyes. The impeccable and entertaining service is fit for nobility. Add that to the aesthetically ravishing dishes that are packed with intense delectable flavors and you have one of the most paramount dining experiences of your entire existence.Pics at http://hedonistshedonist.com/blog/lorenz-adlon-esszimmer-mesmerizes/"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,4/10/16,Spectacular gourmet cooking in an old school dining room with views of the Brandenburg gate.
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,1/9/13,"I am dedicating my 1800th review to one of the best evenings of my life, dining at the fabulous Lorenz Adlon Eszimmer in BerlinThe Adlon Kempinski hotel is a grand old hotel with a prime location next to the Brandenberg Gate. Over the fireplace in the restaurant, there's a bust of the emperor dating from 1907 when the dining room openedIn a hotel with a bewildering number of restaurants, the Eszimmer is their 2 Michelin starred flagship where Chef Hendrik Otto creates dishes to live up to his motto of 'exciting, expressive, European-inspired cuisine'It's the sort of place I knew would be great from the moment I arrived. As I headed towards the restaurant for my 7pm booking, greeter Dagmar and maitre d' Boris H?bel waved me in, addressing me by name before I even had a chance to identify myself. I continued to be addressed by name by different members of staff throughout the evening and it's touches like these that make guests feel special and uniqueI think I was given the best table in the magnificent dining room, affording me a direct view of Brandenberg  Gate throughout my mealThe staff gave good guidance on the menu and drinks. On learning that I was teetotal, they concocted a lovely personalised non alcoholic cocktail based on what flavours I enjoy. Boris even substituted a dish on the tasting menu I had selected with one of his personal favourites - they then reprinted a personalised menu for me  with this substitution on it so I could follow the meal as it unfolded! Marc, the head waiter was phenomenal, making sure every guest felt they were the number 1 priority. We had numerous chats about food. He made sure the pacing of my meal was ok, casuing me to have a wise little break in the middle. As I was dining alone, I was even offered reading material, which caused a little pile of German food industry magazines to collect on my table. I was pleased to see that the atmosphere wasn't stuffy despite the ornate surroundingsMy 8 course tasting menu was augmented with multiple amuse bouches, pre-desserts and post-desserts. For some reason, they spoilt me with extra courses that I noticed other tables not receiving. Thanks, guys!These extra dishes were plated with the same attention to detail and intricacy that graced the main dishes. In fact, some of the my favourite things were in these extra dishes - an unctuous goose liver lollipop wrapped in chocolate dipped in nuts with popping candy, a truffle dipping sauce for the bread and the lightest cheesesticks1. Amuse plate5 elements including the aforementioned goose liver lollipop, crayfish parcel & tasting of cucumber2. Amuse 2Marinated halibut, carrot and exotic cream3. Goose liver, brioche cream, parfait, orange, coffee & polentaThe goose liver came in different guises but my favourite was in a sphere with truffle - an explosion of flavour as you burst it4. Freshwater crayfish, warm cocktail sauce, apricot gel, spinach, coconutIn the style of 2012 fine dining, a lot of dishes were finished at the table with Marc carefully pouring sauces in a lovely patterns. Nice re-interpretaion of prawn cocktail with little accents of hidden melon5. Mild smoked silver salmon, white bean fum?, jellied salt water, mangoWhat a wonderful umami hit from caviar and sea urchin sauce6. Scallop, pork belly, curry emulsion, banana, fennel, artichoke, passion fruitReads like the creation of a madman, eats like the creation of a genius. A lot of dishes came with a bonus side dish - fennel salad in this case7. Pigeon, olive sauce, onion rings, pistou, garlicPerfectly cooked pigeon breast with cute mini rings8. Nebraska beef, goulash sauce shallots, beetroot, almondA bonus of crispy cake on the side9. Twitched goat cheese, jellied gazpachoThese came with a tomato basil and sponge cake, crispy sweet onion slivers & powerful mint leaves to bring it together10. Pre-dessertExcellent palate cleanser of lemon sorbet, carrot sponge, orange foam, blackberries11. Chocolate, buttermilk pumpkin ice creamChocolate came as ganache and bubbled cake. There were fennel stones, sea buckthorn, milk mousse & rosehip in another successful mixing of unlikely partners12. Petit foursCandy floss. Apple ring beignet, 'Coffee to eat' (deconstructed tiramisu), buttermilk ice cream, homemade Snickers, raspberry macaroonFinally, Alexander offered me a choice of pralines from a giant box - the flashing full sign on my stomach & decorum allowed me to choose only spiced pear & passion fruitMarc talks about delivering the package to guests and it really was the complete package tonight. If you're in Berlin and you have the means to pay for it, do come and spend an evening here. You won't be disappointed"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,9/10/15,Lorenz is likely the best that Germany has to offer. An experienced sommelier who is second to no one and a Maitre D' with unparalleled excellence. But it's about the food. And Lorenz is a great evening for the most discerning diners. The perfect balance of service and friendliness. Will never go to Berlin without dinner in Germany's finest hotel . And I'll always stop to pay hommage to Franz in the Lobby Lounge.
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,8/30/15,"Can I please give Lorenz Adlon 10 stars? This dinner made it to the list of LIFETIME top 3 meals. I know I am being dramatic, but I am speaking from the heart. We walked into the lovely dining room of the historic Adlon Hotel and soaked in the grand decor. The hostess greeted us with a genuine, friendly smile and sat us at a table with an unobstructed view of Bradenburg Gate. It was so fun to watch the people congregating in the square as the sun set behind the gate. My husband and I ordered the 6-course fixed price menu, which actually ends up being more like 9 courses if you count the palate cleansers. My husband had the wine pairing and felt that the wines were exquisitely matched with each dish. Each course we had was true art, the temperatures were always perfect, and the presentation was spot on and perfectly coordinated. The service was professional and friendly- not pretentious at all. They made us feel welcome, really like family. By the time the experience was over, my husband and I were very full.  If we ever visit Berlin again and we have the means, we'll be back (and we won't have lunch that day in preparation)."
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,4/18/12,"Fancy! The restaurant is located on the second floor of the hotel and overlooks the Brandenburg gate. If you have an option, you should request your table to be close to the window so you can enjoy the view. From beginning to end, this place makes you feel like you are their number one priority. Upon arrival before we said anything, they greeted us by NAME! How cool is that. I have only been to one other restaurant ever that has greeted me and known who I was before I uttered a word. At the end of our meal, they walked us out and shook our hands thanking us for dining with them.We ordered from the a la carte menu and everything we tried was wonderful. They supplied many a amuse bouche as well. I really liked this place because you felt relaxed and comfortable because the staff was attentive, charming, and made you laugh. The restaurant is small, intimate, and does not feel pretentious. One of the highlights for me was the chocolate foie gras lollipop. Heaven on a stick I tell you!"
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,4/14/16,Most amazing experience in a very long time a perfect mixture of food and art with exceptional service! Perfection at every turn!
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,1/21/13,"This restaurant holds for me one of the most esteemed places in my mind, as it was part of one of the most memorable celebrations of my life. This was a year ago, and it was the most beautiful new year's eve dinner I have experienced. From beginning to end, the service was superb, the atmosphere was elegant but not stiff, the food was simply outstanding, and the wine pairing was perfect.When the clock struck twelve, seeing fireworks over the Brandenburg Gate from the restaurant's balcony surrounded by family and strangers who became friends is something I will not forget. It was truly a great memory."
Lorenz Adlon Esszimmer,Modern European,5,Above ?41,5,12/7/12,Superb! Visiting this restaurant was one of my best experiences. The staff makes you feel special and the food was excellent.
La Cantine D?Augusta,French,4.5,?11-20,5,8/23/15,"There are places in Berlin you keep coming back and you know why. Coz they're damn good. This is one of these places. The food, the atmosphere, the drinks at very decent prices (I mean, you can get a bottle of champagne for less than ?40!), the super nice service. Ok it can be slow at times, but you're there to enjoy true quality time."
La Cantine D?Augusta,French,4.5,?11-20,3,8/14/15,"Ok, I am french, and I find it ridiculous to pay 10? for a camembert that I would find for 3/4? back home. The quality is a good quality cheese, and good quality charcuterie (dried meats ) . You also have good wine. But the prices are just too much for me.The place is nice, and the guys working there are nice too. I'm just always sceptic about places that make you pay so much more because it's french. I was homesick once, went there, got a cheese box, and payed more than a return ticket to paris with Air France (cca 50? 1 way ) or easyjet ( cca 80/100? ) both ways... Bottom line : If you don't care about money go there. It's good food, and it's prepared with care and passion, that's for sure."
La Cantine D?Augusta,French,4.5,?11-20,5,9/4/14,I found La Augusta through a recommendation of a French local in Berlin. A taste of France...amazing French wine and cheese selection. Located in a beautiful street in Sch?neberg - perfect place for lunch - nice brie sandwich and a glass of ros?.
La Cantine D?Augusta,French,4.5,?11-20,5,10/4/14,"Probably the best place in town for wine, ham, cheese and other french goodies in Berlin! Try the tartines!"
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,5,7/4/13,"Great restaurant in Kreuzberg area.Steak, mussels and fish soup all great.  The desserts are nice as well."
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,1,4/17/17,"I seriously don't get why this place got such good reviews. The plates were so smallWe could not see the fish and stake we ordered. And the prices were ridiculously high. Avoid. So many better options around."
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,4,11/11/16,"A lovely little French-inspired restaurant. The food is yummy for a very fair price. The vegetarian quiche costs less than 4? by itself, or 5.50? with a salad to the side. Service is friendly and efficient. The only reason I leave one star off is that the ambiance is not amazing. It can feel a little bit cramped, but is altogether a really nice local place."
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,4,2/8/13,"This was one of my favorite go-to restaurants while studying in Berlin!My friends and I always walked by this place on our search for food, and were always tempted to try. There were always a lot of people sitting outside and eating (when the weather was still pleasant). So one day we finally tried it, and we were hooked. The steak and the salmon, nommm. I wish we tried the mussels, because we saw them a few times, but then we never saw them on the menu? or something. Some awkward times though, hearing them speak french, wanting to speak french, but then using half german half english."
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,5,9/2/14,"A jewel of hearthy real grandma's (that french grandma) cooking. Wholesome dishes that require cooking skills. So no salads or soups that anybody with some sense of appetite could create. I love that their daily menu changes each day with 5-6 dishes. Not a 5 eur lunch place though. Rather 7-8 per person. In Paris they would be a jewel"
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,4,3/24/11,"C'est charmant, dudes!! A simple, relaxing, authentic location. The moment you come in you feel that men rule this place. No look is the look, which is not bad at all. You stop at the counter behind which the food is being cooked, choose among the two or three dishes of the day (changes one-two times a week), a couple of Tarte Flambee (very tasty but not especially large) and several constant dishes (lots of meat meat). Then you walk to the table collecting on your way a knife and a fork from an old buffet and wait till the food is served. You can also order a glass of table wine to accompany your meal.What I especially like about this place is that the drinks they sell are all bottled in glass. Since I am a big enemy of plastic bottles I consider this as a special bonus. All in one: tasty, relaxing, pretty fast (though you still have to wait for the food a bit), good for visiting with friends or on your own and pretty inexpensive. Bon app?tit!"
Chez Michel,French,4,?11-20,4,4/26/11,Nice. Just got introduced to this place. No bells and whistles. Good (fresh) food and friendly service. I'll be back. :-)
L?eustache,French,4.5,?11-20,5,10/7/16,"Another hipster hidden gem, great simple industrial deco, simple menu yet delicious - lamb was fabulous.Nice service, totally recommend."
L?eustache,French,4.5,?11-20,5,4/2/16,"Nice cosy place in the heart of Schiller kiez in Neukolln. The lamb last saturday was amazing! Always a friendly service. I also recommend the chocolat fondant. Thank you Justine, I will be back again soon."
L?eustache,French,4.5,?11-20,5,11/8/15,"Very delicious French cuisine. Not too expensive and good wines. Also, very nice ambiance. Only wish they were open more hours."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2/25/16,"Wow real great pizza, reminds me of the ones i had in Napoli.. actually all the courses were delicious, at out table we tried melanzane alla parmigiana and lasagna too.. just incredible. Only downside for me is the location, 8 minutes walk from the first train station (bus stop is close though)"
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,4,1/4/18,"Really tasty italian food! The appetizers were great- recommend the beef carpaccio and eggplant parmigiana. Pizza was better than most, though not the best in Berlin. Standard selection and lots of creative pies. Solid crust. Altogether good meal."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,3,7/19/17,"The pizzas were delicious but the service was a little off. We got there at 5:30, when they open. They were there but not ready for us. Fair enough. But they didn't come to the door to even let us in, or acknowledge we were there. A cool reception. The tables on the street are noisy and unpleasant. I recommend sitting inside or in the garden (which they didn't offer us). All in all, the service experience feels like the amateurish Berlin of 10 years ago, not the standards of the international dining city that it's become today."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,3/9/17,"My wife and I lived in Italy for several years, and visited Naples a few times, so we feel qualified to say that the pizzas are Prometeo are on par with a quality pizzeria in Naples. They even have an imported wood burning pizza oven from Naples, which is prominently visible when you walk in. The prices are also very reasonable, and the service was friendly and efficient. We also enjoyed the suppli' (rice balls) and tiramis?. We are regular customers and we highly suggest a visit, you will not be disappointed."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,3/29/17,"HANDS DOWN. I've tasted a lot of pizzas in Berlin, but this one is the absolute best. It tastes like it was made in Italy. You actually taste the authenticity of this pizza. Incredible."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,4,10/30/16,"Only had take out (thus far) so I can't comment on the service, but the pizza is pretty well-executed napoletano style pizza with tasty dough and fair prices. Will be trying out the storefront soon!"
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,6/6/17,"Simple yet with great incredients, thin, perfect crust, savory - the last time I had such a good Pizza was literally two decades ago in Bologna."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,8/3/16,"This place is wonderful! I took my family here to celebrate my sister's work achievements. Our dinner for four, was - all appetizers from the menu- all seafood small bites from the menu- one small meat platter- bottle of wine - couple manhattansTotal cost was 202 Euro, + 30 Euro tipI loved everything! Felt like they were understaffed."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,2,1/14/18,"I came here for the two-course lunch special (?11.50) and was very disappointed with the food, especially after reading all the stellar reviews.For my starter, I ordered the carpaccio, which was pretty decent, but not good enough for me to come back and order it again.For my entr?e, I was debating between the burger and the sea bass, but I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering the burger. I saw three other locals in the restaurant order this as well, so I thought it must be delicious. Boy was I wrong! The burger had a weird curry flavor and there was nothing in it but a few lettuce scraps glued on with some white sauce.I was really excited to try this place but in the end, I was let down."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,11/25/16,"This is a fairly new joint in the heart of Berlin's exciting Mitte borough. Most tourists may discover it while strolling around nearby Rosenthaler Platz and also Hackesche H?fe. Torstrasse still breathes the morbid charme and architecture of cold war Berlin, but trendy businesses, restaurants and bars are claiming this area reminiscent of NYC's village or Beijing's Nanluogu Xiang hutong."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,5/23/17,"Ambiance AMAZING!!!! We had dinner on the patio and the weather was perfect! Food made to order, very fresh. Cauliflower was delicious along with the sweet potato fries. The chicken and beef topped the list also in the meat category. Our waitress was extremely nice. Will definitely dine here again when friends are in town!"
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,4/18/16,"Divine modern dinner! Authentic and very wholesome, most value for price. Staff here are lovely, and make the best recommendations. Enjoyed the chic sleek modern ambience, perfect for a date out or chill out :))"
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/8/16,"This restaurant was a great surprise. It is part of a hotel and seemed at the first look more hip than focused on the food, but in the end we had a great meal. They offer Mediterranean food, but in contrast to what most of the people would expect for Mediterranean it has some strong influences from the middle east. We ordered the mixed grill with 2 side dishes. The portions are generous and the quality of the meat was great. Everything was cooked to perfection and with the added Middle Eastern spices it felt a bit exotic. The side dishes were also great. We had some pumpkin and grilled chicory both dishes excellent. In addition to the food we had 2 different glasses of wine from the open bottles they offer and both were excellent and very reasonable priced. Given the quality of the food and drinks the prices are very reasonable. Also the service was very good. I will certainly go back there."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/24/13,"Very tasty.I ordered the green salad as a starter, it had nice fresh leaves and a simple dressing. My dining companion got the mezze and the eggplant was scrumptious.For entrees, I ordered the lamb ribs and she ordered the lamb kebab.The lamb ribs were very tender and flavorful and paired nicely with the figs. The lam kebab was a bit fatty but still good.We finished with peppermint tea, which came with a tiny cube of amazing halvah.The portions were the perfect size. I gave it a 4 because while delicious, it didn't have the mindblowingness that a 5 does."
Restaurant Mani,Mediterranean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/12/13,"Been here twice  once for lunch, once for dinner.I enjoyed the food, the wine selection and the interior. Service was great, the waiters know what they are doing. The food has been great both times  even though I just got the kebab the second time, it's been the best kebab I've had in Berlin in a long, long time or maybe ever.The lunch menu is an insane deal. I couldn't believe it at first and wouldn't be surprised if they get rid off it soon.If you're looking for something clearly above the average, you should check this place."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/28/17,"As I told my companion, when I die, I would like Zur Kleinen Markthalle to be where I end up. Traveling in Europe as an American can be intimidating, but the second we walked in, we felt as though this place had been made for us. Our bartender and waiter not only spoke English--they were witty and friendly, which made us feel immediately at home. The wine and beer selection was succinct and lovely. Our buttered pretzel, bratwurst, and waffle desserts were a delight. It was hard to leave this place--so hard that it was a struggle to head back into the cold January night. Zur Kleinen Markthalle has been around since 1888, and now I know why."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,9/14/17,"Excellent pork knuckle, sausage and beer. The staffs are friendly and the restaurant atmosphere is very laid back. Unfortunately,  it is CASH only ~ so make sure you have it, otherwise, you'll wash the dishes....(coming from the waiter )"
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,7/10/17,"After the place we thought we'd go for dinner turned out to be closed, we made our way here for what turned out to be an excellent meal. The weather was just dry enough to allow us to sit outside under an umbrella and enjoy the comfortable temperature (albeit with the addition of second-hand smoke from other diners, a fact of life in Europe). We ordered two excellent beers and both of us enjoyed the pork knuckle (Schweinhaxe), which was crispy as anything outside and succulent inside. The portion size though was enormous and neither of us could finish--it would be better to have shared one."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,5,7/18/17,Amazing place to have great food and a beer on a summer night in Berlin. Great atmosphere in the outdoor seating area in the front that takes you away from the hustle and bustle of nearby streets. The pig knuckle and crispy chicken are divine. Very friendly wait staff. Be aware that they only accept cash. Highly recommended.
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,7/2/15,"A new take on fried chicken.It's probably already been done, but this fried chicken was a totally new story. Everything is made to order but the 30 minute wait is well worth it. The chicken is only lightly breaded so it's very thin and crispy when it comes out. The entire half chicken is fried, so you're going to need to dissect it like a rotisserie chicken. The inside is surprisingly moist, especially when you realize it's harder to control the temperature when deep frying. The chicken was the first item to go on our table.The pork butt was very similar to the chicken, although the breading was a little thicker on this one. I can only take so much pork flavor, so I opted to finish the chicken first. The currywurst wasn't too special, although their sauerkraut was one of the first I've ever had that I've actually enjoyed. Sour without tasting spoiled, the cabbage was also cooked thoroughly which made it easier to eat.For dessert we tried the red jelly, which was really just a berry compote topped with whipped cream. I thought it was the perfect ending to the heavy meal because the sourness of the compote cut through all the grease. Service was spotty because we were seated outside and it was tough to get anyone's attention. Maybe it was our inner impatient New Yorker coming out though. Pop by for a hearty, meat heavy meal."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,3,7/25/15,"It took around half an hour to wait for our pork leg. The pork is soft, the skin is so crispy but a bit hard to bite. The atmosphere here is classic and nice!"
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,12/5/15,Went with a couple of local friends.  Since it was a Saturday night we had reservations and were seated immediately.  Good beer and decent wine list. The 1/2 chicken was divine as were the sides of kraut and potato salad.  I'd come back.
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/1/15,"Consistently good and reasonably priced German food and beer.  Their 1/2 chicken is divine: it's neither deep fried or roasted, or is it? But it's always moist and crunchy and worth the wait! The potato salads with either a yoghurt or oil and vinegar dressing are staples which you won't want to miss.  Ditto the fresh cabbage salad.  After tasting the curry wurst here I'll never go back to another street stand! Plenty of beers to chose from, This is ideal for groups.  Have a Feige Sau for dessert...."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,4/12/11,"While I usually ended up there when Die Henne (http://www.yelp.com/biz/henne-berlin#hrid:9Z_eeUgu4rW3nRI9eS82VA) was too full (or closed, which happened a lot, too) and my urge to eat a baked chicken became to strong, this is a very decent alternative to Die Henne. The chickens are almost as good and there's usually space. A very nice place for a summer afternoon/evening dinner."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,6/8/12,"Die Henne's phone was off the hook. Showed up there and wouldn't budge on areservation. Fortunately walked to Zur kleinen Markthalle. Friendly traditonalGerman atmosphere. Shared table with German group. Excellent roasted chicken, ordered kraut salad which was great. Good Berlin pils on tap. Hadtheir special dessert drink, very enjoyable and would go back next time inBerlin."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,3/22/12,"Walked in tonight and was warmly welcomed, great atmosphere, captures a classic beer hall to a T!  Food was delicious, if authentic deutschen pub food is what you are seeking, this place will satisfy!"
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,4/27/09,"The place has a nice atmosphere, in as well as outside. The service is quick and the food is really good. The fried chicken was really a delight, crunchy, not fat, but not dry either. Definitely a place I'll return to."
Zur kleinen Markthalle,German,4.5,?11-20,4,6/18/08,"4 stars for now as I haven't personally tried it yet but I've heard from a few people that it's the 'best' fried chicken in Berlin. Haven't really encountered too many fried chicken places so come very optimistic. Amongst other side stuff, they have 1-Fried Chicken & 2-Schwein-Axe (a big leg? of pig wonderfully falling off the bone - Henry the 8th style). I first had this Pig-Axe in Dusseldorf & it was the 3rd best thing I've had in Germany. 1st being 'Mustafas Gem?se Kebab' Doner place on Mehringdam & 2nd the cheesy spaetzle at Yorkschlassen. Oh & also Beer & a garden."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,1/4/18,I have only been here during the day and tried charcuterie with my coworkers. It was my first time having charcuterie in a restaurant and personally I enjoyed it. I would love to come here during the night and try out more dishes and maybe some drinks as well.
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,1,10/21/17,"Food was alright. The waitress gave us shots for free... and we found them on our check. Oh and they didn't split bills larger than 100?. So if you're into ""alright"" food with bad customer service. This is the place!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,10/27/17,"My wife and I came across this place on our way back from Mikkeler bar. This place was best accidental find we have come access in a long time! It looked popular, and turned out to be for good reason. We ordered the veggie Spanish omelette tapas, the veggie cheese tapas, and steak with fries for the main dish. All were incredibly delicious. My experience with Spanish Tapas in the US means I should probably order a few plates because they are small... not so here! The plates turned out to be much larger then the pictures we saw. The complimentary bread was sooo good, we ordered some cheese to go with it, the same cheese the table next to us had ordered, it turned out to be the perfect pairing. This place has a lot of character, the attention to detail was amazing, the service was as quick as could be expected with how busy they were."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,3,10/3/17,"Never expect too much of a tapas places if you're not Spain but actually this was quite surprising. Probably we were lucky with our order - tortilla, croquetas, pollo con ciruelas - pretty solid. Beer way too expensive, though. Nice 'taberna' environment."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,7/7/17,"Yosoy Tapas bar is a really authentic Spanish restaurant. Due to the fact that I had been to Spain multiple times in the past, I have had high expectations. They were definitely exceeded. All meals were prepared in the true Spanish way and were not only authentic, but absolutely delicious. A definite MUST for all Spanish cuisine lovers in Berlin!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,3,7/5/16,I came with friends at around 4:30 pm and it was pretty empty and plane. I really like the way the benches and seats are set up. You are right there on the street and can do all the people watching up close - face-to-face.  Good choice of wines as well warm and cold tapas.
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,3,2/23/16,"The place has very much replicated the look and liveliness of a Spanish tapas bar. The food and drink are good, but not memorable. The service is good. I had Padron peppers that were perfectly fried. The mushrooms were rubbery and needlessly surrounded by sauce and veggie bits. In Spain, they just grill them with olive oil. Most disappointing was the Spanish Tortilla,which was a bit rubbery and made without onions. I missed the onions. When in Berlin, this isn't worth a visit."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,1/18/17,Very nice place just in the corner of Hackescher Markt! The place is very crowded and the Spanish music makes it very attractive! Big selection of wines in very good prices and the service is very friendly! There is not so much space in general it's very cosy. Next time we will try the food too :)
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,9/21/16,Great selection of food and good portion size as well. They even had a separate gluten free menu! And entire menu had an English translation. The plums w/bacon were delicious!
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,12/26/15,"Excellent wine option and lots of tapas plates. I was a happy man"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,8/16/16,"Amazing & I am celiac ... Do t miss out!! Great vibe and amazing gf bread!!! Waitress was great' so fun.,, but chaotic with seating but once in seat amazing!!! Celiac??? Go here!!!! Great price too!!!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,1,9/9/16,"Does not taste or feel like a authentic tapas restaurant. When we arrived we were served a basket of dry bread. We didnt get any olive oil or other garments to go with it so basically didnt touch it after tasting it. The waitress spent 20 minutes in the bar without any guests before paying us attention. The menu was a dissapointment in variety, and lacked many of the classical tapas dishes. The dishes arrived with 5-10 minutes in difference over a time period of 30 minutes and they kept us there for way to long time. When we wanted to leave and pay, it took almost 15 minutes to get the bill in an totally empty restaurant. Very poor service, a culinary dissapointment, and definitely NOT the tapas restaurant you want to go to in Berlin."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,2,6/30/15,"Can be good depending on how hungry you are, however definitely not Spanish.They sell ""gambas al ajillo"" as a cold dish. This plate is actually cooked in the oven and served very hot.""Mojo rojo"" is made out of red pepper amongst others, however what they give you is a ""tomato based sauce"". Don't be fooled by the Spanish waiters. The food is not Spanish."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,8/14/15,"While YOSOY has great food, ambience and location, what I found most outstanding was the service. My four friends and I were assisted by four different staff members, and each of them worked hard to ensure we got the food we'd like best. Ask away if you have any questions or you want to try something before ordering it, these guys are really helpful. There are plenty of great vegetarian options- the spinach/avocado/cucumber soup can be made vegetarian upon request, and it's refreshing, filling and delicious. I also loved the Spanish Mixed Vegetables dish, the aubergine and cheese in it had been roasted to perfection. It can get slightly pricey, but I think it's worth a visit."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,5,10/14/15,"Delicious tapas, really cosy place and the staff is amazing. We arrived for a late dinner at around 9 pm. the place was packed, but in a good way - there was a really good and cosy atmosphere in there. A waiter came up to us immediately and said a table would be free in 5 min. The staff was really nice in terms of helping us choose what to order and how much. From the cold tapas we ordered shrimps in garlic oil and chorizo. From the warm we had the spinach pie with blue cheese sauce, fried calamari, potatas bravas and two orders of dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside (each order consisted of 3 dates, and we really liked them, so we wanted a lot. All the food was amazing as well as the cocktails (we had a pina colada and a frozen mango daiquiri).I think we ended up paying 55? for everything excluding the tip."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,2,4/11/16,"The all-you-can-eat Tapas concept was cool, but that's it. Food wasn't good. Too many fried Tapas and almost every dish had Pepper inside."
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,1/17/15,"All you can eat tapas for less than 10? + delicious sangria, what more could you want?!This is one of my go-to places to bring guests visiting from out of town since it is near many tourist spots and has something for everyone to eat (lots of vegetarian and gluten-free options). The restaurant decor definitely has some spanish flair. The outdoor seating is a good people-watching spot given the restaurant's location in a pretty high-traffic area. One star off because some of their tapas options are not that delicious sometimes, but I have been more pleased than displeased. Also, the regular prices for the tapas seem kind of marked up, so just come during the all-you-can-eat hours and you're golden!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,1/2/16,"Great selection of Tapas - there is something for everyone. I've been there three or four times now, and I always enjoyed it. The staff is very attentive, and the food tastes really great. It is such a shame that you get full after some of the tapas - I would love to order just all of them! Anyway, with their selection of hot and cold, vegetarian and gluten-free Tapas, nearly everyone will be able to find something he or she will like. And although the place tends to be crowed in the evening, you generally have to wait just some minutes until a table is ready - often, one of the waiters will just walk up to you and inform you about the approximate waiting time.I would definitely recommend the YOSOY to anyone looking for a great Mediterranean meal!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,4,10/25/14,"I've been there several times and never disappointed - it is crowded (good sign, isn't it) and small, but the atmosphere is nice and Mediterranean, the waiters busy but helpful, and  all the tapas I've ever  ordered there were fresh and tasty. I read below some very bad reviews, naming Yosoy the worst Spanish restaurant in Berlin... well, I guess it is not just. I live next to 4 posh Spanish restaurants and I can definitely say that Marysol at Savigny Platz has far worse tapas and arrogant service, and even the spectacular terrace and the prettty interior arrangement don't help. Go and try yourself - I can honestly recommend Yosoy!"
YOSOY,Spanish,3.5,?11-20,1,10/11/15,"Not a fine dining experience.Appetizer plate was mostly deep fried and tastelessPaella with seafood had no flavour. Did someone forget herbs and spicesWine of the week came from last month's barrel.Sorry - 0.5/10"
Caramel,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/6/12,"I have actually tried this establishment once, back when I was still a new arrival here in Berlin. Anyway, today, I didn't bring lunch with me, so I had to get some. I strolled a block away to this cafe. And based on how they are run, I think they deserve 5 stars.This is a place where you can sit down and eat. They have 3 different set menus every day, which includes a soup, a main course, and a dessert, all hovering around 5,90 EUR. They also have sandwiches. They also have pasta salads (you get a huge quantity for just 3,50 EUR). They also have a deal where you can get a 0,2 liter cold drink for just 1 EUR with your set menu. Oh, you can also order just the main dish within the menu for 4,00 EUR, and you can even order that for take-away.Isn't that nice? There's so many options. You want a power lunch? You want to have a meeting over lunch? You want a quick coffee? This is a family-run establishment (it seems so, because a few weeks ago, they had a notice saying they all would be on vacation for a week), and it seems to be running quite well.Oh, I forgot to say something about my food. I ordered the Menu 2 for that day, to take-away. It was the pasta with fresh spinach in gorgonzola sauce. Yeah, they know how to do it al dente. I'll definitely be back."
Caramel,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/13/11,"The set menues are highly recommendable. During the summer time one can sit ourside and the owner and the staff are very friendly. I still come here regularly in my lunch break after approximately 30 visits :)Die Men?s sind sehr zu empfehlen! Im Sommer kann man auch gut drau?en sitzen und der Inhaber und die Bedienung sind sehr nett. Nach gesch?tzen 30 Besuchen gehe ich weiterhin gerne in meiner Mittagspause dorthin :)"
Baba Angora,Turkish,4,?11-20,4,2/6/15,Fun place with good food. Must try are the flat bread and an assortment of yogurt dips. It is wonderful and fun.  The wine selection is small but it was good. I ordered the award winning Kayra Okuzgozu 2012. If you like your red dry then this is the wine for you. We finish the night with a shot of Turkish grape spirit with aniseed. It's smooth and yummy. Must appreciate licorice to like this.
Baba Angora,Turkish,4,?11-20,2,3/30/16,"We ordered the shared starter of dips and bread and it was pretty tasteless,I had the spicy lamb dish for mains and again I thought this was very tasteless.The service was good and other diners seemed to be enjoying their food so maybe we just ordered the wrong thing for us."
Baba Angora,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,10/13/13,"Every dish we ordered was amazing I recommend specially the yogurt tavuk and their dessert kufana was beyond spectacular , tip try it with their ""Chai"" black tea"
Baba Angora,Turkish,4,?11-20,5,1/31/16,"This was our first visit to a Turkish restaurant in Berlin and we loved it.  We started out with some cold vorspeise - humus and a selection of different vegetable dishes.  All were excellent.  Our group had a variety of main dishes - lamb, minced meat, spicy chicken, and everybody was stuffed (large plates!) and happy at the end.  Very friendly waiters - they helped everyone with our coats, and joked with us several times."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,1/16/15,"If you're dating a foodie, you eventually turn into a foodie. Or so it seems.Anyway, we were here earlier tonight for a dinner date, as it's been a while since we went to a nice restaurant. We made a reservation for two, and at 18:00 when they opened, we showed up, and a table was waiting for us. While they had a small menu, there were quite a bit of selections with regards the appetizers, and a few more for the main courses. However, we both thought that the appetizers were more interesting than the main courses, so instead of ordering an appetizer and a main course, we each ordered three appetizers, as a three-course meal, in addition to a well-recommended bottle of red wine.I began with the Sicilian aubergine salad, which is served cold, which is paired with fried pecorino cheese, which is warm. The combination is just heavenly. I followed that with the Burrata. Oh, that was something else. I haven't tasted such a juicy piece of cheese before. And the pairing with the tomatoes and fried basil, while simple, definitely works, and is surely a work of art.Finally, I had the rabbit liver, in balsamic vinegar. That was quite rich, and a nice finish to our meal. My companion ordered the fish carpaccio, followed by the scallops, as well as the rabbit liver. They looked tasty, though I didn't taste them. The reactions they produced, however, seemed to say that they indeed were tasty.The staff was quite attentive, with good wine recommendations, and definitely knows how to manage a restaurant to make their customers happy.So, overall, a good experience. If there was one thing I would want to change, is the music. ABBA-inspired elevator music isn't really the best music one would like to hear while having a relaxed and intimate evening with one's loved ones. But that won't prevent me from paying them another visit one of these days."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,7/4/16,"Gr?nfisch was our only find in Google that promised to have monk fish on the menu, so we decided to go there for a little team event. When my colleague called the place we learned that the menu changes weekly, based on what fish they manage to get fresh. Unfortunately monk fish was not available when we were there but we all got very delicious dishes. Seems like we'll ""have to"" go back for the monk fish an other week..."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,5/30/16,"This little Sicilian restaurant was brilliant! Really tasty authentic food, great menus that you could mix and match, varied selection. Everything was very fresh, beautifully prepared, and such a great combination of flavours. The wine selection was terrific, lots of good Sicilian wines. But our favorite part was the service, everyone were so nice and attentive, taking great care of us!"
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,10/2/14,"This little Sicilian place is one of the biggest positive foodie surprises I experienced in the last half year. I rarely leave a restaurant so excited. It's a bit pricy for Berlin but definitely worth a try.The service was attentive, charming and helpful especially with the wine selections. We went for the Gew?rztraminer and really enjoyed it. The menu is small but diverse. The offer several predefined 3-course-menues where each course is also orderable separately. Starters are around 12?, main dishes 17? and desserts 5?. I think with wine and water we paid around 50? per person.The only downside is that the restaurant is quite small, so your chances of successfully securing a table without reservation is slim and it's quite noisy and hot when full."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,4,6/8/14,"Service was helpful & friendly. Burrata was delicious. Black spaghetti dish was amazing. A little bit pricey for Berlin, but not terrible. Great date-night destination"
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,4,11/1/13,"Fantastic Italian food. Great service and they have their own house wine :) Tiny bit pricey so probably best kept for special occasions. We went with a party of 6 and had starters, mains and maybe 4 bottles of wine for 40euros/head."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,4,8/27/11,"War im Rahmen eines Business-Diners ins Gr?nfisch eingeladen.Der Service war aufmerksam und schnell und hat auf die Bed?rfnisse R?cksicht genommen.Ich selber hatte ein Drei-Gang-Men?. Das Essen war sehr lecker und entsprechend auf den Punkt gegart.Leider w?re es sch?ner gewesen, wenn vor dem Essen der Gast dar?ber informiert worden w?re, dass das Kartenleseger?t defekt ist.Das Restaurant ist zu empfehlen. Vielleicht aber vorher mal nachfragen, ob die Technik funktioniert."
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,3,12/16/10,Na ja. Die generelle Beurteilung ist ?bertrieben. Jedenfalls kann das nur mit 3 Sternen relativiert werden. Aber das trotz optimalem Wohlf?hlfaktor. Es mu? sein.
Gr?nfisch,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,11/23/10,"Gruenfisch has good reports wherever you find something written about the Restaurant. I went there on October 22 and I only can confirm all the good things that have been said about this Restaurant.My delightment started with the initial offering of fresh made bread with a spread from basil and dried tomatos and a wonderful sicilian olive oil.Our starters were Fegato dOca (10 EUR) and Cappesante Gratinate (12 EUR). The raw apple was just wonderful with the goose liver. Cappesante Gratinate often are dry because of being too long in the oven. These were not and they were served in their shells with a Ratatoulle of peppers, zucchini and eggplant.As main dishes we had Ravioloni stuffed with St Peters Fish (13EUR) and boar filet (21 EUR). The ravioloni were served in a pumkin cream with two big scampi, which were wonder ful fresh and gave a strong flavor to the dish. I love boar and getting a perfectly cooked boar filet is an experience  it needs to be somewhat more cooked than beef filet, but i mustnt be well done, it has to be rosa inside. This was just as I love it. The potato cake, which came with the boar was a bit too salty, but..We had a glass of Inzolia and 0.5 l of the Castello Rosso, a biological wine from the Milazzo vinery, which is linked to the owners, both slightly too expensive  but thats Germany.Grappa and Coffee was offered by the Restaurant, an incredible nice touch of ospitality. Overall bill 80EUR,  we would wish to find a Restaurant like this in Rome."
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,5,12/6/17,"I came with a group of 7. It's a quaint place that serves very good French food. We ordered a bunch of dishes from steak, frites, meatballs, mussels, and even had room for dessert. The menu is only in French and German, so we had to google translate it, but if you know the basic language, you should be fine. The wait staff was a little stiff at first, but as the food started coming, one of the guys started loosening up and was very nice. I recommend coming here if you want to good food!"
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,4,10/13/16,"I went to Garcon for a light dinner, and I was very impressed.  The restaurant was really cute, and though it's rather large, it still felt cozy the way it was divided into two rooms.  I wasn't very hungry, though the menu looked fantastic.  I just had a glass of red wine and a bowl of their vegetable soup with bread, and everything was excellent.Service was great, certainly the best I encountered during my long weekend in Berlin.  As an added bonus, the restaurant has really good, late hours.  I would love to go back and try their breakfast the next time I'm in town."
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,3,11/7/13,"My brother took me here for dinner on my first night in Berlin since this was just a short walk from his apartment. It's a very low-key and quiet restaurant. Of course I've been so used to eating at NY restaurants where the noise level is quite high. So at first it felt a little awkward that I had to talk in a hushed voice since there wasn't even background music at this restaurant. The menu is supposed to be French bistro but aside from a few dishes it was still very much oriented to German cuisine. My brother ordered the goulash and I had this dish that were sort of like mini burger patties. It was good and I was happy with the meal but I didn't think it was particularly French. The creme br?l?e, though, was very good. The price point was also reasonable and a carafe of wine was inexpensive enough that I happily indulged myself."
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,5,5/13/15,"I went there for the charcuterie mentioned on their web site...they didn't have it! I was sorely disappointed at first to find and get to this place, and then no charcuterie...The chef came to our table and in response to our questions he unabashedly said: ""I cook the best mussels in the world!""You know he was absolutely right...at least they were the best I've ever tasted!I just could not believe a plate full of mussels would be the best meal of my life!  But it was!!!The sauce was so exceptional, I could not stop eating it. I cleaned my entire plate...had some delicious French cheese...the best cheese I've ever had with a baguette for desert. Nothing beats unpasteurized French cheese!This restaurant deserves 5 stars...SUPERB!Michael KnappFrom Medford, OR to Berlin to Gar?on and the best meal of my life!"
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,5,10/5/12,"This is another one of those quaint and quiet places around my neighborhood that offer awesome brunch options. Being just a couple of blocks from my house, my companion and I tried this one morning. This place has a clear French bent to it, so the offerings were very interesting.I tried the Montand breakfast platter, which consists of a huge selection of French charcuterie; assorted meat, pates, and so on. It comes with bread on the side. He on the other hand ordered the Melville, which is similar to mine, but with the addition of cheese, egg, and orange juice. I was also impressed with the way they did the hot chocolate, with all its foamy goodness.The ambience was great as well. There are several nooks and crannies inside, so every seat almost feels as private as one's own dining table at home. And with the smiling lady waiting on us, it feels awesome, to just sit down, kick back, relax, and eat breakfast while chatting away nonchalantly.I am slowly learning that my neighborhood is filled with these small mid-to-upscale restaurants. I am glad we found this one, as this is another one of those places where I would love to come back again."
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,4,1/8/15,"I went to Gar?on today as I was in the area and had to eat before an appointment. Thanks to Jeruen's review, I tried it and after having eaten all of the Gratin Dauphinois which brought back memories of having eaten this dish quite frequently in times gone by. I was impressed with the side-salad as the dressing was watery yet super flavourful, I know it was mustard but must have also had horseradish in it. There also wasn't one bit of iceberg lettuce on my plate which thrills me to no end!!!I will definitely return!"
Gar?on,French,4,?11-20,1,2/23/16,"Yes, sadly, I like the food, and the service has been ok most of the time. I've been about 12 times- breakfast and dinners, weekdays and weekends.  But what happened last night speaks to a bigger problem. Last night the waiter spilled a glass of red wine on my friend's shirt, jacket and trousers - while he was sitting facing the wall of the restaurant. He never saw it coming. The waitress was startled and somewhat indifferent as we reached for the salt and he and I went to the bathroom to save the shirt. (I gave him the shirt off my back, that was under my hoodie). She came later and said they he should give them the dry cleaning bill.  He lives in Copenhagen, so that's not easy. To make matters worse, the three other parties at the table paid the bill and left a tip (including me). He refused to pay and the manager called the police.  Really? A nice shirt, jacket and trousers ruined by red wine and they make you pay or call the police.  That's just not acceptable at a restaurant like this.  I don't care that they have insurance and need to see the bill for cleaning.  The profit on the meals at the table would have easily covered the lost couple of Euro for his meal."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,11/23/17,"best burger in berlini had the special truffle burger week of 23rd november 2017 totally amazingalso i recommend the mix fries + north sea ipa"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,10/26/17,"Really good burgers, nice variations Try the special burger that changes every week, the mango dip is AMAZING and you can order mixed fries- sweet potatoe and normal ones. They have nice drinks like fresh tea, and gave us blankets as we had to sit outside because it was so full :)"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,7/7/17,"One of the best burgers I've ever tasted!The waiters were friendly, kind, and very efficient. They serve the best sweet potato fries, and you were offered the possibility of a mix with regular fries. I highly recommend their ""Rembrandt Burger"" with goat cheese and walnut. Furthermore if you like a smokey burger, my boyfriend had the BBQ burger and loved it. They serve the dutch pilsner grolsch, which goes great with burger. The Dutch burger restaurant isn't big, but has a nice atmosphere where you're able to talk with your date. Seating outside is also a possibility, and is highly popular in the summer."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,1,5/13/17,"Food was really good (see below) but: Cash only. Its 2017. Come on guys. Debit should be minimum. Tasty burger (cheeseburger)The pattie is made from organic meat so for me it was worth the 9,50?. You can choose two different buns which is always a plus for me. The pattie was pretty strongly seasoned but the overall taste was really good so it did not really matter. Good burger for a decent price."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,7/12/16,"Just go there! Best burger place in Berlin (and yes, I've tried The Bird and Burgeramt before). Their sweet potato fries are extremely delicious, the hamburgers too (I had the Amsterdam burger) and the service is amazing. It's however small so make sure to make a reservation in advance! I ordered by hamburger without the bun and got a salad on the side. Will definitely come back!"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,12/12/15,"Hands down. These are the best burgers in Berlin. Don't try to convince me otherwise.Their menu is not crazy big but has a exquisite selection of burgers which are well done. Decide between cheezy burgers with onions or spicy ones with a smoky sauce. The buns are great and the beef patties are fried perfectly, which leaves your burger all juicy and tender.You can also have vegan burgers here without leaving disappointed. They come with a tasty patty (well seasoned seitan I assume) and aromatic sauces. There won't be a reason to stare jealously on your friends plates.Make sure to choose their sweet potato fries as well because they are BOMB. Super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.I live like 40min away from this place and this jourmey is so so worth it."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,4,10/6/16,"A quite alright burger, not the ordinary you'd find in any burger joint. Beans, blue cheese, avocado and many more - they're all in there.Quite tasty but rather pricey."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,3,7/6/16,"I went with the 'Smokey Dutch' burger and the sweet-potato fries which both came highly recommended by another reviewer. I must admit that expectactions were set pretty high. Perhaps that's why the disappointment was so great. The burger didn't taste much at all, not even with bacon and BBQ-sauce. The fries were just, well fries. Not spectacular or anything. It was a big portion though, both the burger and the fries. Friendly service and all that.But, I'm sorry to say, I've had better burgers."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,4,9/23/14,"This is one of those burger joint, I'm going to visit a lot. Their focus is good all round burger. Good meat, good buns (white or whole grain) good cheese, and greens. And the fries are hot and crisp.They use browned onions, and it works quite good.Children can have their own burgers; special made for youngster."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,7/12/15,"Great for vegans/vegetarians!! We specially enjoyed their sweet potato fries. They took a little bit to cook our order but it was totally worth it! Their seating area is nice and cosy. We shared our table with some great people and  we had the chance to chat with them. All in all, this place is great for a nice, filling and friendly lunch!"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,6/19/17,"Super nice staff (also speak English if needed), amaaaaaazing food (the other reviews were totally right about the sweet potato fries!), and decent drink selection.  Not cheap but do you want quality food and service or just cheap food? I paid 14? for a delicious chicken burger with avocado, s??kartoffel pommes and craft beer. Not bad and the service and ambience are worth the visit! Don't miss it :)"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,4,2/20/14,"I didn't bring lunch today, so I took the opportunity to try out a new restaurant for lunch. So this time, I headed to Friedrichshain and searched for this burger joint. I got there around 13:00, which was prime lunch time. However, as it was in a quiet street a little north of Karl Marx Allee, there wasn't a crowd, just a handful of other diners in other tables. As it was my first time there, I ordered the restaurant's namesake burger, the Rembrandt Burger. It had blue cheese and walnuts in it, plus very luscious salad greens. I loved it. It also came with fries, which were crisp and not soggy at all.At 8,90 EUR, the burger was priced well. My meal, including a soft drink, was less than 11 EUR. They do the burgers medium only, and there is no option to make it well done. This is a cosy place, and while the burgers as well as the ambiance puts them a notch higher than those burger joints that are cheap and attracts late-night party goers, this is also not a swanky bring-your-companion-and-have-a-date-night type of place. The only thing I wish that wasn't was its location, as Friedrichshain isn't the most accessible neighborhood given my habitat."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,10/15/15,"Without a doubt, the best burger location in Friedrichshain, and the best sweet potatoe fries in the City.Bring a bit of patience here, because the order can get a while until they get on your plate."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,4,2/17/17,"5 stars for the burger! Got the grilled veggie burger with extra guac and sweet potato fries. The burger tasted great. They also have great homemade dips, try their sage mayo. The missing star goes to the fries that just weren't as great"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,7/29/16,So good I went twice. Go for the Rembrandt burger and curry sauce. Small beer selection but it's all good cause it's dank
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,5/17/16,"YES. I love everything about this place. They have a selection of Dutch snacks (frikandel, bitterballen, kaassoufle) and amazing burgers. Service is friendly and fast. They serve massive burgers with a lot of fries, but if you're not that hungry (or you are cursed/blessed with a tiny stomach) they have an option for a smaller version of the same menu. ""Ohne Brot bitte"" will get you a nice little salad to go with the burger instead of the bun. They even added some strawberries. Best part: bottles of mayonnaise on the table. Because there is no such thing as too much mayo."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,6/4/14,"Heard quite a bunch of people talking about this gem which is a few blocks away from my house, so I came here for lunchWe ordered a krokant (or however you spell it) for starters, and it was quite good.For the main dish I had the smokey Dutchman and it was the bomb! A few good points --beef is great and tasteful- mayo and ketchup are on the table-two types if spicy sauces! Fun! -amazing sweet potato fries-great service, also English speaking-they only have fried onions and not fresh ones, to me it is a climax. And no additional cost as well, like most places do. -they have an option for whole wheat bread, again, with no additional cost. Had a really good experience and I'm happy I have such a good burger place close to my house, I'm coming again!"
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,10/7/15,"It's not a typical burger place, where you run in and get a burger, but rather a restaurant to sit down and stay for a while. They have an outside and inside area, both look nice and you can see that they paid attention to the detail. Just make sure to either reserve a table upfront (only half of all tables can get reserved, the other half is open for casual customers) or bring some time. Since this is a place with very delicious food, it can be packed even during the week. The employees are very nice and friendly, I'm happy to leave a tip.The burgers are very unique and have that special Dutch touch. Every burger comes with fries, and for 1? extra you get them made out of sweet potatoes, plus you can choose the bread if you wish. The burgers are simply incredible and very tasty! For me, it's the best burger in Friedrichshain.I'm rating all burgers I've tried in Berlin, and I give this one a 9/10."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,10/31/13,"Very nice and cosy location with the best burgers and fries in the neighborhood. Love the peanut sauce...!They use meat from Neuland, meaning it's organic and of superb quality."
Rembrandt-Burger,Burgers,4.5,?11-20,5,8/14/15,"This is by far our favorite burger joint. The quality of the food is great. We tried all of their burgers. The meat is very good quality, and cooked to perfection. The bread is nice. The salad inside is fresh, and the rocket salad adds a little kick that I really appreciate. The sweet potato fries are the best in town. The normal fries are nothing special, but you do get a good portion. My wife likes to take a mini burger: you can chose any of the burgers, and you get it in small size, with a small ( not that small ) fries. this for half the price ! you can have full wheat bread. Also, you have a super chicken burger, and a large variety of veggie burgers ( never tried, the man needs meat... ;) )The sauces are really good too, and fresh. They keep them in the fridge so that it stays perfect.... The prices are fair, the waitresses are friendly, man i love this place... go for it... !!!!"
Masteca e Tasi,Italian,5,?11-20,5,1/31/15,"My favorite restaurant for a business lunch! Menu changes every week and dishes are always fresh and seasonal, with some regional italian gems not easy to find elsewhere. Real italian cuisine (and chef!). Staff is super friendly. For lunch I strongly recommend to book in advance or be there early, since the place is quite small and it?s always full after 1pm."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,5,9/25/11,"The best thing about an Italian restaurant is always the atmosphere In this restaurant run by Salvatore and Felix this is sure to receive. The food is made with the with Italian love for food.Suggest you all put on your list to go to when in Prenzlauer Berg."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,2,12/2/15,"Wandering around Berlin I came just to Trattoria Felice.With a pure heart I can say that for the first time in Berlin I found a great waitress who likes his job because, clearly, it can be seen and knows savavr vivre.The place is friendly animals. The dog got even water and dog cookies.Let's get to the menu. Prices very high. I could not find my taste pizza, firmly contrived. Everything looks appetizing, but the pizza does not impress.We have spent more than 30 euros and we were disappointed, because we could eat much better for this money."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,5,1/18/17,"I love this place. Beautiful interior design, great service and morst importantly: wonderful food and drinks. Had a vegetarian pizza, a salad and white wine. Will be back!"
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,1,2/14/16,"Food is not good at all, the speed of cooking is too soon. I think everything is all made up not home made, I am wondering how they got all these stars."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,4,4/3/15,"We got a table without reservation, but the place was completely packed, noisy and chaotic. What I like about this Italian restaurant is that they also serve non-pizza and pasta dishes, like the meats and fishes you'd also expect in Italy. Nevertheless we decided to stick to pizza, because it was so warm and crowded that we did not want to stay too long, also the meat dishes were slightly too expensive for our taste (24 euros or so) and therefore not suitable for a 'quick bite'. Negative thing was that the counter with cash register was next to our table and as a result the waiters were continuously yelling close to my girlfriends ears to communicate with each other over all the inside noise, which was quite annoying. This got worse when some live music entertainment started,  so although the music was great we were too bothered and annoyed by the (nonetheless) friendly waiters.The pizzas were good though - a bit undercooked and too salty, but nice and thin, good ingredients and richly covered.Four stars because all the food we saw looked great and we know that the experience would've been better on any other night than this one. We'll come back on a weekday to get this confirmed."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4,?11-20,3,7/18/12,"Not bad, not all that great  The pasta dish with Parmesan and truffle was really outstanding, but the overall atmosphere wasn't all that great. I like it when an Italian restaurant can make me feel like being in Italy  here you know you're in an Italian place in Germany. Also while serving us, the owner had more of an eye for new customers coming in, than concentrating on who he was serving.Whoever is used to a pizzeria thinks this is great, if you expect somewhat more it was a bit disappointing.Nice food but I would not come back again soon. 3,5 stars"
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,11/25/17,"CASH ONLY and they do ask you to leave tip!If you want to experience real german food, this is the place to go. It is very loud though-- seemed like a lot of students were there. And at one point, there was live music but it was more loud than nice lol they also did come around asking to give them money. They have amazing food and beer but it was very very hard to get the servers' attention. They also did not let us in at first because we did not make a reservation. Make sure to call before you go, they all speak English very well."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,1/14/18,"There was a live band, friendly staff and overall great lively atmosphere. Typical German food. It was all very yummy at a great price. I would recommend making a reservation because they looked really packed. I wasn't thrilled about the location...we couldn't find much to do around the area afterwards."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,11/15/17,"Fantastic and absolutely lovely restaurant. The staff is phenomenal and the menu, of course is traditional and to die for"
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,3/3/17,"Delicious food !I was taken here by my friends who have lived in Berlin for a while when I asked them to take me to an authentic restaurant,I had the Berliner soup - potato, sausage and bacon. It was delicious.I shared the carnivore platter- oh my more meat then I could ever eat!I tried the Schnitzel and it was delicious! Highly recommend!"
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,9/10/17,"Pretty good authentic German food and atmosphere. We had the pork knuckle and sausages, and portion sizes were huge. Beers were really decent as well. Maybe the only negative is that the service can be a bit stuffy at times."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,1,12/30/17,"We visited on a busy night (that before new years) and were told that they were busy and that we should sit at the bar while ""a table was cleaned off."" We were a party of TWO, young people. 10 minutes into waiting an older couple WITHOUT RESERVATIONS walked in and was seated within five minutes. We asked what was up and the same VERY DRUNK server told us that he had no idea and that we could sit at the communal table. We decided to finish the drinks we were PRESSURED into ordering and tried to leave; however this was delayed by the DRUNK bartender's inability to remember the price of their drinks as well as her inability to do simple math. LITERALLY THE MOST INCOMPETENT, DISCRIMINATORY STAFF EVER ENCOUNTERED. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,6/4/16,"My rating is at 3.5 stars but I rounded up for good measure. We were turned onto Max & Moritz restaurant by Yelp and took a recommendation for traditional/regional food from a local (who works at a trendy, not known for great food/experience Gastropub) to go there. M & M is a old school traditional restaurant that brews their own beer and serves local and national beers on draught. The restaurant stays true to its pre-war roots with a very traditional style. The restaurant itself is very warm and a bit smoky by the bar and obviously outside at the outdoor tables. It lacked any kind of air flow and, to top it off, each table was lavished with a candle to set the ambiance and heat level higher. The interior of the restaurant is what I'd expect for a traditional German restaurant, however. M & M was bustling with large groups, both friends and family-everything from a toddler and her parents to raucous 20 and 30-something year old males slugging back liters of beer. One such male took it upon himself to play a classical piece on the piano which sounded nice but in reality the acoustics were pretty bad and the echo wasn't enjoyable. I was impressed with the size of the menu and the fact that they had a ""vegetarian"" section on the menu. I enjoyed seeing the Berliner section with entrees specific to Berlin. Nice, complimentary bread was served with the meals. Servers and the hostess were nice and spoke English and there was an English menu which was also appreciated. With a severe lack of German restaurants in the area (and, to my surprise, more ""kepap"" places than I could count), this restaurant was a welcomed find. I enjoyed my meal but the overall atmosphere left some things to be desired."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,3/13/16,"Pretty good restaurant for german / berlin food. Beware that the food comes in a very hugeeee portion and tastes pretty goodWe got the berlin pork feet einsbein and it was humongous ... Tastes great as wellThen i got the rippenspeer (small) but it was hugeee i could not finish it!Service was great. Super friendly and english is spoken (plus english menu!)They also gave you complimentary bread! But unlike what yelp says, there is no wifi."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,2,6/4/16,"Hot as hades and not even a stir of air in the main back room. Horrible acoustics. Loud. Echoey.Is this meaty authentic Berliner cuisine? Yes. Pork foot. Sauerbraten. Goulash. Lamb stew. A couple veggie options and some salads. Large portions. Fair to slightly spendy pricing. Lots of beers being served up.A few tables outside but all occupied and full of smokers. The restaurant inside was uncomfortable in June. So hot and stuffy I was thankful when someone walked by as the air stirred. My conclusion is that yes, this is a traditional German food experience and this is also why there aren't more of this type of place. Loud boorish atmosphere in shabby hot place. I blew out the candle at our table because it was only making things worse. Who wants to dine uncomfortably? Not me. No thanks. If you're intoxicated enough you might not mind being all sweaty."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,1/18/17,"Food was great, very large portions.  Very authentic taste and cooking methods.  Great place for legitimate German food.  The waitstaff was cold towards us, even though I speak German.  Overall it was an enjoyable meal."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,3/12/17,"Delicious, the kitchen was a little slow but the waitress made sure to make us aware of this before we ordered. Food was well worth the 40 minute wait."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,9/7/16,Authentic and delicious German food. We are visiting from New York City and have been a couple of days here in Berlin and definitely this is a restaurant that you have to visit. They give you big and delicious food
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,5/13/15,"A vegetarian's perspective: Located in the buzzy heart of the Kreuzberg district, Max Und Moritz turned out to be one of the favourite finds of our Berlin trip. Its very much a traditional beer house, one thats been serving very hearty German food and hospitality since the beginning of last century. The whole place just oozes character and the same could be said for the staff who were universally jolly, had a great sense of humour, and were well clued up on Scottish current affairs!I was in awe of the staff's ability to converse in so many languages and resolved that I must do better with my efforts to speak German. I was so pleased to find vegetarian options on the menu that were actually labelled as such, and even had a few tips from our waiters about what was good. My meat free meal was full of cheesy noodley spaetzle goodness and well complemented by a fresh salad. The meat eaters were equally impressed and fit to burst!It almost goes without saying that the beers were excellent, it is an historic beer house after all, and we did our best to work through the beer menu sampling as many as possible. Tough job but someone has to do it!Food and drink wise, prices were pretty fair for a major city bar restaurant, and definitely cheaper than our hotel. I fell in love with Berlin and hope one day to make a return visit to Max and Moritz. Loved it!"
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,4,6/14/16,"This was recommended by our Sandeman Tour Guide, and I'm really glad we came. The food was wonderful and the beer tasty, and the menus had English on them. We sat on the second floor by a window and just got to relax and enjoy the district. It's pricier than we were hoping to spend, however it was certainly worth it. Everything we had was delicious: the house pickled beets and cabbage, the salads were fresh, the homemade food was incredible, everything rocked. It was very good. It's also cash only, which is a bummer, but we had the cash. All in all, I'm glad we came here, I'm happy with it."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,3,4/1/15,"It really takes a lot to get this girl to Kreuzberg but I couldn't pass up an opportunity to try this place. Having heard such mixed reviews about Max & Moritz, I needed to try it and did...I was brought as a guest for a large group dinner and the food was the exactly same as if we had all ordered our own plates (it was serve yourself). The bread selection was pretty good and the sp?tzle was very authentic but other than that, I felt the rest of the food was only a bit above average. They also have a very small wine by the glass selection and although the wine I ordered was pretty good, I would have liked a few more options. I think that the place could be a little intimidating for a first timer.The decor, though, is great and the bar adds a nice touch to the front entrance. It is definitely a very original place to check out but I don't know if I would schlepp all the way to Kreuzberg for another meal there."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,3,7/9/16,"Everyone in the staff that we encountered did something to make us feel unwelcome. We should have probably just left after seeing such attitude. First, the host shook her head and stopped paying attention to us upon hearing that we didn't have a reservation. Then, a passing waiter pointed at a bottle of water in my hand and told me it was not allowed inside. Then, the waiter kept ignoring us in every possible way. She would stop by the three tables around us frequently and would just look turn her head away from us every time she would be nearby. The food was oversalted, the decor is run down and the air is stuffy and hot."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,3,6/26/15,"The food is okay at most but my biggest complaint is the service. Service is extremely slow. It literally took at least 45 mins to get the check. I actually had high expectations for Max & Moritz so I was utterly disappointed when I visited Berlin. Plus, you have to make reservations way in advance or else a walk-in wait is aroudn 2 hrs during busy dinner time..."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,11/4/15,"Highly recommended. My companion and I searched high and low for some Sauerbraten and finally found some at Max und Moritz. Very nice location inside, servers were friendly and helpful for us English mostly speakers. The Sauerbraten was excellent but my favorite had to be the Goulash."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,5,12/9/12,"I love this place.  Good food, good people and good waiters.  You have to try the potato soup, the local breaded fish and if you are adventurous like my friends, try the pork knuckle-see the picture.  The restaurant hosts music on certain nights.  They have a full bar.  Great rustic look to the place.  Gorgeous waitresses who know how to imbibe."
Max & Moritz,German,4,?11-20,3,12/28/15,"Food is alright, but we had better schnitzel and sauerbraten before. Overrated place."
Pastificio Tosatti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/27/17,"Enjoyed visiting this pasta place.Matteo Tosatti is uber friendly owner of the place who makes all kind of pasta by himself in front of the guests.I can only advice going there, because this place satisfies you in everything : nice atmosphere, fancy design, good people working there and very-very good food.grazie mille!"
Pastificio Tosatti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,7/30/16,"Freshly homemade pasta, regularly changing menu, good drink selection and desserts. Also super authentic and super nice"
Restaurant Le Faubourg,French,4.5,?21-40,5,10/20/13,"Absolutely amazing! Real fine dining, food quality was perfect the combination of flavours was amazing as well. Service: Good (8/10)Decoration: Good (8/10)Food: Perfect (10/10)"
Restaurant Le Faubourg,French,4.5,?21-40,4,11/17/17,"Everything was delicious. As a native Georgian (US state not the country) I have to commend the German restaurants on their quality of butter. Faubourg is spacious, quiet and sophisticated. It has a prie fixe menu. It was almost as if they knew some southern ladies were coming to clutch our pearls, I declare and bless their hearts. Turnips, catfish and pecan-tart as dessert was on the menu for a lovely Friday 3 course lunch. The celery soup was delectable although I'm not sure what was in the little canap? on the bowl rim. The catfish main dish was succulent, although I didn't like the flat leaf parsley and greenery on top. Everything underneath the catfish was excellent and the catfish itself. The pecan tart was fabulous, I wish I could make it for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner to impress my family and shame my exes new girlfriends. Had some champagne (please pronounce ""sham-pag-knee"") cause we're classy and it's a celebration. 4 stars cause I was still a bit hungry, but maybe I was greedy lumpkins that day."
Restaurant Le Faubourg,French,4.5,?21-40,4,9/27/16,"Good food and service. The only thing negative I have to say about this place is the background music, which is a combination of an elevator music and a new edge conference."
Restaurant Le Faubourg,French,4.5,?21-40,5,8/16/15,"This restaurant is located in the Sofitel Kudam. I dined here twice during a recent 10-day stay in Berlin (and the Sofitel). I was also traveling alone and did not feel awkward about dining there alone. The menu is French with classic bistro option, but the hook here is that many of the entrees can be prepared either in the classic way or a modern interpretation. I had the filet one evening and a halibut option the next - both were outstanding. There was also a pate appetizer that was memorable for both its taste and presentation. The service was the best I had in Berlin - very personable and attentive."
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,5,12/2/16,"They speak English here! Maultaschen, or meat dumplings, is a traditional dish from the Region of Baden-W?rttemberg, in the South of Germany. All dishes are manually prepared. There is an old story saying that the people eat those meat dumplings during the fasting time because God will not be able to see that they are eating meat! Try them with the excellent regional beer!"
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,4,8/14/17,"Really enjoyed this place. Unfortunately it was pretty late by the time we got seated, so I wish I ordered more food! Friendly service and as you'd expect fantastic Maultaschen."
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,4,7/5/15,"I met a friend for dinner here last Thursday. We made a reservation over the phone, which was quite painless. Thursday evening came, it was hot, and so we opted to sit inside, where it was a tad cooler.My companion and I ordered the vegetarian maultaschen, and they had spinach with mozzarella, as well as dried tomatoes and goat cheese. One could even mix them. I had mine with fried potatoes instead of potato salad. Alas, I was sick, sick enough to go to the hospital in an ambulance. It wasn't their fault, it was due to a previous health issue. I asked them if they could pack up our orders for takeaway instead, which they gladly did. We then took a cab home, and my companion ate her order at home. I didn't touch mine until I returned from the hospital two days later.I know this is an unfair review. But I have to say, that they were very much accommodating. I am sorry I didn't get to try their food properly, but at least the one I tasted, as well as their service, merits me trying to get back here and eating again, properly seated, at table, this time."
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/22/16,"Great local feel to a place just off a somewhat busy street. The place was filling up on a Saturday night, and it was easy to see why. Delicious Swabian food! I had the J?gerart Maulthausen - yum! Mellow vibe and attentive but not obtrusive service. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,5,8/14/15,THIS PLACE IS HELLLLLLA GOOOD! The ravioli is delicious and it tastes fresh. i got the classic and asked the waiter to add in the eggs. my friends got the mushroom and vegetarian one. THIS PLACE IS A MUST
Maultaschen Manufaktur,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/31/15,"No English menu, and they DO NOT take credit cards.. HOWEVER! The service and the food is, by far, excellent!!! It's a small, intimate restaurant but it has a big heart. Would definitely come back here again!"
Gasthaus Julchen Hoppe,German,4,?11-20,4,5/26/17,"Ended up eating dinner here after checking out the TV Tower which is close by. At 8pm on a Friday the restaurant was fairly empty so we got to pick our table. The waitress stopped by with menus and took our beverage orders shortly after sitting down. At first her demeanor was not friendly at all, but by the end of our meal she was all smiles.We decided on the Berlin pork knuckle, beef roulade  (per the suggestion of our waitress), and the kid's chicken and fries. Both main dishes were really good, but I preferred the pork knuckle a little bit more. Loved how the skin was crispy and the pork was tender. The potatoes topped with bacon bits went well with the knuckle. I really enjoyed the sauerkraut, which had a little sweetness to it. The roulade was seasoned nicely and didn't need all the sauce that accompanied it. I thought the boiled potatoes were just okay and could have used some salt. I thought the apple cabbage was just okay too. I also tried a piece of the kid's chicken, which was surprisingly really good. You could tell the nuggets were made fresh and with real chicken breast (no fillers). Washed down with a pilsner or wheat beer (super cheap... ?4.80 for a large!), this made a great first dinner in Berlin."
Gasthaus Julchen Hoppe,German,4,?11-20,5,6/27/16,"The schnitzel was amazing...tender, flavorful, and moist. The best sauerkraut I have ever tasted! Great cucumber salad too. The waitress was pleasant and engaging and spoke perfect English. This was just the taste of Germany we were looking for!"
Gasthaus Julchen Hoppe,German,4,?11-20,2,8/9/16,"We came to this restaurant because of the decent Yelp reviews but I found it seriously underwhelming. It started off well with a round of beers. I ordered the Roulade and it was probably one of the top 5 driest meats I have ever tasted... texture of cardboard. Even the large amounts of sauce didn't help. My friends ordered schnitzel and chicken and were equally unimpressed. Service was incredibly slow, our whole meal took around two hours, around 45 minutes was us just waiting around. Granted the server was nice, just not present. We went there around 8 but the restaurant was quite empty, so the servers seemed to stay in the kitchens. Maybe we went on an off day. I certainly hope so because this was probably one of the most mediocre meals I enjoyed in Germany. Two stars instead of one because the restaurant was very aesthetically pleasing, certainly looked its part."
Gasthaus Julchen Hoppe,German,4,?11-20,3,1/22/15,"The different areas of this restaurant feel like different establishments. In the front there are great benches and tables and is likely a lovely place to have a pint (er I mean half-liter) when it isn't below freezing. Upon entering, there is a snug little bar that was overflowing with police officers and men in military uniform (I guess there is no prohibition about drinking in uniform here). To the left is a dining area reminiscent of a french country style kitchen. To the right is something that is a cross between a ship and a log cabin. We went to the right.This is certainly in a tourist area and while everyone else there was German, they were probably not locals. The food is traditional german so we had bratwurst and pork with lots of sauerkraut and potatoes. It may have been pretty standard, but the portions were huge. I heard other tables laughing at the size of their plates as well. They have English menus and the waitstaff all speak English but easy enough to get by with a combo of pointing and broken German. Decent beers on tap. Prices are a little high but not too crazy if you order smartly."
Gasthaus Julchen Hoppe,German,4,?11-20,5,5/4/15,"Excellent service and food! Boyfriend and I came late (21.00) on a Sunday but the nice waitress didn't make a fuss. We ordered beef roulade and sausage meals which were both delicious! If you want a quaint authentic German meal, come here!!"
La Casserole,French,4.5,?21-40,5,5/18/15,"Truly, this is as good as it gets! Owned by a  lovely Tunisian couple, the husband trained as a French chef, this small, intimate restaurant excels in beautifully prepared and presented meals: excellent fish dishes; fresh, often surprising, veggies (like celery root) and soups; and exquisite lamb cuisines. [There are other meat dishes on the menu that I haven't tried. Basically vegetarian, I break my tradition on visiting this establishment because of their special talent with lamb.] The service and the ambience makes you feel as though you are visiting friends who decided to treat you like special guests and cook a gourmet meal for you. My husband and I visit Berlin a couple of times a year, and we find that Casserole's quality has not diminished. It's a treat I look forward to."
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/17/16,"Family-style Italian restaurant with a great selection of pizza, pasta, salads, and antipasti. Simple, hearty food for a cozy dining experience. A nice selection of house wines, too. This isn't fine dining, and that's just fine with me. Simply good food for a good price. The owner/proprietor is an extremely welcoming and friendly woman. Makes you feel like you're always welcome. Highly recommended!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/15/16,"After HOURS of researching the perfect place for our final meal on our Berlin trip, I came across Marechiaro. We were looking for something non-German, quaint, and in a less busy neighborhood, yet somewhere cozy that had great food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. I think this place fit the bill nicely! It was a nice night out and many people showed up to the restaurant wanting an outdoor table, so the employees took almost all of the tables out to the sidewalk to appease everyone. My wife and I stayed inside, though.The proprietors were super helpful. The menu and specials were all in German and they translated everything for us without a fuss. As we came to experience in Berlin, service in general is just slower than in the US. But this was the only place we ate where they acknowledged and apologized for the wait, which was nice.The food was freshly prepared and we agreed our entrees and appetizer were great. If they are serving it, I'd recommend the spaghetti with lemon cream sauce and tiger shrimp."
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/19/17,"Perfect food, very good serviceWe enjoyed every moment.We ate bruschetta and two kinds of pasta and the taste was amazing!!!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/31/15,"went with 3 friends, none of spoke Italian nor German. Didn't matter!  The owner was adorable. She made us feel welcome. best Italian food outside Italy!  Go and have dinner. You won't be sorry."
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/14/14,"Maybe a bit slow,But really the best Italian food with fresh ingredients, awesome pizza and pasta. Every ingredient is delicious !!!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,12/8/12,It is a small eatery with fine pizzas. the service here was very friendly and the food served was fresh.
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,5,7/3/15,"I absolutely love this restaurant! The atmosphere is lovely, and it's beautifully decorated with lots of peony. The food is delicious and delicate. There's a five-course menu that looks fantastic, but I don't feel like eating one of the course with venison, so I skipped the five-course and ordered sushi instead. I also ordered the dessert called the vegan, and it's so creative and tasty! The service is really good here too."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,4,12/3/16,"NB-- I've only visited this restaurant as a hotel guest, using rates where breakfast was included. We have once paid for an additional guest, and the breakfast buffet did feel a bit steep. We always enjoy the brunch buffet when we're staying at the Grand Hyatt. There are a number of items which can be cooked to order, but the buffet is very solid as well. They have a good hot food selection, including eggs, potatoes, etc. Lots of nice cheeses, and fruits and breads are good as well. At least on the weekend, there is German sparkling wine available to pour for yourself (it tasted better than I expected, knowing little about German wine, and reminded me of a dry cava)The weak point is service. It can range from decent to downright bad, with them forgetting to bring tea or coffee, or mixing up items. When it's a ""free"" breakfast it doesn't feel like it matters as much, but if you're paying top euros for a meal, you would expect decent service. For an international hotel, I feel like this is the element they really could work on.My favourite bit is the terrace, where there are comfortable seats and shaded awning, a lovely way to spend a warm morning."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,1,10/27/16,"The food is atrocious. I'll give you, I'm an American, the German cuisine is tough on my palate, but this wasn't even German food. Everything is some strange Asian or Indian fusion. EACH DAY of my stay, at a work function, all I ate was a buttered roll for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was more acceptable but just barely. Horrible dining experience."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,3,11/23/14,"Well, this one is tough to rate. I joined the Hyatt Gourmet Club which gave me 50% on the bill when I brought someone else along. Therefore I have been in several Hyatt owned restaurants in Germany and I'm afraid the Berlin one is the worse. In fact, it's not really bad - it's just that you would expect more looking at the prices and the location. Their service is ok at best and suffers from the place always being crowded. The Sushi is pretty good and fresh but nothing special. For that prize you can get more and better Sushi in Berlin. Their normal dishes are interesting and often special but again are nothing special - just really ordinary. It was fine to eat there one year several times, but I'm good after that."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,3,3/13/16,"We guess the sushi is not anymore - the - we are going there throttle. But the Sake, the service and the sushi/ sashimi were better than with the usual Berlin suspects."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,5,4/4/15,"Quite nice environment and welcoming staff. We ordered lamb, steak, Sushi and lobster soup. All of them were served with delicacy and professional skills. The price is bit higher than other common restaurants, yet fine dining in a 5 star hotel restaurant is always worthwhile."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,4,2/14/13,"I eat here at least twice during the Berlin Film Festival. Love the sushi. Great service, but the waiters are very anal. (Which makes it funny)... Enjoyable."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,5,4/6/13,"This is a place I wish I could go to every week! Marvelous sushi and friendly, attentive staff. The wasabi was prepared right at our table. The bar is conveniently placed, just next to the restaurant, so you can carry your conversation over from one place to the next if you have good company."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,3,9/21/13,"Yea, I'm gonna go there. After 20 years of dining in the top Los Angeles sushi joints and having eaten at every big US city's top sushi places,  this place is what it is. Prices, eh...Quality, decent to good...Service, eh...Ambiance, comfortable...Sushi Chefs, could smile and engage more. Whataya want, it's sushi in the middle of a landlocked city...in Europe. Did it do the trick when hungry for raw bait, sure..."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,3,1/1/14,Quite good food - sushi is great - but service and atmosphere let it down. 10 minutes to get seated by an overworked ma?tre d' and the restaurant bustles with activity but not much actual service. Sitting next to a table of obnoxious Australians didn't help (I am Australian myself but this species seems to be colonising Berlin).
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,4,9/15/08,"This is a great place for lunch as the set menu is always very good and also very reasonably priced. Where else can one escape with 3 courses for 25 Euros including a glass of wine and coffee (and tip) in a top-class restaurant in the centre of Berlin? I used to come here years ago for dinners and this elegant place was instrumental for my decision to move into the area. But since I moved in, the management changed and the restaurant fell down a deep crevice in terms of quality and service. Over the last 2-3 years, I saw signs that they are crawling back up but they still have not quite made it back to their old apex. In the past, they would have easily qualified for a Michelin star. As it is, they still do not have one (and it shows) but they are charging prices as if they do. Oh, by the way, they also do the most expensive sushi in Berlin, which you can see hand-made by Japanese-looking cooks. There is a luxury cocktail bar lounge area just inside the restaurant where one can listen to great blues and soul music tinkled on the piano and sung by various artistes after dinner time. This is a wonderful lounge, if only the drinks were a little cheaper, but it's still worth coming here once in a while to pass the time away on a dull evening. The restaurant itself is a lovely place to dine and watch either (a) life moseying by in Alte Potsdamer Strasse, or (b) the cooks in action in the open kitchen. Both are entertaining, with my preference for the latter. The ambience is dark executive as befits the main restaurant of the best Grand Hyatt in Europe, but is intimate and cosy enough to bring friends along. Service is generally good and they even remember your name if you go there a few times. Or maybe they just remember weirdos like me. Some years ago, I recall that they had also mispriced a Chateau Margaux 1988 on their wine list and we took full advantage of that until they sold out. Ah, those were the days. Maybe it will get back to where it belongs but at the moment, the fact is Vox is a classy refined restaurant, with a great music lounge, serving good quality hotel food at premium hotel prices at dinner time. So the best deal there is their lunch set menu."
Vox Restaurant,Sushi Bars,4.5,Above ?41,5,12/14/00,"Close your eyes and think of EnglandThe only good reason to visit an expensive restaurant is the food, and ""Vox"" in the Grand Hyatt serves some of the very best food in Berlin. Almost indescribably good. And if you close your eyes and pretend that ""Vox"" is in London, it really doesn't seem so expensive after all!"
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,10/23/16,"My wife and I went with a business colleague to Le Midi for breakfast this morning.  It is a relaxed atmosphere with fresh ingredients and an unusually wide selection of cheeses, and has become a popular neighborhood hangout.  The bread is also excellent as are the fresh fruit slices served with each meal.  It also has the advantage of opening earlier than many other places, especially on Sunday.  If this kind of restaurant were available in my own neighborhood at home in the U.S. then I would go frequently."
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,12/4/16,"Cute cafe with French accoutrements. Popped in for a coffee, but wish I had brought an appetite! The beautiful French tarts looked mouthwatering, as did the extensive baguette sandwich menu. Note: the place gets packed tight at brunch on weekends. Better for a group of 2, not a big group."
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,6/6/16,"Good choice for an early morning breakfast in a French style. Quiet place in the lively Prenzlauerberg district. It has a small shop with several French products like food, wine and cidre."
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,4,2/28/15,"Small and cosy french (corsican) style restaurant. Varying meals every day, plus some things on the regular menu (breakfast, lunch sandwiches, french cheese/meat platter).We come here quite regularly because it is never really crowded (no need to make reservations - plus it's close to our home), the atmosphere is great and the food is good. The wine, starters and cheese platter are relatively cheap an good value for money. The main courses are slightly more expensive (~10 euro for the vegetarian options is a good price, but it goes up to 17 euro for some meat dishes). We had varying experiences with the main courses. We always loved the risottos, but sometimes got  a bit disappointed by the meat options, that are frequently served with just salad and with meat not always prepared perfectly. I would probably advice to combine one of their excellent (large portion) soups with a vegetarian or fish (more affordable) main course, and if your still hungry share a cheese platter. Together with some great red wine, candle light, good music and comfy chairs, this will be your perfect evening out."
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,4/27/13,"Ich vergebe 5 Sterne an Le Midi. Es ist ein sehr kleines Lokal, aber dadurch wird das Ambiente sehr originell, freundlich und angenehm. Die Bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam. Wir waren hier zum brunchen, sehr leckere Auswahl und gute Portionen. Es gibt aber auch richtige K?che. Ich w?rde jederzeit wieder einkehren :)"
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,3,2/12/10,"Cute place. Nice decor, but the seats in the window were uncomfortable, covered in crumbs and stained. Several places in Berlin suffer from this kind of ""looks cute when it is brand new furniture, but isn't comfortable and doesn't wear well"". My double espresso was good and the mascarpone torte we ate was delish!! Good music, friendly service. Going to go back to try the food."
Le Midi,Cafes,4.5,?11-20,5,3/16/11,"very nice tiny restaurant, excellent breakfast. you can even buy french/corse groceries! highly recommended"
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,8/10/17,"It is a perfect neighbors restaurant but also great for tourist, friends,  family and business.  Nice service and great food. The server explained about their food and ingredient as well as their farm,  Very kind and they speak good English.  Lovely decor and cosy and cute mountain decor, we really enjoyed it."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,7/3/16,"Franconian food in the heart of former east Berlin's Friedrichshain neighborhood. Franconian cuisine is a specific regional identity belonging to the region of Franconia. Think Southern Germany. It is a subtype of German cuisine with many similarities to Bavarian cuisine and Swabian cuisine. I happen to have been to these regions many times over and love the food, though I did know the provinces and the proper names. The smoked pork is roasted to crisp, the sausage orgy dish is funny named and is not for the faint of the heart (it's huge in size). Fried chicken is better than most of American fried chicken, and the potato pancakes are perfect. They are all HUGE in portion and completely wonderful for left over take-outs. When I checked in it had a check in special, but seeing that I did not need that special for coffee, the store owner brought me local sausages as free appetizers. It was quite lovely. For dessert, they had kaiserschmarrn and I ordered it, which I've not had since Prague 2012 and Austria 2001. So that was nice surprise. Fantastic service to boot. The price is extremely reasonable (for Americans anyway). Sometime like this will likely double in price in America.  Can't finish them all so I had box to take away. The place attract tourists for reasons I don't know. Or maybe everyone just read the English Yelp reviews and come here. I would love to come back for more."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,8/1/17,"Okay, so I generally do not eat German food while I'm in Germany. Sit-down restaurants are often out of my price range, and especially in Berlin, plenty of Germans don't even eat German food. I ordered the wurst with sour kraut and was so happy to have done so, though my friend seemed to enjoy his schnitzel (it looked excellent to me) very much. The prices are reasonable and the service is good by European standards. Don't be afraid to hail (kindly) the server, and expect to sort out your payment while the person stands in wait (standard operating procedure)."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,9/6/16,"This was my first meal alone in Berlin and I made ALL of classic American tourist mistakes: didn't seat myself, didn't tip enough, left the tip on the table, etc. Despite behaving like an idiot baby, I very much enjoyed this meal!I sat on the patio and would recommend this, weather permitting. Next door is a little flower shop so my table was adjacent to some nice plants which really added to it all. I ordered a beer...two beers.... and a pork loin served with potato dumpling, gravy and a side of red cabbage. True, classic German food. It was INCREDIBLE. The pork was perfectly juicy throughout and crispy on top--it just fell off the bone. I sat there for way too long because I was savoring the meal too much. The service was good-- much better than the tip I left reflected. I think that there was some service included in the bill, but I still feel bad."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,5/22/16,"Absolutely outstanding! Want a meal that will bring back memories, food that gives a good sample of local fare, this is your place!  The staff was courteous, atmosphere quaint and relaxed, great enjoyable evening."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,6/24/16,"Great spot in Friedrichchain , Friday night and we got a patio table for 6. Tried the schnitzel which was definitely amazing, the pork shoulder could have been a bit more moist but was still delicious. Also the meatballs were very nice as well.The decor is up to date and proper both inside and their tables/chairs and linen outside. If you want nice German food I would recommend this for sure. Service was proper and efficient."
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,4,11/20/15,"If you want German food, go here. I had meatballs with boiled potatoes and my wife had duck with red cabbage and potato dumpling. Combinations we were not used to but a pleasant surprise.Nothing exotic or special, just good German food!"
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,12/14/15,Einfach nur toll. Go there and eat. The host and cook are two german originals. The food is mainly from Franken but you also get Wiener Schnitzel e.g.. There are also daily specials and a nice wine sortiment.
Friedrichs Wirtschaft,Cafes,4.5,?21-40,5,7/13/16,"First meal we ate in Germany, definitely did not disappoint! We tried many dishes and they were all fantastic."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,9/18/17,"First dinner in Berlin...spectacular!! Service? Awesome... one gal took care of everyone perfectly well.  Ambiance? Amazing... just like being in Italy! Food?...I mean...Out of this world!We had the fettuccine with veal, chanterelles &... wait for it...FRESH TRUFFLES! OMG! An absolute flavor explosion!!!! Hubby had linguine with parmesan butter sauce and...FRESH TRUFFLES! Super yummy fresh bread... smooth spectacular panna cotta...and the best Chianti I've ever had.  A lovely little place...a real treat. GO!!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,5/15/15,"I may be a little picky with my pasta but I was NOT super satisfied with my meal here. The atmosphere is pretty good and the fact that it is family owned and has FREE water is nice but aside from that and the appetizer I got (proscuitto and melon) I felt this place could have been a lot better.I got some of their handmade pasta (the one with mushrooms) and it was very lacking in the flavor department and the mushrooms were so small I could barely get them on the fork. It was very creamy and I felt like something green was missing... maybe some other vegetables? I don't know. My friend got pasta with shrimp and she said the shrimp was a bit dry and her pasta was slightly cold. Mine was steaming so I am guessing they waited for my food to be ready and hers ended up cooling while it waited. We got apple shorle and juice which is pretty inexpensive for the glass they give you.The waitress was busy and un-attentive and seemed stressed and agitated at times. I don't know if it was a bad night at the place because this it seems to have great reviews from a lot of people but I was just a bit disappointed and have no plans on returning. Wish everything else was as great as the proscuitto melon was."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/10/15,"This little Italian joint looks rather unassuming, but don't be fooled. I'd been craving home-made ravioli for a few weeks and when my lovely suggested this joint, I was stoked at the coincidence.  And boy, this ravioli was STUNNING!  With spinach sheets of pasta on one side, and regular on the other, they were just little pillows of orgasmic delight. Drenched in butter and sage, with a sprinkling of parmesan (oh man, my mouth is watering just at the memory again!) I almost couldn't finish the plate, I was savouring each morsel so slowly...And as a bonus, the staff are cute, and authentically Italian - I'd happily have come back day after day ;)"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/7/15,"This is an amazing little Italian gem in Berlin! I lived in Italy for about 6 months and this food is up there with some of my favorites in Rome and Florence. We started with the anti pasta and it was great! Fresh cheese and salami and prosciutto and in season veggies! Absolutely perfect. I ordered the carbonara...I usually never order creamy pasta but this carbonara is off the charts. It's traditional, the pasta was cooked perfectly with the egg and prosciutto. It wasn't too heavy or creamy because they didn't have to add cream because the egg did it for them. I don't think I've had carbonara better! I highly recommend it!! My friend ordered the spinach ravioli and she is Italian and very particular about pasta and she was also in heaven. The pasta was fresh the dough was light and the spinach just made the ravioli a delight. Overall a great atmosphere, good service  and great find. If you're in Berlin and you're craving great Italian food this is the place to go.  I wish I lived closer because i would become a regular."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,9/6/16,Mediocre place at best. Appearance and taste wise. We had the tagliatelle with truffles and the pasta Siciliana. Both were not flavorful and made without love. Would not recommend as you can find much better in the area.
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/13/15,"The food is delicious. No matter if you're, like me, not a great fan of Italian food, this is crazy delicious. And those tiny portion will make you full but still craving for more. I'm amazed of the quality. It's very tiny, so better reserve a table. The service is ok, it's more of a ""family/friends""-hospitality. Not that stuck in norms, they are friendly and nice. Although they could work out a smile once in a while. The rock classics playlist is not expected at a place like this, but it works well, it brings you in the mood. But why I wouldn't go all the way to a 5th star is that the music was...extremely loud...as I was there. And it wouldn't get any lower as the evening progressed.."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/10/15,"We found this restaurant by chance and it was fantastic! Some of the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy. I visited in the summer and sat on their patio. Almost all of the tables were full but they were quick to clean the tables when someone left so it helped with turnover. The menu came in English and German, making it easy as a tourist to order (even though this was off the beaten path to find to some degree). They offered a wide variety of pasta dishes, I went for the pasta with chanterelle mushrooms and it was really good. Served with more of a tomato sauce instead of a creamy alfredo type sauce that I was expected. I was pleasantly surprised. They brought bread at the beginning of the meal and provided us free water. The service was good when we needed something but otherwise gave us space which was also appreciated. I definitely plan to go back next time I'm in Berlin!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/16/14,"Def a 5 star candidate.The food was amazing, the wines so so tasty, the servers really nice and quick and the atmosphere is so Italian style. I love. Love. Love."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/24/15,"This place was a bit empty at 6:30, when we arrived, and we were a bit worried that it wouldn't be as good as we thought. But the waiter was really friendly and we got served really quickly since we were pretty much the only ones there. It filled up soon enough and was getting busy by the time we left. They brought us olives and fresh hot bread which were both great. I had the spaghetti bolognese and my mum had ravioli and both our dishes were AMAZING. Very flavourful, the spaghetti was perfectly cooked. The portions were really generous, we were very full by the end of the meal. Overall great meal!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/10/15,"OMG Berlin ... aMaZiNg, really ... Quaint, delish, friendly and romantic!  The food was fabulous, the service was suggestive and helpful, the ambiance exceeded all expectations.  2 Americans, a bottle of wine, casual yet sensual~#tastebudsgoneCray"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/23/15,Excellent choice for my husbands birthday dinner.  The perfect blend of authentic charming atmosphere and exceptional food.  We highly recommend the antipasti and ravioli marscapone.  The chianti reserve was a nice compliment in flavor and price!  We will return again during our stay in Berlin.
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/22/14,"My favorite Italian restaurant in Berlin.You feel like in Italia. The prices are very cheap for the neighborhood. The best dishes are for me the ravioli.The service are very nice with a nice italian accent ;)"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/8/15,"This is a small restaurant on Torstrasse. They offer a good choice of italian pasta dishes. We went for the 2 daily specials, pasta with truffles and pasta with scampi. Both dishes were good, but not great. They somehow lacked a bit of bold flavours and left us a little disappointed. The prices for the regular pasta are very good, around 6 EUR, the daily specials were considerably more expensive around 15 EUR. Given the ingredients this is ok. I will go back there and try the anti pasti plates, they looked delicious."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/2/13,"This is  a cozy original italian food trattoria...much better than many restaurants you could find now a days in Rome, believe me! They have great options for lunch menus. Their dishes are very authentic, original, and simple with great quality ingredients. I've been there for lunch and dinner. For lunch I had the spaghettis with sausage and tomato sauce...delicious! They totally nailed it!For dinner I had the spaghetti carbonara with truffle oil, it was creamy without being too overwhelming, just perfect! Recommended!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/8/14,"This was the best Italian meal I've eaten outside of Italy.  I was blown away.  The service,  atmosphere,  wine,  and food were all first rate. I wish I lived in Berlin,  or at least close by,  so I could enjoy it again.  The next time I cross the country to visit Berlin, this will be a stop.  I recommend a reservation for dinner, as this little place filled quickly.  Luckily we made one for my birthday and I'm so pleased we did."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/17/14,"Bedienung sehr nett, Pasta ist wahnsinnig lecker. Leider alles ein bisschen eng und klein, aber die Qualit?t stimmt und es lohnt sich hier einen netten Abend zu verbringen."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/2/11,"Really good pastas and antipasti. Some of the best Italian food I've eaten in Europe, including Italy."
Die Gute Stube,German,5,?11-20,5,2/24/17,"We approached this place with caution.  Our favorite place around the corner had closed, we were hungry and we found that this place was close by on Yelp.  The outside reveals nothing about this wonderful restaurant.  We opened the door and were immediately greeted by a number of patrons at the cozy bar.  This is a non smoking bar so none of that pesky smoke! We walked through the tiny bar to the dining area in the back.  There are only a few tables so keep your fingers crossed that you get one!  The bartender greeted us with menus and took our drink order.   The Chef came out and said ""I am here to take your order since I am cooking it!""  She was very pleasant and ready to please.   My wife ordered a small side salad and I ordered Weiner Schnitzel.  The Chef was unimpressed with my wife's order and chastised her for watching her figure!  I wanted french frys but the Chef encouraged me to try her homemade fried potatoes with the promise that I wouldn't be disappointed.  I wasn't!  When the food came out the Chef told my wife that she had brought two pieces of toast in addition to the small salad because one can not exist on salad alone and by the way, she had placed extra large portions of Schnitzel and potatoes on my plate because she was confident that my wife would want some of mine.   She wasn't wrong with that analysis.  The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and this is sure to be a regular stop for us while we are in Berlin. This is like taking a step back in German dining history.  The Chef was also the owner and took great pride in providing us with a memorable meal!"
Die Gute Stube,German,5,?11-20,4,12/4/17,This restaurant closed a little while ago due to the owners retiring.  In December 2017 it reopened under new management producing the same style of traditional Berliner food.
Die Gute Stube,German,5,?11-20,5,7/21/16,If looking for German food this is the place. Price level is reasonable!
Bogazici,Kebab,4,Under ?10,5,4/14/14,"One of the best Turkish kitchens around, always friendly and always tasty food. But don't mistake that place for a restaurant. It's still fast food."
Bogazici,Kebab,4,Under ?10,4,10/14/12,"Der Doenerladen meines Vertrauens  und das schon seit ungefaehr 10 Jahren!! Wenn Doener in Moabit, dann hier! Auch wenn die Bedienung zur Hauptgeschaeftszeit nicht immer die freundlichste ist  es muss dann eben etwas schneller gehen  so wurde ich bisher auch nie UNfreundlich behandelt. Und am wichtigsten ist immernoch die Top-Qualitaet des Fleisches und die Frische der Speisen generell. Ich kann den Laden immer nur wieder gerne weiterempfehlen."
Bogazici,Kebab,4,Under ?10,4,4/11/12,"At the beginning I little bit questioning about the taste and the prices. This is my first time to go here, so I do not know the taste at all, and at the first sight the price is above the range of the others same restaurant. But, after I order some foods, the price is worthy compared to the taste. Its delicious. Don't forget after having your main course, try little bit relax and chatty with a cup of tea or coffee and one portion of Baklava. The waiters also very friendly, and they have menu in multi language including English."
Richard,French,4,?21-40,4,11/22/15,"So we came back here the other day for a full eight course menu containing a couple of really nice dishes but most were unfortunately just ok. The service was attentive but the kitchen struggled with the pace because of a fully booked restaurant. It got better during the evening though.I'll most likely return but my high hopes from the first visit has been partly shattered."
Richard,French,4,?21-40,4,10/24/16,"We went there for dinner and opted for the 6 course menu with wine pairing. Portions are very small, even for this type of restaurant, so make sure to go for 5+ courses if you want to get full. Overall we had a good experience, but somehow left wishing for a bit more. The restaurant is very nice, the staff is super friendly but the food could have been more daring. The highlights were some smoked cabbage with an amazing taste and a salmon filet with an amazing sauce. I won't go back there as there are better options in Berlin."
Richard,French,4,?21-40,4,7/4/14,"In one of those happy instances in which you go looking for one place, don't find it, and then find another, Richard was a dining experience that I truly enjoyed, and one that I generally recommend.Small, clean, modern space with some interesting art posted.  Knowledgeable English-speaking staff who will navigate you through the French cuisine that's on a German menu, should you not feel comfortable with either of those languages!My only caveat is that particularly tasteless art (of which there was at least one hanging when I was there some months ago) has no place in such a classy restaurant."
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,8/23/15,"Excellent! The food is expertly prepared. Lovely wine, including the house wine.The staff is friendly & good natured. The atmosphere is very pleasant & in good weather the beer garden is large enough to seat many but not so big that it's too loud for normal conversation. The prices are really very affordable, especially for the scrumptious paella for two... actually enough for two adults & a youngster.Love this place. Great to meet friends & enjoy a relaxing evening eating & laughing together without any stress."
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,10/8/16,Tapas were great. Paella was nice. Prices are very fair and service is super-friendly.
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,2,1/17/15,"Not very impressed.Food was OK, but nothing more. Very spicy. Tried a fish grill plate and an entrec?te. A bit pricey too. Staff was friendly though!"
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,7/13/16,Came here because of friends' recommendations.  Lovely atmosphere. Tapas were delicious! Next time I'll try paella.
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,5,11/4/15,"We had the mussels in white wine, patatas bravas, pimiento de padron, octopus stewed in red sauce, chicken in orange sauce, and salad with goat cheese.Everything was absolutely delicious. The salad with goat cheese was a hit -- they covered the top with honey and thyme and caramelized it, and my friends and I inhaled it. Please go here so I can keep coming back. :)"
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,2,3/18/14,"Decent food, slowest service time I've ever encountered. This is a nice tapas bar, with several vegan options although the menu is only in German and Spanish.The food was decent but took forever to be severed."
Picoteo,Spanish,4.5,?11-20,4,1/24/15,"A little off the beaten path but well worth the trip. As a former resident of Spain, I get nostalgic and need a fix every once and a while. This one hit the spot. Its genuine and the poieple working there are Spanish, so made me feel right at home. I sampled some great pimientos de padron and house wine is quite palatable too! Great for tapas."
Bergmann Curry,Curry Sausage,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/10/17,Best 2 euros spent in Berlin so far! The currywurst is definitely one of the best in town.
Bergmann Curry,Curry Sausage,4.5,Under ?10,3,7/23/16,Came here to try the currywurst over Curry36 since it seemed to have a better rating but it's really all the same. Typical order comes with fries and your choice of sausage/wurst. We came to try it as a snack and there wasn't much wurst compared to the ton of fries they pile on. Curry flavor also wasn't very distinct. We came around 12pm on a weekday and there was no line. It's a small storefront sandwiched between two restaurants with a couple standing tables in front.
Bergmann Curry,Curry Sausage,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/14/17,Best curry around the town (and there are many places)! Worth a try if you're a foreigner.. mmm!
Bergmann Curry,Curry Sausage,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/3/15,"Currywurst isn't always Currywurst. This place is settled between cute coffee shops on Bergmannstr. It is an Imbiss  (standing fast food restaurant). The lady behind the counter was dealing with customers on ger own as her other coworkers did not show up to work on that day. But she managed quite well and remained professional and kind. The sausages taste great, the prices are very reasonable and the choices are goid. We decided on the Knastteller (jail plate), which includes three sausages, curry sauce, additional three choices of sauce, one drink and a big portion of french fries for an amazing price of ?6.66. It definitely doesn't fill three people  (two adults and obe child) but it satisfies the craving for an occasional Currywurst mit Pommes."
Bergmann Curry,Curry Sausage,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/12/14,"We went here on a recent trip to Germany to try currywurst.  It was as fatty and yummy as you would hope it would be... we opted to get it ""mit pelle"" I think that means with skin and added mayo and ketchup, because why not.  I love trying new street foods!"
Sol Y Sombra,Spanish,4,?11-20,5,3/1/09,"Tiny local Spanish with a good variety of tapas and a waitress with an excellent memory (she rarely writes the selection down, but gets it right every time). Specials added to the regular list: wine cheap and good quality. Very busy at weekend and can be difficult to get a table. Food great and portions a good size. Most people opt for tapas here."
Sol Y Sombra,Spanish,4,?11-20,3,8/13/16,"The food was good and the service pretty decent, but nothing really stood out. The Sangria wasn't my favorite though."
G?m??,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,11/29/15,"I had golzleme and chicken soup. I choose the golzleme  with hot pepper and it is very hot! I like it a lot. The soup is also very good."
G?m??,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,6/7/16,"I had a cheese Gozleme with a salad. It was delicous! Reminds me of the food I had in Turkey, yet couldn't find this taste in Europe so far! There is a variety of different baked goods from Turkey. I will definitely come back to try more! Fresh food for small prices (2,50 ? ) Highly recommended."
G?m??,Turkish,5,Under ?10,5,2/23/13,"I always have the g?zleme with spinach & cheese and a chicken soup. The lahmacun, omelettes and ayran are also very tasty here. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. The service is also very nice. I try to go as frequently as possible."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,12/28/17,"It's our favorite Italian restaurant in Berlin.In our last visit it was not the best one but had amazing nights there They have a good wine list and specially if u go for dinner everything tends to be better!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,3,12/29/17,"A fair Italian restaurant with fresh ingredients, well seasoned food located in the shopping area. A worth-to-try for causal lunch or a date. Just need to cook my linguine long enough so it won't taste like a stick inside. Cheers."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,1,7/28/16,"Until today's lunch, I've held this restaurant in high regard. I had a cheese and fig salad as an appetizer and fish as the main. 3 hours later, I felt ill. After an hour of trying to suppress it, my lunch came up with such a force!Still shaking I called the restaurant to warn them (I speak German fluently). They asked my name. I told them then suggested that they check that the fish is fully cooked. Surprisingly, he hung up in my face!If you go there, keep it on the meat side."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,1,9/7/15,"The end of the meal KILLED the entire experience hereAfter they took our dessert orders, they immediately served coffee and cappuccino, but 30 minutes NO dessert still. I asked the waitress where is the dessert and she said it will be right out. I said cancel it and 15 minutes later they came with dessert with another person and i said we cancelled this because after coffee it took too long and they were RUDE!I said to the waitress that it was the fault of the kitchen and not hers in a sweet tone and she was still defensive and rudeTo top it off, the table next to us after a few minutes of ordering their dessert was served theirs. I wonder if it was our dessert?!?!?!!!!!Everything before that was great. Great food, great wine recommendations - BUT they did not handle this well at all!!!!Caveat Emptor!!!!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,1,8/7/16,"Don't get fooled by the beauty of the building ... this place is a scam.Super pricey for low quality food.Seriously... we got some dodgy fried spring onions on top of our meal, felt like shredded plastic bags: impossible to eat.Mozzarella is tiny and tasteless.Presentation is cheap.Decoration is kinda tasteless.You will pay around 100 euros for 2, for a bad Italian meal in a pompous restaurant.You could pay half in some simple trattoria for an amazing meal in a nice atmosphere."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,10/13/13,"Very good Italian restaurant in the heart of Berlin. Decent selection of wines, tasty food and very lively atmosphere, which makes me come back here every time I stay around.Interior is very pleasant, bright colors and my favorite bulbs hanging over the table.Both fish and meet I ate here tastes very delicious. Be sure to save some time and space for dessert.Highly recommended for people wanting to experience Italian pace in Berlin :)"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,1,10/26/15,"We went here today on our day trip to Berlin as we were told it was one of the better Italian spots in Berlin - boy was that an overstatement!After an hour we had still not received our main course (pasta - takes 3 minutes to cook). The manager said he lost our order and would get it right out. 15 minutes later, NOTHING! Upon attempting to talk to our waitress she blew us off multiple times. Still never received our food! Started to walk out and waitress has the audacity to tell us we hadn't paid our check!!! We were there over an hour and a half and never even got our meal .....After leaving we were told they don't like Americans and that's why it happened. Worst service and experience we've had in Germany so far, completely ruined our day trip to Berlin!!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,3,4/14/15,"3.5/5 for me hereWe came in as party of 8 looking for some relief from the heavier German cuisine from the week.  We were recommended this restaurant and fortunately they had room for us, I would suggest making reservations with larger parties.  It is situated on one of the main shopping streets in Berlin so it is easy enough to locate and get to via metro.The ambiance is more upscale dining with an authentic trattoria like twist.  There is a large table in the back that is adjacent to the wine cellar which is nice to see.  The wait staff serving us were all Italians which shows the authenticity of the restaurant sticking to its roots which was nice to see.  They were all friendly and accommodating throughout our dining experience.Getting to the food, we started with an assortment of burrata that was very fresh and excellent, carpaccio of branzino that was very light and good as well, and the octopus that was cooked nice and tender.  For entrees, we tried spaghettini alle vongole that were fresh, gnochettini verde that was colorful and well balanced with tomatoes and ricotta, spaghetti with truffle, and several order of fish fillets.  Everything was prepared with fresh ingredients and offered some nice flavors.  I would recommend the burrata, octopus, and gnochettini if you needed to narrow down your choices.To finish off the meal we also tried several in home-made desserts that were ok.  Nothing really stood out to the group here but always a nice way to end the meal with some sweets and espressos.  After a couple of bottles of wine and taxes/tip, the meal came out to about 45/euro a person which was very reasonable for what we ordered.Buon appetito"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,5,6/22/15,"Whoda thunk there would be such top-notch Italian cuisine in the land of Schnitzel and sauerkraut ?   This place gets it right, particularly with a world class pasta....tagliolini with butter and shaved black truffle.   Definite must as a main course, and do the rigatoni with house made sausage as a starter.  The rest really doesn't matter, since these two will have you ooing and ahhing.  If still hungry, tiramisu is a great finish.  As for wine, they have $100 Brunello (Donna) that goes well with all of it."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,5,2/4/16,This place has tourist trap written all over it so it was quite a surprise when it turned out to be a wonderful and super tasty meal.
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,8/24/14,"Elegant Italian restaurant on Friedrichstrasse.  Attentive service.  The waiters were fairly aggressive in pouring bottled water at E 4 per bottle.  The wine that we wanted was sold out and the waiter showed us alternatives in the same price range.  The fish soup was excellent.  My wife had the special of pasta with shaved truffles.   She found the buttery sauce that it was served in to be too rich, but other patrons were scarfing it down with reckless abandon.  I had a special of quail wrapped in pancetta and stuffed with a mixture of ricotta and pistachios that was very good.  If you want an upscale restaurant in Berlin and are tired of German food, this is a good place."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,3,6/14/15,"It was ok. Burata starter could have been a little creamier and my rigatoni entree seemed over-salted to the point that I didn't finish it. Wasn't worth the high price tag for our party, no one was impressed."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,5,7/13/15,"Excellent food, best veal steak and very very good lamb steak. For Germany or anywhere else it is first class. The service is a bit slow but a well prepared dish is your reward. If you are in the Friederichstrasse area, it should be at the top of anyone's list."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,9/30/12,"I like this place, despite being the film scene every year.... I adore the steaks."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,8/22/14,Very good food and friendly service. The menu is simple not a lot of choices but it's very good very clean environment with a modern look.
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,6/18/13,"Very nice. Lovely ambiance, excellent service, good food. Both elements of the quail with asparagus appetizer were nicely prepared but they didn't quite come together as one dish. The asparagus gratin starter was more successful. Duck with raspberry sauce and rack of lamb entrees were very good, but the black tagliatelle with pesto lacked the expected depth of flavor. In spite of the shortcomings of some individual items, this restaurant is recommended."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,10/23/14,Great meal for group of 8 from 13 to 80 years old. Friendly Efficient service. Food and wine very good
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,4,4/27/13,"Lage! Stilvolles und zugleich gem?tliches Ambiente, leckere Salate, angemessene Preise Die Portionen m?gen teilweise etwas klein sein, aber daf?r stimmt die Qualit?t. Man kann ?ber das Bocca di Bacco sagen, was man will, aber der Service ist erstklassig. Einem wird der Mantel an der T?r abgenommen, man wird zum Tisch gef?hrt und der Ober kommt in regelm??igen Abst?nden vorbei, um nach der Zufriedenheit zu fragen und Bestellungen aufzunehmen."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,5,9/12/13,"Just excellent. Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in Berlin. The food is gorgious (try the sword fish for the main dish, absolutely fabulous, not to mention the tira-mi-su). Extensive wine list, very fair prices. Friendly service, reservation required, the place is packed practically all the time. Highly recommended!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4,?21-40,3,9/2/09,"Bocca di Bacco is a really nice trendy Italian restaurant serving nice meals but in a high price category. The prices you pay here you would expect to pay for a fabulous a la carte restaurant else where. The price tag does effect if you are in a tourist area or not and this restaurant is., it is situated in Berlin Mitte close to many tourist hotels. The food was ok, nothing really breathtaking that's if you are use to good food, but it does look and taste good but it is more of a trendy Italian style of cooking rather than basic Italian cooking. I would advise to reserve a table; we didn't when we arrived there so we had to wait for around 30 minutes in there seating area and had drinks while we waited. The staff are really pleasant and professional, they know their jobs and they know how to perform. We had a good waiter and even though he was rushed off his feet, he was never to busy to ask the guests if they are enjoying the meal, really attentive. A good wine is really pricey here, we paid 85 Euros for a standard red wine full of body, but it was really good, therefore worth what we paid for it. This is a place where you would have business meetings, spend the evening with family or friends, not really a romantic thing as it is quite busy and very large therefore not very suttle as guests and staff are rushing by. It a place if you want a quick meal close to your hotel"
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,5,1/10/18,"My favorite place in Berlin.  A charming, cozy corner, neighborhood place, where the food never disappoints.  Gets crowded at mealtimes, but I really like coming in off-hours for wine, or cake or amazing desserts.  A Bergmankiez landmark not to be missed."
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,3,5/17/17,"YUM! We ended up getting two types of crepes: smoked salmon and the ham and cheese. The crepes were so good. We were a bit thrown off by how thick the crepes were but aside from that, they were amazing. We each had half of each other's which was nice. If you have wheat allergies etc, maybe this isn't the best dish due to the thickness of the crepes. We also ended up getting the banana nutella dessert crepe. It was so good. The coffee was also really tasty. The reason it's 3 stars is due to how slow the food takes to come out. We waited well over 30 minutes for crepes. I'm sorry but unless it's some extremely complicated menu item, I don't think crepes (we all ordered crepes) should take that long. We actually had to ask because we thought they forgot our food order but they said it was just taking awhile. We ordered our dessert crepe not even halfway through our savory crepes because we anticipated the wait. Even when we were done and had our 2nd orders of coffee...we were still waiting for our dessert crepe. If the food didn't take so long, it'd get 5 stars. But the wait was just so absurd I knocked it down two. Aside from the wait, we were very happy with our meal and the beverages. I'd happily come here again. The food took so long I couldn't justify even doing 4 stars.The place is really cute. There's indoor and outdoor seating. The space resembles a pub with a counter when you walk in and then more space inside to the left with many tables to choose from."
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,4,2/26/12,"This place serves excellent Italian fare. It has its charm and is a place where one can have a long meal with friends and chat the night away. Their service is quite top notch for a little local restaurant in Germany. Personally, I have rarely received good service from any restaurant here, especially in Berlin.The wait staff was very attentive and actually took care of our table, came around with multiple utensils and extras, without us having to ask for new cutlery (which I find is absolutely ridiculous in some restaurants where you are having a few courses). Anyways, I was impressed by their attentiveness. The olive oil tasted like the authentic stuff. You know, from the lady across the town in that little corner store, who hoards the flavorful variety. Also nice to note is the FRESH ground pepper. It really makes a difference folks. Combined with the good olive oil, the bread was yummilicious.Their pasta is delicious and really rich. I forget what I had, but it was the one with pine nuts, raisins, swiss chard, and penne pasta, covered in a cream sauce. It was the perfect serving size after sharing some appetizers.Our table had a bottle of Chianti, a few bottles of water, about 3 beers, 4 cocktails, the classic appetizer dish, and three main courses and the total bill came out to around 80 euros, which I think is ridiculously cheap considering our happy and full bellies, the great conversation, the nice atmosphere, and our slightly buzzed mood. We were fully prepared to conquer our next mission: operation dance dance dance. Definitely will be coming back here again. I am not giving the place 5 stars because although the food is pretty good, I still have had better Italian food in Berlin. Also, looking at other tables, the pizza didn't look so appetizing."
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,3,5/7/12,"The best thing about 'Molinari and Ko' is that there is a seated area where you can (if you get there early enough) sit and enjoy the summer afternoon/evening and your meal and drinks outside. Breakfast and coffee is enjoyed by many in the summer and I have had that pleasure at least twice. I can't say I was really blown away by it though. To me it was standard Berlin breakfast fare with nothing to make it stand out from the crowd but it was by no means bad either! Evening meals are a mixed bag, pasta meals are not bad but their Pizzas are not as good as one might hope. I love Pizza and so was dissapointed by what I got. I do enjoy a wee beer here now and again in the summer though and it's a big favourite with a few of my friends."
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,3,10/29/13,Mama hoho. nothing special. nice place but boring food and not very inspiring menu. Don?t go for dinner. More of a breakfast palce
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,4,11/14/10,"(sorry, dass ich auf englisch schreibe, anstatt deutsch - ich kann eine genauere ?berpr?fung schreiben diese weise!)molinari+ko. is a cozy little italian caf? just off the (often annoying) bustle of Bergmannstrasse.  i've never been for dinner, but it is one of my favorite places for breakfast on this side of Kreuzberg. great coffee, fantastic+sinful cakes, and a nice array of breakfasts, from eier im glas with sheep's cheese+tomatoes to scrambled eggs to mixed breakfasts. inside, there's a bit of a rustic feel with dark wood benches and tables but, if it's a sunny day, try to grab a seat outside to people-watch.  the service is friendly and fast, even outside (although sometimes it helps to let them know you're there if you pop inside to grab a menu). makes for a great way to start a weekend morning!"
Molinari & Ko,Italian,4,?11-20,4,10/27/08,"Very friendly staff. I had a pizza and a glass of not to bad house wine the evening I arrived in Berlin and I must say. Great pizza, nice staff, good wine for a reasonable price and a very authentic (whatever that means ;-)) atmosphere. Good breakfast to!"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/8/18,"My wife says that this is one of the best Schnitzels she has had in Berlin.  I ordered the Swiss Schnitzel and she ordered a plain one.  Both came with fries and a small salad.We would certainly recommend this place and we will be back again!  It is worth checking out if you are looking for a good Schnitzel!"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,11/23/17,"Nicely tucked away in corner - great for a quiet evening. Ordered the Schnitzel Hunter style and flying kangaroo - both are amazing.Great ambience and very affordable."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,11/7/17,"I had a pretty good experience at Elefant. After finding this place (due to Yelp reviews) I had no trouble getting seated or waited upon. Actually the place was fairly empty, maybe as it was a Tuesday night at 9 pm. However, the service was fast and friendly - nothing like some of the negative reviews I've read. My waiter was quick to seat me where I wanted and to take my order. Food service was fast - perhaps due to the slow evening, but I can't be sure. I had J?gerschnitzel (I think Hunter's schnitzel on the English menu). It came out hot and tasty, with a great mushroom gravy (per the particular dish). Sides included some fried  potato things (short, fried prepared looking potatoes) and a small salad. The schnitzel really satisfied; just what I wanted from a German restaurant.  There were MANY schnitzel options, so if you are craving schnitzel this may be a good spot to land. I'd like to return and try some more. The only downer for me was a lack of ambiance. It resembles a sports bar to me. Some cheesy lighting and elephant decor. To me the setting doesn't match, but it didn't really bother me."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,12/20/17,"This is such a wonderful location. Such nice restaurant and decorated very neat. The food is just Delicious and also good selection also smal portions and for vegetarians. Just loved the music so unique. The staff was really nice to! Would definitely go back there again :)"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,7/15/17,"Really great little spot in downtown Berlin for a quick authentic German lunch. Most of us went with the schnitzel (so good), but also the liver was amazing and these guys don't skimp on a very large cheese plate. Tomato soup was also really good.But, highlight was the schnitzel. Pork - or veal if you choose - and ample portions with a about 15 varieties to choose from.Really great service and also a variety of beverages and great German beers.Seemed like a friendly spot and would definitely come back."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,10/31/17,"Had the schnitzel with bernaise sauce - it was huge !  The meat was very tender.  And while the server wasn't very friendly, I attribute that to a language barrier.  But it was pretty good food."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,5/28/17,Big portions and friendly staff! Great place to eat schnitzel! I recommend to anyone hungry in Berlin and craving some German food.
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/18/17,"My fam bam and I recently visited Berlin and searched Yelp for GERMAN FOOD... cuz when in Germany....The closest and highest rated hit was Elefant.The servers were very patient with my crazy family and suggested the pork knuckle which was AWESOME! My pal got what he referred to as the best schnitzel he tasted in Eastern Europe. There was definitely a bit of a language barrier but the menu was in English and my family applauded my Yelp pick! On a side note that matters very little to me but probably won't be the right choice for some crazy bible thumping religious zealot (take your neggie vibes elsewhere please) visiting Berlin: I'm not sure if it's located in a gay district or happens to be a cluster of gay friendly businesses but yeah, it's a an amazing restaurant run by gay dudes with awesome food and nice people. Nuff said."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,2,11/11/17,"Was really excited to get some Weinerschnitzle, like I've had 100s of times but better, but this was not that. The meat was half-assed pounded, poor darker meat cut, the breeding sloughing off the finished product and burnt underneath. Waiter was ok, decent English, expected a tip though wasn't that attentive. Waste of time and money."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,3,8/29/17,"The food here is basic and pretty good. The place has a sleek and modern look. The staff is pleasant. English menu, with many different kinds of schnitzel, which might be a little gimmicky, but I don't think you can go wrong if you order their special thing. We went during off hours, and it was empty. I would recommend doing that for any popular restaurant in Berlin. It's annoying when people complain, about any place, that the place was packed and they got stiffed a little by slow service."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,9/3/17,"Awesome food - schnitzel selections that make choosing difficult. Loved the food, the service, the friendly waitstaff and owners. Love a place where the people are happy to work there and the food shows it. I had the schnitzel with horseradish and my partner had the schnitzel bearnaise mit pomme frite. Cooked to perfection. Strudel (and a couple of Jaegermeisters) put the bow on an awesome evening."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,10/22/17,Great service!! First time in Berlin from California. Loved the schnitzel - so many different preparations of it! Yummy apple strudel and baileys Irish coffee.
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/5/17,"Their specialty is schnitzel, but they have some other choices as well. The appetizer bread with what tasted like a potato salad spread was a great start. Service was super friendly despite our waiter not speaking very good English. Highly recommended!"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,6/20/17,"My buddy and I ended up at Elefant after a few hours of walking around Berlin, late one Friday night, looking for a place to eat. Everywhere was booked up, even Elefant, too! But, when we walked in, they offered us seating outside and we happily accepted. There were even some blankets out (as it was early April, and quite chilly). The gentleman helping us was clearly bogged down inside with tables, but still managed to run outside and take care of us, without seeming impatient or rude. He spoke english and made it very easy for us to enjoy the dinner. If I remember correctly, I think they had an english menu too. Even though it took a little while for the food to come out, and we were starving, neither of us could finish our dishes. They were both delicious and decadent and just amazing. It was sort of by happenstance that we ended up coming here, but I'm really happy we did!"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,3,3/19/17,"I was craving Schnitzel and German Goulash. Found this restaurant near me and decided to give it a try. I tried the goulash hear, it was enjoyable and that's why I have it the three stars, but I don't believe it to be the best I've tried in my visit to Berlin. The service was ok, the atmosphere during lunch time was dead, we were the only ones. Don't regret going, but wouldn't go again unless it's to try the schnitzel that is supposedly their speciality."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/3/17,"The atmosphere was open, friendly, and entertaining. A joy to be there.....and then there was the food. An almost mind blowing variety of schnitzel and it was ""sehr lecker"" (very delicious). All around, a wonderful place and I would head back if I were in town."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,10/27/17,Excellent food and excellent service.  We came here twice and enjoyed both times.  I'm almost sad we are leaving soon and couldn't have eaten here more.  Chris was our server both times and was informative and professional.  Cheers.
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,4,8/3/17,"We went for lunch because the night before we didn't want to wait an hour to eat as it was already 9 o'clock.  Luckily, there were plenty of tables in the afternoon.  The waiter was friendly and patient.  We had the goulash soup, the cheese plate and the beef roulade.  We were given a complimentary bread and dip before all the aforementioned were served.  Everything was great, I did enjoy the roulade although it may have been a tad dry, but the potato dumplings and cabbage were great.  We would've liked to have tried the apple stroudel with ice cream, but we just didn't have room for it.  Had to take much of the cheese plate to go.  I loved the cheese plate, it's enough for four people.  Reasonable prices with nice outdoor seating if you can get it."
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,1/25/17,"Awesome restaurant right down the street from our hotel! Found some good reviews on yelp and decided to give it a shot and WOW! So glad we did:) first time trying schnitzel and it was sooooooo great! I started with a few beers, potato soup and the Swiss style schnitzel and my girl got some prosecco, onion soup and the Hawaii schnitzel and it was all to die for!!! So much food for a reasonable price! 48 euro for all of this! We left extremely happy and would be delighted to stop in again if passing by!"
Elefant,German,4.5,?11-20,5,5/4/17,Though I'm not the biggest fan of German food I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes we got. I got the pork loins with onion and mashed potatoes and my sister got the breakfast plate shnitzel (wolstein). The pork was juicy and flavorful and the mashed potatoes were fluffy. The breakfast plate is amazing if you love shnitzel.
Chalet Suisse,French,3.5,?21-40,5,2/2/15,"This is just an amazing restaurant!In the middle of the forest, Grunewald, in Berlin so you really feel like being on short ''vacation''.You can relax and forget the daily stress.I went there on a weekend with my family. Better to reserve a table since it was very full.Very nice and special atmosphere with a fireplace inside. Nice service that knows a lot about chosing the right wine, too.The menue is not too long having seasonal fresh food. I chose fish..Great!I will definitely come back. In summer they open the beergarden with Neuland meat from the grill.Definitely recommendable!"
Chalet Suisse,French,3.5,?21-40,5,7/8/17,We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon with our puppy at the dog beach and found the delightful chalet Suisse on our way out. So thankful we checked to see if we could find vegetarian food and a spot for puppy as well. Yummy gazpacho and delicious lentil salad. Fantastic service and food. : )
Chalet Suisse,French,3.5,?21-40,4,5/27/15,So delightful. A total charmer in the forest with surprisingly great food and a charming space with fireplace and big terrace out front. Exactly the spot I wanted to find in the Grunewald.
Chalet Suisse,French,3.5,?21-40,1,8/4/15,"Saturday early evening, great weather so a visit in the nearby Biergarten Chalet Suisse seamed to be a good ideaUnfortunately we left disappointed and with the feeling we will not return here so soonThe Biergarten was almost empty that should have told us don't stay and eat.When we placed our order at the self service counter half on the displayed options weren't available so we choose 2 half chicken and potato salad. The food you also had to pick up yourself even though only 3 tables where occupied the person prepare the food we will not call him a chef jealed the number that was given with the receipt through the Biergarten, did not help to make the atmosphere better. I should have left it at the counter but we were all hungry. It did not  look very promising and I asked is it really came from the grill, the answer was yes but it surely wasn't.It was tasteless and the worth was the all wabbely skin. Please send your staff somewhere for training.Pitty really as the location could be great."
Chalet Suisse,French,3.5,?21-40,5,8/2/15,"Been here a couple times for drinks and lunch. Great service and fantastic food. The outdoor patio area is gorgeous, great atmosphere"
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,9/30/17,"After German meals, it was a delight to find an authentic French restaurant in Berlin. The interior has a little bit of character, the servers were very friendly and helpful. The wine selection was surprisingly slim, but the red we had was excellent. We loved our appetizers, mains and desserts starting with froi gras, escargot and grilled octopus. The steak and duck were good, although the duck could have been better. The chocolate lava cake and Xtreme br?l?e were excellent. If I lived in Berlin, I would come back frequently!"
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,3,8/15/17,"The service is very slow.  I've been in Europe for 5 weeks and each restaurant makes you feel like a guest who can stay all night, but brings delicious food promptly.  Here, you will wait all night for your food.  The mini quiche was quite good, the escargot was drowned in butter.  I'd tell you how the entrec?te is, but I'm still waiting for it..."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,8/3/17,"Went their twice. First time the Ratatouille with Potato Gratin was great. Second time I ordered the Entrecote with Fries and was equally satisfied. To top it off the service is incredibly friendly and fast. A bit pricy, but definitely worth it."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,12/17/15,"I kidnapped my companion here for dinner tonight; told him to show up at the nearby metro station without telling him where we were going. Since I haven't been here, I was hoping that they would be a good experience. So far, I can say that we had a great time.We opted to stay within the first courses, ordering three first course dishes as a three-course meal instead of doing a first course and a main dish. I started with the snails. They were tasty, but I wasn't too impressed. That being said, I haven't had snails which I liked, so maybe I have something against the animal instead of against the way it was prepared tonight.I followed that with the salmon tartare. That was great! I loved the mixture of the salad which was light, with the salmon, which just had the right amount of flavor. My third dish was the foie gras, which definitely was a killer.We asked for recommendations for the wine, and while it was slightly confusing, as the first recommendation we got was actually for a wine that doesn't exist anymore, the wine we ended up selecting was still a great match.The reason why I am not giving this place a full score is because of the service. Maybe they were understaffed, and maybe there was just too many people who had a reservation on the time we had ours, but service could improve. Things were a little slow to be delivered, and the wine recommendation could improve. It also would have been nice if they replaced the silverware with every dish they delivered. That being said, the food was great and more than compensated for it. I know of other better French brasseries in Berlin, but if someone would ask, I would still come back here for the food."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,10/7/16,Excellent Bistro right in Mitte. Nice discovery in a sea of heavy German food. Great steaks and perfect chocolate fondant! Great service adorable young frenchies with a great wine list by the glass. Superb!
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,5/20/16,"It was late and I was hungry and tired of German food so I decided to try this place out.  Wow truly excellent meal.  I had three starters and a glass of Bordeaux , the house wine.  A balsamic salad with warm goat cheese on toast.....excellent!  Escargot, you either like it or not.  For those that do these were great not just a garlic butter that overpowers everything but with interesting spices. And a homemade duck pate, also very  tasty.  Maybe I've been away too long but I would almost come back to Berlin just to eat there again. Service great, small so not too loud. A classic and superb brasserie.  Just go!"
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,4/2/17,Had a perfect dinner at the brasserie! Employees are really sweet and friendly. Although the place is quite small it's quite comfy and cozy. Last but not least - delicious food ! Thank you
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,3/9/16,"Lovely French brasserie featuring the classics like steak frites, escargot, mussels, etc. Everything was very tasty, service is usually nice. Daily menus with lots of diversity, plenty of fish options. Have eaten here on normal nights and NYE with a special menu a few years ago. Almost always a great experience.One negative experience -- one item on the German menu listed the sauces as included in the price of a steak dish, while the English menu listed the sauces as a couple euros extra. I didn't notice until after I ordered since the waitress had simply asked which sauce I wanted (not noting it was an extra charge). The table next to us got their bill first and identified the issue when the server put the extra charge for the sauce on their bill. They, like us, had ordered from the German menu but mainly talked amongst themselves in English, and thought the fact they were being charged an ""English menu price"" even though they ordered from a different menu made it feel like the restaurant was intentionally charging non-Germans more. Not much sympathy for them or us from the waitress, who said it was a typo and the restaurant would go with the higher charge. Seems like you should pay the price you saw on the menu you ordered from, but oh well, it was only a couple euros extra, so even though it was one instance of unfortunate customer service, not ready to write off the whole restaurant."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,11/14/15,"Service could have been a bit more attentive, but food was fantastic. We ordered the goat cheese salad and steak frites. The steak frites came in a very large size, so totally shareable between 2 people. We ordered the molten chocolate cake which was deliciously decadent, and it came with a scoop of pistachio gelato- superb. Wine list is also fab."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,10/29/14,"Great food and service. A home run for ambience, service and food. Started with oysters followed by fantastic pumpkin soup with toasted pumpkin seeds. Silky smooth with great flavor. Warm goat cheese and toast with salad. Light  dressing was delightful. Main courses were risotto with zucchini and lemon zest. Just the right amount of  spring to the rice. Lamb loin was nicely prepared with lovely jus. A great experience."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,3/27/16,"We had a brilliant meal here.  Well-prepared rib eye with chips and salad topped by a lovely and generous chocolate mousse.  Friendly staff and nice dark atmosphere, who were comfortable seating two walk-ins with no warning on a Saturday night."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,4/7/14,"It?s french, it?s cosy and the food is great.   I have been here several times and I was never disappointed.  My favorite dish is the tartar de boeuf with french fries but all the other plates are just as delicious.   And don?t forget to try their desserts, the creme br?l?e and the moelleux au chocolate are just to die for! Good for a small group of friends or for a romantic en amoureux!"
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,1/25/14,"Pas mas de tout, nice bistro food, sehr lecker"
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,3/2/13,Not sure how it comes that nobody has reviewed this place yet. It is a really great find. They serve soma amazing French food in a very nice and relaxed setting. Staff is friendly and prices are very reasonable. They also do a great lunch menu. You have to reserve in advance though as the place is always full. Try to reserve as soon as possible to not be disappointed.
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,5/16/13,Amazing food and friendly stuff. Great place. Will definitely come back.
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,5/26/11,"I referred to the qype comments and drove from Hannover. I say, service and atmosphere was just right. Not the high-class pretending ones. Feels like home anybody? And the food... I would drive 2.5 hrs just to have dinner again."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,5/13/13,"Great food, great service. Price at dinner time ranged from EUR16-22."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,4,3/11/13,"a good French restaurant in Mitte. Ambiance was quite good, the bill though- far more expensive than I had thought it would be. The duck confit was splendid, but I was a bit sad to see the dessert I ordered (creme brulee) wasn't up to par with what I had in Paris. Too high hopes, I suppose? I give in honesty 3.75 but will go with the four because it had a wonderful atmosphere. Would go back but wouldn't rush to."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,7/4/12,"Simply delicious and fabulous value, particularly at midday. We opted for the entrecote with frites and foil-baked halibut, preceded by pork terrine. Everything was absolutely top-notch  from the ingredients to preparation through to the relaxed atmosphere and attentive, friendly service. Would go back in an instant."
Brasserie La Bonne Franquette,French,4.5,?21-40,5,8/6/10,"Very nice and friendly french place, very good quality of food and friendly staff! A little bit hidden in Chausseestr. but you will recognize it by the french flag which is outside."
Osmanya,Turkish,4,?21-40,5,4/23/14,"We ate here one night on a recent stay in Berlin, as it was close to our apartment. The place was quite quiet, with less than half the tables full, so we could choose any table we wanted. We sat outside, with those lovely fleecy throws that everyone in Berlin seems to use (a GREAT idea, by the way - can we make this catch on in other places too please?).The restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere, with some quiet music and everyone talking amongst themselves. The waitress who greeted us was helpful and attentive and spoke excellent English. Overall, it looked very nice and we decided it was as good a place as any, so we gave it a shot.And then the food arrived! Oh my, but it was tasty!! All six of us went quiet for quite a long time as we devoured everything on our plates. It was all so fresh and tasty, and just...just lovely. Above all else, it was the meat that did it: cooked to absolute perfection - so much so that it makes my mouth water thinking about it even now..."
Osmanya,Turkish,4,?21-40,5,2/21/16,"I was told that when In Berlin, try ethnic foods instead of German cuisine. Osmanya was recommended by a Berliner of Turkish background. It was a good tip. It's out of the main tourist areas, and at least half of the diners seemed to be Turkish--an indication that it would be authentic. It was. The stuffed grape leaves, the eggplant and Loop de Mer baked in grape leaves were all delicious. So was the Turkish Sauvignon Blanc. This is a very elegant neighborhood  restaurant. It's worth a visit."
Osmanya,Turkish,4,?21-40,5,2/27/16,"Fantastic food and great service. The best food I had in the whole week long stay in Berlin. Great appetizers and amazing kababs. The Kanafe dessert was also a tad bit better than the one we get back home at Dish Dash in Sunnyvale/Milpitas, California."
Osmanya,Turkish,4,?21-40,4,7/10/13,"Great Turkish food.nice atmosphere, and fine for children"
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,7/24/15,"Great food! Really nice staff, the waitress gave my boyfriend and I free fortified wine at the end.One thing- yelp says it is 4 euro signs when it is SO CHEAP! Like, 5 euros for an entree and a side cheap. Please change this yelp!"
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,7/24/15,"This is the place for good Chinese food at low prices. They even gave us the lunch special price at dinnertime, and complimentary after-dinner drinks. Knocked my socks off. I would say to you: go for it. Go. Tasty stuff."
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,5,9/14/15,"As Lollapalooza Berlin was coming to a close, we had an impromptu dance party with a Korean food vendor and its staff. I asked their owner where to go for a unique meal in Berlin and was sent to Pacifico.This restaurant had just opened a week prior, but was already enjoying a fair bit of traffic when I came in on a rainy Monday afternoon. This place does Asian fusion, serving burgers, tacos, and bowls. After chatting with the staff, I decided on the Kimcheezy Burger for 6.30 euro.A few minutes later, I was devouring my delicious burger. The meat was the star here, perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. I got through the whole thing before I realized there was no egg on the burger as promised.I ended up chatting with the owner for a bit, and he felt bad about the missing egg and gave me some kimchi fries as an apology. Completely unnecessary, but I was not unhappy to try another menu item. They were great!It seems like Pacifico has a winning formula with great food and great staff, and I'll definitely be stopping by next month when I return to Berlin."
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,5,5/13/17,Pacifico is my go to place! The service is super cool and nice and the food is great too! I definitely recommend it!! :)
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,1,4/26/17,Waited long time till someone takes order.. nobody cared.. Apfelschorle overpriced (2.80? for 0.33l .. wtf) .. burgers cooked till they are completely dead.. so just ok.. but still too expensive for quality..  mehr Schein als sein..
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,1,9/9/16,"Food took too long to arrive, my order was messed up, and the substitute never came. Server simply said 'ok' when I politely complained. Atleast I had my money back for the missing item. Oh, and the take on 'Korean Street Food' that I did get to taste was boring with too few condiments and too little flavour."
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,5,3/31/16,"Where to begin, the kimchi fries order them nothing else matters. I had the taco's too but I was so captivated with my friends food that I didn't want my own. Great location, didn't have to wait long at all. The price was worth it and honestly I would have paid more."
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,2,11/19/16,The food wasn't great and wasn't cheap. My bowl was 10 euro for Seoul bowl with pork. The veggies and sauce weren't that flavorful and the meat tough and dry. Also what was flavorful was too salty. Although there's not much Asian food in the area I'd avoid this
Pacifico,Burgers,3.5,Under ?10,5,12/14/15,"Heaven in your mouth. Kimchi fries was one of the most suprising food I experienced this year. Burger was delicious. Perfect bun, well cooked meat, well finished sauce and fresh and tasteful vegetables. Also it made me happy to find out they offer Pilsner Urquell (bottle). I can only recommend it and hope I will come back soon."
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/19/17,"An almost unrecognizable ""hole-in-the-wall"" restaurant, yet serves the most authentic Chinese food in Berlin with dishes from many regions in China including Ningxia.Try the Grilled Lamb Skewers, the noodle soups, and the Szechuan Beef"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,6/26/16,"Tasty and affordable, though they don't seem to be doing the tabletop bbq anymore, even though it's still on the menu (or maybe that was a temporary thing?). Lots of more authentic dishes to separate the menu from the traditional panAsian stir fries made for German palettes. Would definitely recommend the northern Chinese dishes. Skip the dumplings though.Inside of the restaurant is a little plain. Can be stuffy on hot days. Nice service though."
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,3/29/16,"This is the first place I've eaten at in Berlin that reminds me of the food back home. I am from San Gabriel Valley in the Los Angeles area where it is easy to find authentic Chinese food so I can say I know my Asian food really well. All the flavors are there. They make their food fresh everyday. The owners and servers are very nice and friendly. And if you want to try something unique, I strongly recommend their red wine pear dish which is cool, crisp, and sweet. They also hand make their noodles and have different dumpling skins that gets its color from vegetable juice. Try this place!"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/13/15,"Nice dishes, nice services, the dumplings and noodles are very delicious and really 'chinese style'."
BiBim,Korean,4,?11-20,5,3/28/16,"This has been the second time we went to BiBim. Most probably not the last time ;o) A nice and cozy Korean restaurant. I would recommend to reserve a table just to be on the safe side! Oh, and no card payments, so you better bring cash! Menus are available in German and English language.Starters are good, we found the zucchini pancakes better than the kimchi ones (not really spicy). The glad noodle salad is always a choice as a starter (also as a not vegetarian...).All together: Staff is friendly, service and food good!"
BiBim,Korean,4,?11-20,4,7/15/16,"I love Korean food (I cook it myself). When I'm lazy, I eat it in restaurants. This restaurant has me more convinced than other Korean restaurants in Berlin. The food is most definitely made with care - it is fresh, flavourful and has a good level of spice; and I'm pretty sure they use actual Gochujang/garu and soy sauce (unlike some other places I've eaten in Berlin). The prices are comparable to any other dinner restaurant - they are not a lunch spot - they serve dinner and give you somewhat of an exclusive experience, but not too over-the-top. The atmosphere and interiors are nice. They offer a nice variety of dishes (including vegan options). The portion sizes are healthy and good enough for someone ready for dinner :) They have a lovely selection of wine, including traditional Korean plum wine! The service is very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. They even made a vegan Gimbap for me upon request :) Note: My reviews are based on local comparisons - for instance when I review a place in Berlin, I am only comparing it to other places in Berlin, not to places in London or New York."
BiBim,Korean,4,?11-20,4,8/9/13,"Bibim, a hidden gem off the beaten track!The zucchini pancake is very thin and tasty. Octopus with zucchini, chili and garlic: what a combination.The kimchi is very good!It' s worth going there early (7 pm) so that the only one waitress doesn't let you wait too long.Apart from the fact that you might have to wait a bit longer during rush hour service is very attentive and polite."
BiBim,Korean,4,?11-20,5,10/23/10,Good Korean food. I liked it better than YamYam. Run by a really nice family. A welcome new addition to the 'hood.
BiBim,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/6/11,Dont understand why this place is empty most of the time. The food is fantasticThey are just a little bit shy on the meatjust a bit more and its perfect..
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/18/15,"I'd never tried Korean food before, but Mmaah was round the corner from where I was staying and caught my interest when I passed.I had the Mandu Veggie meal, small portion, for ?4.50. 3 large dumplings filled with a delicious minced vegetable mixture served with a sesame sauce, rice and a crisp salad. The meal was very tasty, light and fresh and much bigger than I had expected for the 'klein' portion size.There's some enclosed seating at the counter and some tables and chairs outside, or you can have your order in a takeaway box to go."
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/5/16,came here with my uncle a while back. it's a great option before or after the park. food is tasty. price is ok. not sure if they are catering to german tastes or what but didn't really seem to korean tasting.. though was still a nice experience and we both really enjoyed it a lot. both my uncle (who wasn't too much of a korean food fan and was kind of just humoring his banchan obsessed niece) were really happy with the meal. its a cute space also!
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/15/15,"Tiny Korean BBQ booth just around the corner from Tempelhofer Feld, tasty, good value, clean and stylish. Looking forward to trying the vegetarian offers"
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/27/14,"Popular spot along Tempelhof, Hotgogi Potatoes were nice, the bulgogi was well seasoned (a little on the sweeter side) with some sauces over potatoes (delicious). The middle portion is quite large (though I did finish it all). There was quite a queue of people here (testament to its popularity) which can mean a bit of a wait, friendly guy working behind the counter, great for a before/after park snack!"
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/22/16,Great fast-casual stand near Hasenheide park. Great to bike or walk by and get a bite. Was actually spicy which I appreciate in a place like Berlin. Super friendly lady and a couple of bar tables outside. Kind of a gem in the area.
Mmaah,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/6/14,Better than all the other similar priced restaurants in the area. Nice to have a decent asian near schillerkiez finally. Both the chicken and beef lived up to expectations.
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,2/12/16,"Run by the sweetest Korean couple, who let me wait inside for nearly half an hour while my group arrived.I'd never liked kimchi (I've actually always actively disliked it) until this meal, so that's saying something.Had just eaten before and so was too full to try the bibimbap, but all three of the other people ordered and loved it. Got the gimbap instead, was very happy with my choices."
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,10/13/17,"Adorable little Mom and Pop spot! The atmosphere is cozy and chic, totally down to earth! The food was simple and delicious ! Can't go wrong with the kimchee jigae!! Being Korean/German I totally got a kick out of this place! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,12/21/16,Could be Berlin's best and rather underhyped Korean restaurant. You must try the bibimbap served on a hot stone!
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,3/9/16,Decent korean food with a wide variety and also a very nice setting/atmosphere. Very reasonably priced :) i got the tofu soup and my friend got the bibimbap. Both of us loved our dishes
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,2/25/15,"Usually about Asian restaurant Its Hard to imagine what good atomoshe. But when I came here first I can feel pretty cozy and nice interior. I had pork bokkum and two kind of kimbab! I think vegetable kimbab is the best xD in the kimbabs. Deggiebokkum is too sweet to me but also good. The price is very right and the staff is very kind. But kimchi isn't the authentic taste or special,I don't think the kimchi home made."
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/5/15,"This place is pretty good. When you walk inside, it has very modern and simple decor, which was a nice touch. All of the food was good and pretty authentic tasting (some flavors were westernized a little bit). We ordered meat and vegetable fried dumplings, haemuldoenjangjigae, yukgaejang and bulgogi. They all came with panchan (side dishes) and all tasted very nice although not 100% Korean flavors (more like 80%). I will go back!"
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,8/16/14,"I Loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious! Korean pancakes with vegetables, GREAT. Bibimbap, GREAT! I had glas noodles with beef and vegetables, also GREAT! Everything had good taste! And the service was super friendly and since friends and family of the owner was there it all had a very home familiar like feeling to it. Great night!"
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,9/30/16,"Amazing Bibimbap! Haven't tested many different ones in Berlin, but this was definitely up there"
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,6/14/12,"Das Essen ist gut und die koreanische Ajumma freundlich. Es ist ein ziemlich kleines Restaurant, wo man mit den anderen unbekannten G?sten fast nebeneinander sitzt. Lediglich die Einrichtung der Teller k?nnte ein bisschen mehr an Korea erinnern  zu westlich f?r mich. Werde wieder vorbeischauen, wenn ich in Charlottenburg bin und Lust auf koreanisches Essen habe."
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/21/14,"I wanted Korean food today and found a review online talking about Cooking Papa, so I tried it. I had the bulgogi which was very flavourful, not sweet (as I have had in other Berlin Korean restaurants), the beef was super tender. It came with rice and three side dishes. The kimchi was great, spicy and garlicy and just great, the potatoes were nice but didn't have much flavour and the radish was good. I look forward to trying more there. I paid 8? which seems to be a good deal these days. I also had an interesting cinnamon-ginger drink which was excellent but too sweet. I'd love to have it with half the sugar but they just order from some place ;)"
Cooking Papa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,11/25/11,"simple, tasty traditional korean food reasonably priced, speedy service from friendly hostess-waitress seems to be a family-run place quiet atmosphere"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,12/30/17,"For my Taiwanese tongue this is one of the best if not THE best Chinese Restaurant I have tried in Berlin. The food is so great and authentic I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Chinese food. The food can be a bit spicy, but I guess you can always ask them to make it less spicy in case you are not used to it. ;)"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/10/17,"Prima!! One of the best Chinese restaurants in Berlin!The waitresses were very nice too.We loved it!"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,2/11/16,"More like 3.5 stars but I think this place is a pretty decent chinese restaurant with great service and nice ambienceThe place is smaller than I thought and there might be a bit of a wait if you go there during peak hours. Food was decent. The spicy chicken was a bit too small with too many peppers and not so much chicken yet the Portion is generous. The ??? was weird. Not really like what I have in china or the US. Mapo tofu was on point but lacks wow factorsuper friendly service and Free rice/tap water :)-1 stars for not honoring yelp offer and for having a lot of promos/campaigns yet servers seem to know nothing about those and the campaigns themselves are ambiguous"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,2/11/16,"Although I'm Vietnamese, I lived in Beijing this past summer and had a decent share of Chinese food. Disclaimer: I've never been that fond of it.I've had better. That being said, this place was still good and reasonably priced. Vegetarian options available, service is friendly, and they speak Mandarin. And if it matters to you, many if not most customers were Chinese.I did dock a star for not explaining/acknowledging the check-in offer."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,1/17/17,"Disappointing food for rather high prices. The atmosphere is dingy with the distinct lingering smell of bathroom, which already made me lose my appetite. The food was overall quite greasy, which is a character of bad Chinese food. The Szechuan fish we ordered tasted like old frozen fish, very stale and slimy in texture. Overall sanitation of the space was turnoff to my wanting to eat anything there. Would not recommend especially given the price of usually 20-35 a person."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,10/20/13,"My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.As I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I'd rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I'd rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.The second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it's a Lanzhou thing, I don't know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn't expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. The fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. The fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. Needless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,2/26/15,"A nice Chinese in the west of town, came here with a friend that is a regular and likes this place and he was a bit surprised to see that the menu and inteior design has changed.The place as it is now looks a bit depressing, he said it was more authentic before. Now the walls are painted in a grey-ish brown tone with what seems to be some old traditional drawing on the wall.The staff was very kind and the place was full of people.The menu was packed with good things but because I wasn't too hungry I just had vegetarian noodles with fried tofu and could even barely finish - it's a very hearty dish with homemade noodles and lots of veggies! On our table there was a little wooded ducky with our chopsticks on it - loved it!For starters we got a complimentary cucumber and seaweed salad.Still can't understand how such a simple thing can be so wonderful, we tried to figure out what's in it for a little while - so sesame seeds, fresh chilis, garlic, soy sauce, little pieces of seaweed and probably some other stuff we couldn't figure out.This was a highlight.To sum it all up.. A nice place with good food, I'll come back to check out some more dishes :)"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/5/14,"A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Sch?neberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? Turns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it's still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! I had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new d?cor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!Anyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Fr?hlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .The Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  My only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. My lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!The whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about ?27. Will come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!"
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/16/16,"A friend from Yunnan took me here with a group of friends. It was by far the best Chinese food I had in a restaurant in Germany!! Order their Sichuan and Yunnan stuff. It was soo flavorful and spicy and perfect! This is as authentic as it gets among the legions of sad Vietnamese ""China Thai Sushi Imbiss""....."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,4/9/15,"I'm Chinese and I think I am in a good place to say whether this restaurant is authentic.Well it is. I could go there days in a row.I definitely have a Northern's taste./They have good spicy stuffs./ They have original decorations (check the toilettes for ex)Just sometimes I wonder what the waitresses are doing because they keep ignoring people......They are lovely girls though, whenever I get the oppotunity to talk to them....."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,5/19/16,"We loved it! Went there ysterday and had a fun time with great food. The chicken curry was especially delicious! A little bit on the spicier side though ;) waitresses are sweet, too."
Selig,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,4/17/10,"Popular Chinese restaurant with a nice selection of open wines from around the world for 3,90 a glass. All kinds of guests - from families to a company that planned a trip to China. And then of course the incredibly sweet gay couple in love. Duck lovers will probably love this place, since there's a variety of dishes on that theme. I'm a seafood fan myself, so I had the ""Selig Plate"" of assorted seafood for 9,50 euro - served with rice or noodles. The seafood quality was good, but like all Chinese food, my dish wasn't really hot. We asked for some extra chili on the side to spice it up a bit."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,10/21/15,"This is a massive operation; right across the Chinese embassy. On a Wednesday evening, it was packed, with both Chinese and non-Chinese diners inside. There were plenty of Chinese diners; that for me was a good sign.We decided to stick to ordering little things, and avoiding the main dishes. By the way, the main dishes are huge, so bring an appetite in case you want to order one of those (they come with rice). We ordered the 1000-year-old eggs (we liked it so much we ordered a second one), the spicy tripe, steamed dimsum with pork and vegetables, as well as small servings of the shark fin soup, as well as the sea cucumber soup. We also ordered a pair of non-alcoholic cocktails, simply because their juices looked interesting enough.Oh, the millennium eggs were great! It looked disgusting, but it melts in your mouth. I loved it. I haven't had it here in Berlin, until now. I was missing it, so it was time to feast on it. The spicy tripe was also a great dish. It was not too hot, in my opinion, although I remember them marketing it as rather hot. I guess it's not Szechuan cuisine. Regardless, I loved it.And finally, the dimsum, which was heavenly.The soups were interesting, but I should say that the shark fin soup had more hype than taste. I can't say I hate it, but I am not a fan. I guess it is just popular because of its ingredients, but I didn't really see why people make a big deal of it. In my opinion, I found the sea cucumber soup tastier.Overall, I had a good experience here. I would definitely come back again."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,6/3/17,"It's a reasonably nice place, the waiters were friendly, no problems, the food was... ok. Not great, but ok. The buffet is pretty small and lacks some more sauces (if you offer duck, fish, etc. by itself, I expect more sauces to go with it than just sweet&sour). One meat (I think it was beef) was only lukewarm at best and pretty chewy, which was also true for some of the other stuff. Personally, I would not recommand the buffet, but we will probably go again and try something from the menu."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,12/26/15,People say that it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin but I think it might be a bit overrated. There is a big selection of food. Even the most fancy things like shark fins. The menu is very authentic. My boyfriend and I (both from China) decided to have some daily food though. We had Dan Dan Mian (sichuan noodle) and sauer sweet fish. The portion of the sauer sweet fish was not very big. It tastes okay but not so amazing. The noodle was too soft and it was just a bowl of noodle. There should be more meat. The kiwi alcohol free cocktail was disgusting. The staff was friendly though. And the price was okay. Maybe I will try the all you can eat or the more fancy stuff some other day.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,6/8/16,The buffet is huge and full if interesting stuff... Very good for 15 euros..Some of the food are slightly customized to western tastes so that bit is irritating... The dumplings are fresh and tasty...Everything else is quite good and authentic.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,7/6/14,"One of the best Chinease Restaurants in Berlin. They have a huge selection of dishes on the menu, way more that you will find in a lot of other places. The menu is really Chinease with a lot of ""exotic"" dishes like pigs ears, intestines, chicken feet etc. We had some starters and some meat dishes. The portions are really generous and the meat dishes come with rice. I will certainly go back there, great find. The location is also nice, you can sit outside and have a direct view on the Spree."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,8/21/14,"I'm Chinese and the food here is awful. The Beef dish was too salty. We also got the duck pancake, wow the pancake they used was soggy and not the correct one I rate that ""F"" Bad Bad. Close to Potsdamer Platz there is a GOOD duck pancake place Pek-Ente or something.Dim sum nothing special. Overall, I will NOT return."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,4/22/12,"Real chinese restaurant across the street of the Chinese Embassy. Once, when  I was invited to the 60. Anniversary of the Republic of China Act in the Embassy, this restaurant was the caterer. God food, some of them so authentic, that you are warned by the staff. I highly recommend this restaurant"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,7/8/12,"I gave 2 stars mainly because of the Unfriendly Waiter who made me feel sorry about asking anything,I assume he's the son of the owner. Unfriendly and somehow rude.Food is Ok, a bit on the pricey side considering the quality of the food:We got Half Duck which was good, but the sauce was far too acid.Rice was good.Vegetables were ok, but not worthy of 8EUR.Won ton soup with prawns is too expensive, 5,80EUR for a very small portion,and taste too much like sesame sauce. I tried many chinese restaurants and this one is not gonna be on my list,def. i won't go back to eat here."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,4/12/14,"This place is amazing! The location is very easy to get to, and the menus have ENGLISH! The english menu made the restaurant quite welcoming and put us at ease when ordering. The food itself is quite good, and the service is reasonable by Berlin/European standards."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,7/4/13,Authentic Sichuan cuisine. One of the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to when I'm abroad.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,12/30/12,"The mixed review from this restaurant is probably because of its originality and Non Asians, who are used to the cheap Asian noodles around the corner.The food is typical food of the zhejiang province. They don't do dim sums, so I didn't bother ordering dim sum. I have been here a couple of times already. If you want to experience original zhejiang cooking this is the place and order from the menu. I've tried the buffet, but the quality is not the same."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,7/7/12,"Standing proudly just across from the Chinese Embassy I expected a great deal from this Restaurant. The food was mediocre, the restaurant looks reasonable nice and it's relatively clean. Although I got a dirty knife and a dirty look for asking for a replacement knife. The Mapo Tofu was not like any I'd seen before in my life and there was about 9 grains of mince in the sauce which I know because they were so few I could count them. They have a wide selection of Dim Sum and I had a selection, I was only really satisfied with one of the selections the others tasted like rubber (probably because they were using rubber in the steamers) . I have, unfortunately, no Idea where they got the good reputation they are supposed to have."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,7/14/13,It's hard to find good authentic Chinese Food outside of China.  This place is awesome.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,3/3/12,"fantastic food. huge selection from many Chinese regions and perfectly done. especially interesting is the dim sum selection  i cant seem to have enough of those and find myself coming back again and again.the prices are moderate (45EUR for a couple) and the service is very professional.on Sunday there is a buffet that is boring and not recommended."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,8/12/11,"I've been to the Ming Dynasty I several times, every visit has been a success, good food and good service. The highlight was the the Feuertopf (hot pot) which I shared with a friend one Christmas Eve. Lovely sauces and generous amounts of food. They top up everything as much as required, even the prawns which my friend really tucked into. The tofu was the freshest and the best I can remember having and it was the first time I had the sliced noodles. The peanut/chilii sauce is to die for.I have also had the buffet for Sunday lunch. This is very good (and good value as well), if not as much a gourmet experience as the hot pot. A good selection of noodles, meat dishes,fish, spring rolls and even some sushi. In particular I enjoyed the crispy duck and the fried prawns/shrimps. The food is continually topped up so things don't run out, even the popular items.Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town!"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,2/5/11,"Great dim sum,tasty wantons(i really love the fried one),to mantion the fried chicken with shenchuan pepper::is a twice fried chicken meet with skin,covered with a mountain of dry chilly.the dish havo no sauce at all and it's very spice.The desserts are bit boring,the usual banana frittes,and ice creams.Authentic chinese food."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,5/29/09,"Terrific food, with a range of unusual items that one rarely sees in standard Chinese restaurants. No doubt its location right across from the Chinese embassy helps to get the kitchen honest. Certainly worth a visit."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,12/12/08,"Arguably the best Chinese in town. Good friends is good too and has more roast meats, but Ming Dynasty has a better dim sum and vegetarian menu. The wantons are really really yummy, with a little bit of lemongrass in the stuffing - miam miam. The only negative point is there a very light wine list: there's like 2 reds to choose from and no ros? (which is really de rigueur with Chinese food). Last time I was there I had the 'Great Wall red (produced in China) and it really wasn't that good. The traditional Peking Duck is a must (book 24hrs in advance), as well as the fondue (really popular with their Chinese clientele it seems)."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,10/23/17,"Very nice restaurant. It was quite busy when we came in, but after a 5 minute wait we were sat in a shared table with other people.The food was very good, with one exception, which was the chicken in the soup wasn't that tasty."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,1/3/18,"Really disappointing to see one of my favorites spots in Berlin turned into an insufferable hype! Monsieur Vuong used to be my go to spot for no-frills Asian food, 15 years ago that is. Since then, the neighborhood as well as the rest of Berlin has seen a dramatic change and boom in restaurants specializing in Asian cuisine. Main reason I keep going back to MV is because of the fond memories, but food-wise there are many other (better) options around the area. Furthermore, every year I return, the crowd and the worsening service has made the experience extremely unpleasant. The last straw was the last visit, when surprisingly, there's wasn't a huge line or a crowd. Regardless, the manager who seated us was inhospitable and rude, and when we took upon ourselves to move from the bar area where she'd seated us to a table that became available, she literally screamed at us across the restaurant to move back. Her ranting was so inappropriate, for moment, I thought the table was on fire.Her behavior was totally unacceptable and neither is the hype!"
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,7/3/17,"Disclaimer: this review contains the opinion of a Vietnamese-American with the appropriate ethnic palate. On behalf of this restaurant as someone who is not affiliated in any way, I'd like to apologize to those of you who have dined here seeking to appease their Vietnamese cravings. This restaurant has disappointed you.To remedy the cold winter here, what better way to combat that runny nose than a bowl of Pho? Pulled out my trusted Yelp and saw the great reviews and next thing you know- Uber there! I know now that most of the great reviews were written by non-native tongues. In other words, go to Orange County (a hub of Los Angeles) first and experience what Pho is supposed to be by the hands of the largest Vietnamese population outside VN. Man I should've known as soon as we walked in that even with the small ethnic enclave of Asians in Berlin, why ain't there any Asians in here besides the workers?! The restaurant was busy with a party waiting outside, the assumption was that this has to be the best Vietnamese food in Berlin. I'm so disappointed in my people. We did not stay true to preserve our culture. Instead we watered it down and gave a compromised product to appease the clientele we serve. Look, I get it- who's cutting the check? But still, you didn't have to take it to levels of canned pasta almost. Instant Pho packages are on par here. The Pho tasted like a can of beef broth. There was no subtle taste of the important anise, any kind of traditional aroma, hell even the selection of meat that came with it was surprising! The entire restaurant was full with how do you say- Anglos. I knew there was no saving this bowl. Not honorable mentions of this meal: the worst spring rolls (if we can call it that) and goi (Viet salad) any one outside of Berlin could stomach."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,12/30/17,"The place is loud is super hectic, especially the bar area. If you don't want to stand in the line for long, you can sit at the bar but it is super loud and you will have limited space. Service is fast but don't expect a friendly service.The food is fresh and tasty but not authentic. Something common with Vietnamese food in Berlin."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,1/14/18,"Can't praise this place enough! Had the Canh Mien today on my last day in Berlin. Amazing!!! DELICIOUS vegetarian option, and I don't use that word lightly. Also happy there were no eggs in it since I really don't like them and often vegetarian soups have them. Extremely flavourful broth and super filling for 8 euros. Highly recommend!"
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,12/5/17,A few selction of viet soups. Very fee selection of specials. Though nice service. A expect a better experience :(
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/27/17,"Service was quick and nice. Pho was amazing - different soup than I had at other places - the soup was rich of flavors like ginger, spring onion, parsley... instead of greasier and saltier type of pho I had before."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,7/13/17,"4 stars is fair... english menu included next to the  german, Vietnamese girlfriend says she would come here in case she misses Pho Bo.Too loud for groups though and don't sit at the bar (hectic and minimal space)A slight feeling of getting stalked by the owner comes up (u will know what I mean when u are here - his face is everywhere!)"
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/25/17,I had noodle soup with my coworkers here. Very good location and delicious Vietnamese food. Also the guy on the cookbook is such a gym bro XD
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,11/13/17,"It was ok , i've had way better in berlin... the people i was with ordered a pretty tasty bowl of curry and of steak , but my pho lacked flavor"
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,1/4/17,"My friend took me to this place while we were in Berlin on a business trip. He raved about this place and how he's been going here for over 10 years.Honestly, it's really awesome Vietnamese food and their pho was out of this world. The pho broth was absolutely amazing and we went a bit crazy and ordered literally everything on the menu. It was all great. I would always go back to this place when I'm in Berlin. Highly recommend the Pumpkin Curry and Pho!"
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,7/12/17,"In general the food is not too bad, but I had the worst experience ever with them recently. I ordered some food via Deliveroo and my Cha Tom Com had a SCREW hidden in it. I was just lucky not to swallow it, this is unacceptable and I would caution everyone going there. The high volume of customers might have impacted their food preparation standards..."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,10/31/16,"Came here a few days ago at the recommendation of a friend. Sadly, his raving review did not match my expectations. I'm a pretty big foodie and a pho lover, so I've had my share of both good and bad pho. I ordered the cha gio and the pho bo (large). The cha gio (also known as egg rolls or imperial rolls) were made differently than how I'm used to (e.g. in a wonton or lumpia wrapper, filled with shredded carrots, vermicelli noodle, shredded shrimp bits), but was actually pretty tasty and good. Instead of using shredded shrimp, Monsieur Vuong uses whole pieces of shrimp with each of their cha gio. The use of whole shrimp gave the cha gio, while fried, a mix between a goi cuon (spring roll) and shrimp tempura feeling. It was a different concept that I actually enjoyed.While the cha gio was tasty, the pho bo was not and was a total let down. First off, no condiments are provided at the table (e.g. Sriracha, chili sauce or hoisin sauce). I asked for the usual chili sauce and hoisin sauce which I like to dip my meat in; sadly, they said they didn't have any but instead could provide their own chili ""sauce"", which was no more than chili peppers preserved in a vinegar/water concoction. Definitely not suitable for pho to dip your meat in! The pho broth flavor wise was pretty decent, it had the typical beef and herbs flavor. But two of the biggest turn offs about the pho broth was the amount of oil that was left in the broth and all the herbs that were used to boil the broth were left inside. Typically, when making you're supposed to use a strainer to strain out all the herbs that were used to make the broth. It was not visually appealing to see multiple star anise, red jujubes, floating around in my broth. You can't eat the star anise or red jujubes, so I'm not sure why they provide them to you in your bowl of pho here! These herbs should always be taken out when serving pho. The presentation definitely was messy and haphazard. Also, the amount of fat/oil left in the broth turned what I normally consider a fairly light and healthy meal into a heavy and decadent one. My mount was pooling with oil with every scoop of broth - not a good feeling.Lastly, I am used to having the side vegetables/garnishes to be provided with a bowl of pho. Here at Monsieur Vuong they don't provide that. Instead they mix in a few strands of bean sprouts in the broth, along with a bunch of cilantro and green onions. I asked my waiter if they had basil, which after showing what a picture of it was, was told that they did not offer basil.So, from my experiences of the pho here can be summed as  an overly oily, messy broth filled that while has pretty good flavor, but cannot be enhanced or augmented with any condiments or side garnishes. Eating pho should be an individual, customizable experience, where you tailor it to your personal preferences and likings. However, Monsieur Vuong lacks this and was a big disappointment. If you're hungry for pho, I'd probably go else where! Not worth the hype in my books."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/25/17,"Was recommended this restaurant from a friend and I tried it while visiting Berlin. It was definitely a highlight of my trip. The chicken pho was absolutely outstanding. We have decent Vietnamese cuisine in Los Angeles, but this place was one of the best I've had. The mixed drinks were very delicious as well. As a bonus, they take credit cards here (unusual for Berlin) and the service was very prompt. I'd be back for sure if I ever find myself in Berlin again."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,2/1/17,"Went to this great place again on my second visit in Berlin time and it was great like the first one, took the spring rolls with shrimps and noodle dish with duck meat that was a blast.The home made ice tea is highly recommended."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,9/21/17,"A delightfully charming place with delicious Viet style food.  However if you're a stickler for 100% authentic then this is not the place for you.  This is not Westminster, CA or San Jose, CA style Viet food but that doesn't mean it still can't be enjoyable.  Remember, you're in Berlin with a more limited Viet population.  Give the place a break.  We happily dined here 3 times during our Berlin trip."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,5/27/17,Another good East-Berlin Vietnamese food option. The nc chanh mui is excellent and the glass noodle salad mekong is as good as the Houston viet-town staples I grew up with.
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,3/2/17,"The best Vietnamese food I've ever had. We had the Pho Ga, Pho Bo, fried spring rolls & ice gold beers. Delicious!!! 5 stars! Must try in Berlin.This place is pretty hip, highly recommended for a fun night out for couples or friends."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,8/7/17,"The hype made me expect more but it was just a solid vietnamese joint. Nothing too special. The menu list was pretty short, the noise level was a bit high, but the food was clean and good. The price was pretty on point, not too pricey for what you get. Overall, not a place I would crave to go back to but worth the visit if you are in the area and are craving Vietnamese food."
Monsieur Vuong,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,7/17/16,"We came here after the place we were originally going to go to turned out to be closed. All the seats outside were filled when we walked by, so we figured it would be pretty good. The interior was modern and nice, so I took it as a good sign. Our group of 6 was seated pretty much immediately, though we had to sit inside where it was kind of warm (not fun in the summer). I ordered a de chanh deluxe, a drink with lime juice, cane sugar, soda, and white rum. I also ordered a pho hanoi, or pho with chicken. When the drinks came, they looked amazing. After a couple sips of mine, I saw something floating under the limes...it turned out to be a small dead bug. No big, it happens. I ask the server for a replacement one, which she promptly serves. The second one seemed to be better as it had more rum in it...then I see ANOTHER dead bug, same type as before. Now not feeling so well, I tell the server again, and she seems shocked/horrified. She asks if I want a different drink, and I politely decline. Aside from that fiasco, the pho itself was strange too. The soup was pretty salty, and when we asked for the standard sriracha/hoisin sauce, our server said they didn't have any. No hoisin sauce with pho?? Well, it would've been way too salty the way the pho was anyway. The noodles were fine, but the chicken was dry and in over-proportion. I finished most of it anyway out of hunger...Oh yes, and the server didn't hear me order a small bowl so I got a big bowl of that stuff too ;( The service is friendly enough, and I don't blame them too much. This was definitely not your traditional pho, and I'm not sure if I enjoyed that. The drink situation just makes me sad because otherwise it was a good drink! At least they took it off the bill in the end. I probably wouldn't recommend you go here if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food."
Mutter,Thai,4,?11-20,5,5/8/14,"Mutter... The name alone has that feeling of homeliness about it, but you would be wrong in this case to assume it refers to the German word for 'mother'. Rather in this case it means 'Nut' as in Nut and Bolts or as I see it, the Nut that keeps my screwy personality in balance... keeping me fed and watered is not a job to be undertaken by the weak and faint hearted!  Like a Nut it has many sides to its personality ...During the day Mutter serves as a caf? where you can enjoy a nice breakfast, one of the lunchtime specials on offer or a simple coffee and slice of cake. Sometimes I have lunch meetings here because there are plenty of nice quiet corners to set up shop in, especially if you need to get connected to the interweb!This is a bit like a home from home for me.The place is bright and airy with plenty of areas to choose from. Inside there is a main dining area upstairs with its own bar, the principle bar is situated downstairs and separated by a smaller area at the entrance of Mutter. From the  Main Bar you can access the main outdoor seating area which in winter becomes tented complete with heaters. A little lounge area can also be found outside on the other side of mutter, nice to just hang with friends in the sun, shaded areas are also provided.In the evening it transforms itself into a lively bar and bustling restaurant noted for its Thai cuisine.  The food is excellent especially for those who like their food sssssssssssspicy, perfect to extinguish with a nice cold beer or a tasty cocktail.  My go to dish here is the Beef Pad Kee Mao, a Chinese influenced spicy fried rice noodle dish, aka 'Drunken noodles'... perfect to serve in a bar!  For an alternative I might have the Beef Krapao Nua sab, a stir fried beef in chilli and basil dish served with steamed rice or the Pad Prik Suii, Beef in a thick spicy pepper sauce.  But my all-time favourite is the Pad Kee Mao. Also available to go ;) Other tasty things on the menu include: Gaeng Pet Ped Jangt (a roast duck with red curry), Gaeng Pet Gai (chicken coconut red curry) served in a pineapple or a nice juicy papaya salad. Sometimes you might find a tender roast beef on the daily specials menu, also good. Prices are fair considering the quality and the portions.The Staff are very friendly and helpful! During major Sporting events, Mutter provides screens inside and out so you can watch matches live whilst enjoying a nice cool beer amongst a friendly local and international crowd... rewind to World Cup 2010... only England supporter in bar full of Germans apart from the Irish guy who was obviously also supporting Germany!  What can I say...I survived...but then we did loose and there was that awkward moment when it seemed I was the only voice to be heard when England scored its only goal! Heavens this review might have taken a different turn had England won!By the way Mutter is also a great location for private functions and parties complete with DJs that will make you want to dance until all hours of the morning, well at least until the Ordungsamt arrive!"
Mutter,Thai,4,?11-20,5,9/5/16,"I came here for the second time (my first time was two years ago) today to have a coffee and maybe some dessert and hang out while I blog and plan in my bullet journal :) The place is great. Nice music playing at a decent level, a really friendly and fast waitress, and free wifi! The Milchkaffee was pretty good and one can also order tap water which came in a large glass with ice! That's what I call service! When I ate here last time, the food was delicious! And their bar looks pretty good with plenty to offer. I will def. return for some cocktails with friends!"
Mutter,Thai,4,?11-20,4,9/20/12,Empfohlen. Kraeftige Cocktails.
Sisaket,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/10/17,"Soups and excellent dishes. Reasonable prices. Simple decor where you can relax in sober colors and many sculptures from elsewhereSoupes et plats excellents. Prix raisonnables. D?cor sobre o? on peut se d?tendre dans des coloris sobres et de nombreuses sculptures d'ailleurs"
Sisaket,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,1/24/17,"Amazing food. Nice presentation, good prices (the lunch menu 11:00-16:00 is exceptional value for money), jazz music playing, candle and flower an the table, friendly service, very clean toilets. No wifi."
Sisaket,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/8/17,The chicken larb was very yummy. My pad krapaow was good but not as spicy as I would have liked it to be. But they did have fish sauce with Thai chilis to add spiciness. Authentic Thai food in Berlin.
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/24/17,"The food and service were both outstanding  I highly recommend this place. It is a quiet little restaurant with a relaxing atmosphere. The service was great. They brought our dishes out on a warmer so we could take our time eating and it never got cold. They have a great selection of dishes and drinks. So if you're looking for a place with great prices and great food, this is it!"
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/31/15,Good pricess and good chinese food. I have only went there for a take-away meal. Perfect for that.
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/8/13,"We go here almost every week since we have moved in this neighborhood. The typical decorated spacy place is purely family-driven, owner Si Mei is very very friendly. The food is mandarin cuisine, just excellent and prizes are absolutely low. My recommendation is the hot plate with prawns."
Lodd Thai Imbiss,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,1/1/17,"After 5 years of living in this neighborhood in Berlin, I still order here 4-5 times a month, eating my way through the menu. My new favorite, Phad Grapau with chicken. Now you don't even have to ask, if the menu says a dish is spicy, then it is, if not then just order some nam prik on the side. As always, the summer rolls with shrimp are a trusted and delicious starter. They used to come with the sweet, spicy & sour vinegar dip and Hoisin sauce, but for some reason they skipped the vinegar dip, no big deal though, since I make it myself and always have a jar in the fridge. Don't ever go away, Thai Lodd."
Lodd Thai Imbiss,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,9/5/16,"Waaaaaiting. Long long long waiting. Always.I guess they could improve that. Maybe by deleting 45 of the 50 dishes they offer. Those dishes are all very tasty by the way!"
Lodd Thai Imbiss,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,2/5/16,"My favorite Thai restaurant in Neuk?lln. The food and sauces are prepared fresh on the spot. Food is authentic and Thai hot. Prices are very reasonable. This is more an Imbiss than restaurant, but you come here for the food not the ambience."
Lodd Thai Imbiss,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,6/11/14,I'm pretty surprised by the other reviews!  I had the Tom Yam Gai and Pad Ki Mau and both were quite spicy (I'm a spice fan) and flavorful. This has become my go-to for a nice bite to eat.  I'm not sure why it has 4 euros signs. All the dishes that I remember seeing were under 10 euros.
Lodd Thai Imbiss,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,8/1/15,This Thai place is the most authentic one in Berlin that I know of. Don't let the crappy interior distract you. Pick any item from the menu and you will be warped back to your last Thailand visit. Enjoy.
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,12/30/17,"This place has good Korean Bibimbap. I live in LA and the only thing that could make it better was to have the beef warm in the pot. The clay pot was awesome and the spiciness of the flavors warmed me from the inside. This place is popular, so have a reservation or be patient and wait.   It's well worth it."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,11/16/17,"Can't think of anything about this place that was less than exceptional. Sure, it's a bit pricey to eat in, but it was well worth if you want to sit down and enjoy a nice, hot, hearty meal. The atmosphere of the place had a cool yet quaint vibe. I went in the afternoon during off hours and there was still a nice crowd of people in there- a sign that the food is good!It's also in a great location right across from the s-bahn.My boyfriend got the ramen burger and we shared a salmon sushi roll and edamame. The sushi roll was just okay, nothing too special and kind of fell apart. The edamame was better than most I've had in US sushi restaurants.I'm not sure what my dish was called, but it was piping hot the entire time, had dimensions of flavor, and tasted insanely fresh. It had rice at the bottom, poached eggs, large chunks of sashimi salmon and tuna, pickled carrots, greens, and bean sprouts. One of the best meals I've had in Europe during my trip, and an unforgettable one. Generous portion sizes as well!"
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,8/2/17,"This place is close to where I work, and so I have ordered take-away for lunch from this place several times now. It's a good Korean restaurant, slightly on the higher mid-range side when it comes to price, but they do charge cheaper when you order for take-away, so it isn't a bad deal at all. The dining room is slightly small, and can be crowded during lunch time, so I do prefer to order take-away for this reason as well. They have good options, though I must say it is not on the adventurous side. If you want Korean food that can shock, this is not the place for it. But if you want Korean food that can add color to your workforce lunch meeting, then this would definitely do the trick."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,5/24/17,"Seoulkitchen is insanely delicious! I had the salmon and tuna maki, both of which were standard size and tasted fresh! I definitely recommend ordering sushi here if you are a fan. I also had the beef bibimbap. It came out fresh and hot! It stayed hot throughout the whole meal and all the ingredients provided amazing flavor. The veggies and meat tasted and felt fresh. The two sauces that came with the bibimbap added an extra kick of tastiness to the meal. I highly recommend ordering the beef bibimbap. Not only is it yummy, but the potion is large enough to stuff you! I have been told that I eat like a horse and even I had to take a good chunk in a to-go box.The atmosphere is very pleasant as the dim lighting gives off an intimate and comfortable setting. Additionally, the brick walls and metallic chairs provide a cool industrial flair. The place gets packed quick. I came an hour after opening and every seat was taken. Luckily, I only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. After ordering, the dishes came out just as quick as you would expect fast food to be retrieved; yet, as mentioned above, the flavor is superb and will not disappoint. The staff here are respectful and very helpful. Great people and excellent food."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,6/17/17,"The people there are really friendly and they make outstanding good Sushi. The BBQ is amazing and the place itself is quite cozy and has a nice flair.They forgot our order at first, but quickly caught up. To be recommended- bars all over the place for a nice little drink after this asian fusion experience."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,4/25/16,"This place has been around for idk how long and every time I walked by, I promised myself to go inside one day. Today was said day.It's boiling hot in there, the dark wooden yet urban chic interior makes it seem like a sauna. ""Seoul Kitchen"" operates with an open kitchen, if only they made the 'dirty dish wagon' disappear.The menu offers a variety of authentic Korean dishes as well as sushi and ramen. From what I've seen, the price range is reasonable and easily affordable for anyone who wants to splurge on authentic Asian cuisine on a student budget or any food porn addict with a hungry Instagram crowd to feed.Beverage-wise, ""Seoul Kitchen"" offers soda classics, beer, wine and three shakes, one of them being the refreshing and original apple mint soda - if only it came either chilled or with ice cubes.We opted for the Korean BBQ with beef - definitely not on the cheap side with 17,50? per person. It was served with five Korean appetizers (pickled radish, kimchi, etc.), four kinds of veggies, glass noodles, two sauces and a huge plate of top-notch quality beef. Actually, it was quite too much for the two of us. I'll definitely come back to try the ramen burger and beef bulgogi.Wish they offered desserts, though."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,9/28/17,Really good sushi. Great decor.  I need to go back for the bibimbap which looked awesome.
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,5/23/17,So so so good! Loved the food and would go back if I had more time in Berlin. I'd recommend this place to friends for a quick lunch while they are traveling around. Fit perfectly into the day.
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,2,1/16/17,"I've been here several times, and the food is really nice, so kudos for that. I really like the chilli ramen and for anyone who is interested, I would recommend it.However, unfortunately the last three times I've been there with various company, the service has been very bad. The last two times, so bad and rude infact, we left without ordering and will probably not return there.So the food is really good, but be prepared for a major let down."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,5/27/17,"Would recommend but disappointing kimchee. 5 stars earned because everything else was fantastic, taste and presentation were far better than the price would suggest. Miso, bi bim bap, and the sushi platter (I forget which) were all great. Kimchee was too sour and didn't have enough flavor, but was better when mixed with more chili paste and in the bi bim bap. Absolutely worth a visit if you're staying near the east side gallery, be careful to get a reservation or come before or after dinner though because when we were there almost every table was reserved- lucky to be seated."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,10/13/16,"I stopped by Seoulkitchen on a whim while walking by, and I'm glad that I did.  One day into my trip to Berlin, I was already over German food.  I needed something with vegetables in it.  I had a bibimbap with beef, and it was excellent, as was the accompanying kimchi.  Service was good.  I'd definitely go back."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,6/6/17,"Cool place for Asian food.  I ordered ramen burger.  It was a bit difficult to eat like a burger but delicious with fork and knife. The spice here is hotter than american,  so be careful when ordering.  Also it's cash only.  There's a shady atm down the hill at the end off building."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,9/25/16,"I'm giving this place the full stars. Perhaps all German Koreans are this great? --  I'm only familiar with the ones in NYC , and in comparison this place is stellar. First of all the atmosphere works well:  on the dark side but with big windows facing the busy sidewalk on Warschauerstrasse it lets you withdraw and watch the show. Music is soft, upbeat loungey w hints of new age. I got there early 12:30 pm and the place was relatively empty. Service was good and friendly and attentive with that sweet Asian type friendliness where you almost expect them to bow with their smiles. I had the Chicken Udon Soup w Wheat Noodles. Served w a little Kimchi based salad it was warming and loving. Had it w a mint tea -- fresh mint leaves. I guess I'm a sucker for these types of simple and pure, good spots that hold the balance between sophisticated and down-to-earth, cozy but not cramped, with soothing lighting and music.  Where you feel pampered.  Plus I do love Korean."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,2/14/17,"Really tasty food. Very cool small restaurant with bare brick walls, and big wooden tables. All tables were reserved when we arrived, but we were seated at a table reserved for an hour later, so no problem, but I guess if you want to be sure to have a seat, it might be a good idea to reserve a table. The food was so good! I amNot here well-known in Korean food, so I amNot sure if its all this good, but I really appreciated the both well-spiced and fresh food. I had the chicken ramen, and was surprised by the lack of ""soupness"" of the dish. The chicken was so deliciously marinated. My boyfriend had the crispy chicken, and oh the crisp! The service was friendly and quick. The ambience in the restaurant was underlined by the Korean barbecue by the tables, fizzing with heat. If I was longer in Berlin I would definitely come back. The price was also reasonable, I think we ended up paying around 30? for both food and beer."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,5/6/16,"Delicious food, friendly staff.Dumplings were absolutely perfect and edamame were lightly drizzled with a soy sauce semi hot salsa that made it very interesting. Good, thick and fresh salmon slices in our sushi variation. The house specialty (I.e Korean bbq) was both times absolutely divine. We had the beef both times and with the help from the more than willing to help staff of the restaurant we had great success with it. Only (slight) negative comment I have to make is the lack of a credit/debit card reader which leaves cash as the only possible means of paying."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,8/28/16,"I was craving for sushi and this place was on the way. And it was totally worth it. They have delicious wakame salad. Sushi is pretty good too, and the portions are very generous (mind it when ordering). Simple, tasteful interiors. Friendly staff. Cash only."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,2/5/17,Good korean food place! Had the ribs- quite tender and generous portion. Medium - high spicy
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,6/3/16,"I've been there 3 times. Love the food. Prices are OK. The stuff is pleasant and very fast. You need a reservation as it is usually crowded due to the location. Gonna come back."
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,5/19/17,this restaurant is very near my work and i go here very often. the food is very good and fresh and with affordable prices. the staff is not always friendly.
Seoulkitchen,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,1/29/16,"Great Korean food. Price is a little bit higher, but as expected in this area!I would recommend the Bi Bim Bap Beef! It's delicious"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,12/21/17,"The food was really good, esp. When you order a beef-based meal. Staff friendly.Yum Yum!"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/15/17,"Crowded on a rainy afternoon when I was craving noodle soup.  Jjampong was packed with shrimp, squid and mussels and chewy noodles and a spicy broth.  I wasn't expecting to find decent Korean food in Berlin but this hit the spot."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,1,12/5/17,"All the vegetarian dishes aren't vegetarian. There is always chicken in the broth or fish sauce in the dish. That is criminal, don't go there!"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/26/16,"My husband and I were looking for a quick light lunch spot in Mitte and came across YamYam.  We had a look at the menu and saw that they had kimbap which are traditional Korean rice rolls with vegetables and thought ""that's perfect for a light lunch"" and off we went.Food: YamYam had a lot of great traditional Korean dishes on the menu which was great to see.  Looking around the restaurant the dolsot bibimbap was very popular, the ramen looked good as well as the rice dishes.We both ordered the beef kimbap roll, one order of tofu and veggie dumplings, and a side order of the cucumber kimchi.  FYI - the kimbap comes with a side of kimchi.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  For drinks we ordered a bottle of water and their Korean barely tea.Cost: 22.00?Ambiance: Very casual.Service: Friendly and quick.  We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering.Would I go back? Definitely!  And I would recommend this spot to anyone who's looking for good Korea in Berlin.Note: YamYam is cash only."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,8/28/16,"I've had a lot of Korean food in my time and I'd say this place has been one of my favorites. The food doesn't carry that heavy fermented flavor that a lot of Korean foods have, which is great in my book. It might turn some diehard Korean eaters away on the other hand though. Plenty of food for the price."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,4/3/17,"The food was pretty good, and the service was too - though I did go at a time when the restaurant wasn't packed so I'm not sure what the service may be like during rush hour. A huge selection of food; it was hard to choose what to eat because everything sounded good. The prices were similar to those of other Korean restaurants in Berlin."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/27/17,Quick service with hot food. Kimchi was excellent to start and very spicy (in a good way). We also had Bibimbab with veggies - awesome flavor especially in burning pot. I recommend mixing and add a tiny bit of soy sauce. The Dan Bokum severed quite a large portion and was also good. We would order all plates again next time.
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,1/21/16,"I was craving watermelon soju after walking around all day during the summer, so my friends and I decided to try YamYam since it received good reviews on Yelp. I really loved the watermelon soju from here. It was so refreshing and not too heavy on the soju. I also ordered the zampong (spicy soup with thick noodles, vegetables, and seafood) and the mung bean pancake (with vegetables and seafood). While the dishes weren't the best Korean food that I've had, they were still satisfying and reasonably priced. The zampong could've used more seafood and the mung bean pancake could've used more seasoning, but overall I think everyone enjoyed their dinner."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/2/15,"I had no idea that there are loads of Koreans in Berlin. In fact, there are many second generation Koreans there now which is evident given the number of Korean restaurants we saw throughout the city.We came to Berlin for the weekend - deprived of proper Korean restaurants in Zurich - thought we'd give YamYam a try as it was a recommendation from a friend. Really glad we came here - this place is legit!There is a wide selection of Korean food at this restaurant.  Usually Korean restaurants stick to a few options to specialise in certain dishes.  But these guys had everything from mandoo, dolsot bibimbap, gimbap, soups, etc.  Only negative for the restaurant is you had to pay for panchan... it's a shame but it's the norm in London so wasn't new to me.The service was fantastic.  In fact, we were served by a German guy who spoke Korean (as well as 6 other languages!!!) who was super friendly.  Everything tasted great - and this is coming from a US West Coaster who is used to eating lots of Korean food!  Best part is it's really priced well - definitely will be coming back!"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,7/17/14,"Having travelled extensively in Korea for five years I grew to love Korean food. In my opinion it's the best hangover food that is also healthy ;-)) I had the craving for Korean food for the aforementioned reasons so I went looking ;-))The place is located on a wonderful street with loads of fashion boutiques, jewellery, book shops, knick knacks and hair salons. It also happens to have a load of nice interesting cafes serving different types of Asian food and so on. It was my first time in this part of Berlin and, I loved it. There are loads of locals and tourists alike at the cafes looking cool, sipping drinks and eating. This place has a really nice menu with loads of side dishes like kimchi, pickled cucumber, spinach salad and so on. For me a Korean meal without sides is not a meal ;-)) I ordered the Beef Mandu pan fried dumplings to start and a Bibimbap for main. The sides were excellent as was the bibimbap. It was quite authentic taste, fabulous flavour and spicy. The Mandu however, was nice but not what I would have expected. Similarly the soup side was a bit too oily and lacked flavour. The service was a tad slow to start but then again, I was there before normal dinner time and staff were only getting ready for dinner as was the kitchen. As time went on it got a whole lot quicker. My craving for Korean food was perfectly satisfied and I would happily come here anyday for a meal. It was not very expensive and food was excellent. Must try the kimchi pizza next time, it looked delicious ;-))"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/1/16,"I was staying at a hotel nearby on a work trip, and after a long day of travel my friend and I decided to have food delivered using Deliveroo. We were craving Korean and saw several Korean food options, and a quick google search showed that YamYam had very positive reviews. I can't attest to the actual restaurant and its facilities, but I can say that the food we ordered and had delivered was excellent! We ordered the jjajangmyun (black bean) noodles, bulgogi, and yangnyum fried chicken. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was perfect. The bulgogi was actually the best I've had in Germany- it was surprisingly very tender and well-seasoned and exactly how it should be. The jjajangmyun was my least favorite of the dishes- the sauce wasn't as rich as it should be and the noodles were slightly soggy, but this is probably due to the fact that we ordered the food for delivery.I was really pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and it really hit the spot (and Deliveroo did a great job in bringing the food to our hotel relatively promptly for a busy evening). And after scrolling through the photos here on Yelp, I only wish we had been able to also eat there again in the restaurant, as the other dishes look amazing!"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/6/16,"Very tasty dishes. Service is not too fast (...) but it is worthwhile waiting.We tasted spinach salad, seaweed salad and dim Sam and steer fried chicken with glass  noodles and rice. Everything was tasty.Warmly recommended"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,1/22/17,"I ordered the Bulgogi which was really yummy if not quite the level of spice/flavour I was hoping for. It's quite a small restaurant, which was fine for me since I was dining alone, but I imagine can be a bit of a pain if you want to go in a large group. The food was served incredibly quickly - I'm talking roughly 5mins - which I'll admit made me a little suspicious of its quality but it was very good. Staff were nice, although there was a shift change during my meal which meant I had to pay before I'd finished eating. It was a bit strange but I preferred it as it meant I didn't have to wait about after eating for the bill (but I imagine some people would be annoyed by this interruption). Overall, tasty food, nice enough staff and incredibly quick service."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,7/26/15,"I like this place, the waiters are very sweet and the food is so god! I love the bibimbap, the bulgoggi and the fried dumplings!"
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/23/16,"I didn't expect much from this place but I loved it.I already noted it down to my classics list.Its middle-sized, bright and lovely place to sit, eat great food, have a drink and talk with friends.Food was amazing. I ordered Bibimbap (8.90 Euros) which is pretty cheap for portion. However, its sauce is hot so be careful. I especially have to mention Beef Bulgogi those guys cooking there. Its amazing. Its a great alternative to Japanese plain Gyu Don.So, go to this place and enjoy your great food with service of super friendly and nice service guys and girls."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,9/27/16,Decent Korean spot. Would def recommend the fried mandu (we got steamed and they were a tad gummy) and the bulgogi bowl. Cool outside seating on a mild Berlin night.
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,1/24/16,"Always great bibimbap! The food is not that pricy, but the drinks are pretty expensive.The place is pretty crowded so it is better to reserve a table in advance."
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/29/15,I can't believe we found a decent Korean place in Germany. I had the babimbap and it was pretty authentic and tasted great. Unfortunately I have to take a star off the banchan (side dish) they were so expensive when we usually get them complementary elsewhere.   I also had a glass of green tea for 3 euro. A bit pricey for tea bag in  glass of lukewarm water.
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/17/16,YUUUMMMM! Speedy service n' spicy goodness all over. The bibimbap comes out sizzling in a hotpot and their seafood soup is a sea haven of clams/shrimp/usw. Recommend!
Yam Yam,Korean,4,?11-20,4,9/4/14,YamYam had been better back in the days. It's stil good no doubt and probably still the best place to have some Bibimbap but their sidedishes are now simply some kimchi instead of the variety they used to had. The interior is minimalistic and the waiter are really nice.
Ho Lo,Asian Fusion,5,?11-20,5,7/10/17,"Nice atmosphere and style, inside & outside seating, super delicious and many vegan options. Love it!"
Ho Lo,Asian Fusion,5,?11-20,5,9/4/16,Lovely new restaurant close to U-Bahn Eisenacher Stra?e. Friendly staff and outdoor seating. The veggie curry was excellent! Definitely will go there again.
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/18/16,"I think I found a new favorite! This place serves honest food for a great price, not hipster and not trendy (rare for prenzl berg). I went for the mango sauce curry and let me tell you that it was one of the best curries I've ever had! The sauce was just out of this world! It was not spicy, which I prefer and served with really crispy fried tofu and rice - absolutely delicious! The place itself is pretty small so if your come with a large group better book a table in advance My mum had the pho and it was okay, not the best one I had but still good so I highly recommend getting the mango sauce dish (the menu is pretty small) I'm definitely coming back!"
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/26/17,"Very good food nice little restaurant also friendly for children We got two different dishes with curry and rice. Very tasty"
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/10/16,"I think it's the best place in the neighborhood for vegans for a budget warm meal. Typical Vietnamese in the way that you need to ask for the bill if you want to stay in the tax paying systemAnd not typical  in the meaning that they are nice to the guest."
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/28/16,"No frills Vietnamese with solid food, sweet servers and a low-key vibe.  The food is cheap and quick, and the outdoor tables are charming for those perfect Berlin summer nights.  Only four stars because while the food is good, it's probably not the absolute best Vietnamese you've ever had."
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/2/16,"Lunch special is great! I order Vegan Mango Curry. This is an ideal place for vegetarian who still like to enjoy the good flavor food without breaking the bank.  Bummer! There is no vegan/vegetarian pho here. Only request, I wish they do not put the side salad and curry in the same bowl... (fear of food touching!)"
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/10/15,I had the Pho soup with beef. It was really good! The place is very simply decorated but still got a cozy feel to it. Nice staff.
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/24/15,"Best beef pho noodle bowl I've had. Big portion left me so full, almost to the point of being uncomfortably full. Worth a visit."
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/18/12,"There are so many subpar Asian restaurants in this city that serve bland, spice-less food adapted to German tastebuds that I am always cautious to venture out to a new Vietnamese place with affordable prices. Saigon New was a nice surprise in that sense, serving up some fresh and tasty noodles, soups and rice dishes. Lots of coriander, fresh vegetables, cinnamon and lemongrass! Had the Bo Tron special for 5? and was delightfully surprised by how good it was. Everyone at my table were happy with what they had ordered. Definitely, a great place to keep in mind!"
Saigon New,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/14/13,"Super tasty! Try any of the chicken curries (yellow, red, Mango)."
Duc Tam Quan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/2/17,"Excellent vietnamese food , pleasantly surprised  great service in this little place , you grab your own beer , the best mango sald i have tried"
Duc Tam Quan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/20/16,"Eat here. I've lived in Germany for 2 years and Asia for 7, and this is the most authentic Vietnamese food I've had in Europe. I didn't try the sushi, and wouldn't, because the Vietnamese food is so fresh and good."
Duc Tam Quan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/1/16,Delicious and authentic. Friendly service. I had the spring rolls and they were a good size. B?n was also good. Clean and cute on the inside of the restaurant.
Som Tam,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,8/19/15,"Order a fried rice to go, food was awsome! Staff was friendly (and hot) looks like a nice place for dinner, good prices aswell. Authenthic thai food!"
Lon-Men,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/10/15,"The best Chinese restaurant in Berlin #not just ""one of""#Tried 4 dishes, loved all of them!Wu xi pai gu (ribs)Handmade fish ball soupShui Zhu yu (spicy fish)Xiang chao ya (duck)For people who want to taste really Chinese food, this is the place."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,8/28/17,"Really great dumplings here (it seems everyone here orders it). I heard they raised their prices and I did think around ?9 is a hefty price for 20 (somewhat small) dumplings but I really did enjoy them and they were very authentic. I also had the kung pao tofu (?10) and it was quite delicious. Overall, the reviews are accurate, I thoroughly enjoyed the food but felt that it was a bit pricey in comparison to other Berlin restaurants."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,5/17/16,"CHEAP. Delicious. Diverse. Flavorful. Plentiful. Homemade. Never Frozen. Authentic. Dumpling. Heaven.2 Thumbs up & a round, happy Tummy!  Enjoy!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,5/25/16,"I had this one on my list for a while already but so far it didn't work out but today was the day... I love dumplings! No matter whether it's the russians or the chinese but these were quality. Because I wanted to try them all I asked whether it's possible to try them all and when the waitress said ""yes"" without hesitating I was already in love with this place! The menu offers 20 piece or 40 piece options either boiled or fried. We took a mix of everything with 40 pieces and it's just the perfect amount to not be too full while still get a good idea of all their flavours. I loved it and I highly recommend to get a ""mixed platter"" (not on the menu).Although I loved every single flavor the ones with salmon did stick out today..."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,8/6/16,"When you have a serious good appetite for dumpling and wish to get a dumpling satisfaction at a reasonable price - then Wok Sho is your place. 20 dumplings (veg/pork/beef/lamb/sea food) for approx 7-8 euro with an option of boiled/fried.This is coupled with a variety of Chinese dishes and drinks."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,12/11/16,This place is very over rated.  We sought it out because we love dumplings and saw good reviews online. We consumed 20 lamb dumplings (below average) and 20 pork dumplings (better but still just average) which we ordered mostly to see if we simply ordered poorly.  I suppose I'd go if I were invited there but I wouldn't go back.  Prices were good at 7.5 Euro for 20 dumplings.  20 dumplings and a beer each will leave you satisfied with enough room for dessert elsewhere.  40 is a lot of dumplings.  One last note - both of our orders were boiled.  Perhaps we should have tried fried dumplings.
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,7/17/16,"so... the food is really great. Flavourful, rich. The dough could be a little thinner but it's ok. I also like the short menu they have. Unfortunately the service is horrible. We were waiting for them to approach us first to get the menus and then to collect our order for approximately 45 minutes! If it was only depending on me, I would have already left the place, especially that there were only 4 other guests. Another annoying thing was that when we ordered all together 6 plates of dumplings they were serving us only 1-2 plates at a time. I would prefer to be served the whole order at the same time... The prices are also higher than before. Around 7 for 20 cooked sumplings and 8 for the fried ones. I am not sure if I will go back mainly because of the service."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,5/17/15,"These are the best dumplings that I have found so far. You get a huge order for a very good price and they are very tasty. Try the tofu soup or the cold chicken salad with peanut sauce as well. Very aromatic. I think these are the most authentic dumplings in Prenzlauer Berg. I would further recommend Lecker Song if you prefer something more visually interesting. Forget all the hipster places further south, though. They have no idea how to make a great dumpling serving like what you get in this place."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,7/9/15,"Just came from it, and yes, sometimes I go all the way from Kreuzberg to Prenzlauer Berg just to eat in there. When I'm in a dumpling mood, oh I love them and They have so many sorts, you can choose, fried or steamed; Let me tell you my favourite one:Pork and Celery, steamed!Perfect to go with a group of friends so you can do the full experience as the smaller portion is 20 uni, 40 uni the biggest, so It's good for sharing, combining ingredients and get to know more than just one taste, and they have that wonderful round table with second surface that you can rotate to get someone else's dish ;) friendly people and English speakers. Price is just perfect! 20uni - 6,50?40uni - 12,50?"
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,4/3/16,"Their dumplings are to die for. The starters are great too, very authentic. I like their tea selection too. The prices are really good even for Berlin. My husband and I usually order starters + dumplings + tea and eat to our hearts' content and the bill is always around 20 EUR. It's a must for people who love chinese dumplings!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,12/29/15,Very authentic food and definitely good for value. Can get quite busy at dinner time but the food definitely worth the long wait
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,11/23/14,"If you love dumplings and if you want a lot of them, then this place is heaven for you. They offer dumplings with different fillings and you can order either a small or large plate of each taste. The problem is, everything sounds so yummy that you'll always order way more than you can eat. But that's ok, as it tastes just like in China. In addition, the prices are really fair and the service is mostly friendly."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,12/25/14,"Very cozy place specialised in Northern China dumpling. LOVE it! We travelled far for this restaurant, it's all worth the efforts! Very friendly staff and huge portion. Authentic taste, I put my Chinese name against is!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/2/16,"The dumplings are real ones, tasty and fresh. I would just wish for a tomato, piece of lettuce or anything colorful as a decoration, because seeing those white dumplings on a white plate without anything else is a bit... sad."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,2/8/13,"Dumplings, Dumplings, Dumplings !!! well done, nice fillings and although made for a small pocket.Walls locking a little bit strange with all those paints, but ok.TRY it!!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,10/15/14,"Cheap dumplings! And lots of them! Come with a bunch of people, cos it definitely is more economical to order a lot than little. It is very filling."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,3/5/15,"Been there yesterday for the first time and it's already one of my favorites. Load of dumplings for every taste, probably 12 different fillings or more, steamed or fried (I had lamb and chinese cabbage, fried, very good, thank you!), and very cheap too. Classic chinese beer. And some other stuff too (I had duck and it was delicious)."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,5/26/16,"Had a wonderful party of 15 ppl here. The dumplings are the best in Berlin by far, great for a large group of ppl and the staff was very accomodating."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,2/1/15,"Fantastic dumplings at a very reasonable price. Pleasant service, a little slow but it can get crowded. I got the fried vegetarian dumplings. Flavorful filling, thin tender wrappers with a great crispy bottom. A number of sauces at the table rounded out the meal."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,11/15/13,"Came here with a friend last Saturday night.  Finally, AUTHENTIC Chinese food in Berlin!Ordered jasmine tea, 20 cabbage dumplings (steamed), cubed tofu in a delicious sauce (I forget the name) and double pan fried chicken.  Total flavorgasm and I was stuffed afterward!This place is a must. Be sure to make a reservation, we were rushed out after two hours to make room for people waiting. It was packed."
Wok Show,Chinese,4,Under ?10,2,11/11/12,"Lots of average potstickers for an ok price. They are made fresh, which is nice, but it was hard to distinguish between the three different types that we ordered...and that is sorta gross. But, if you get off on giant portions, then here you go. You should check this restaurant out. That is to say, if you are the type of guy or gal who would say to themselves, ""I like seeing a serving of 60 of these dumplings on one plate and it makes me happy,"" then you will fall in love with this place. On a side note:Why pay extra for frying? Are you trying to keep all the cheap and poor fat people away?Also, it seems as if only Asian people eat here."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/11/16,"This is difficult for me to admit, but yes-I am a closet yelper. I have rarely been satisfied enough by my meal to consider cracking open the door of repression and sharing my experiences with others, and lesser times yet without the influence of alcohol, but the meal I enjoyed at this restaurant tonight is worth sober-waving a rainbow colored (or whatever series of colors yelp lurkers are represented by) flag for. I am a cheap person and was delighted to find reasonably priced food. You can expect to pay about 10 euros per person if you only order entrees. My wife and I consumed our meal family buffet style, which this restaurant is really made for.If you're timid and may be concerned about ordering authentic Chinese, there is no need to be here. The menu is spelled out in a few languages, including English, and every dish also has its picture next to it. Better yet, the food that comes out actually looks like the picture! They have the typical Chinese dishes (i.e.  sweet and sour chicken) for you to fall back on if cat tongue or whatever (they don't actually serve cat tongue... On the menu anyways. If they did I would consider getting it because everything looks delicious) doesn't quite do it for your palette. We had the sweet and sour chicken as well as the double fried pork, both of which were great. It was nice to be able to flip back and forth between a sweet and a savory dish. Most items like our chicken or pork also come with white rice. There are other options in back of the menu (noodles, fried rice) that are served as a stand alone dish. The service was quick, something I haven't experienced in Europe yet either. They have a more secluded section then another section that houses a ~60 inch TV. They adjusted the volume according to our preference and we watched Mulan a couple of times. Just kidding, it was some soccer match. Although I didn't receive a fortune cookie to tell me that sunshine is a ray of hope or that new friends are just around the corner, I was impressed enough to creep out of the bowels of my dark hole, break the silence, share my feelings, cover myself with feathers, lead the parade, and wave the flag for Lao Xiang."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,9/22/17,We enjoyed the cold wood ear salad/ fish congee/ pork buns/ cumin lamb. Cool atmosphere
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,6/28/17,"3* is for the nice staff.  Food really is disappointing.  Not quality ingredients & uses cheap substitutes.  Dishes came out different than in the menu pictures.  We have a Chinese speaking Chinese talking to the waitress & hoping the food we ordered will be ""for Chinese"".  Disappointed it came out still ""European"" Chinese food.  Using the wrong ingredients just didn't bring the right tastes.  Staff is nice, presentation of the food is nice.  But I wish it had more good taste than looks."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/14/16,"Do try the double fried pork, it's slightly spicy and amazing. Its not like anything you've tried before!Of course if you feel like eating chicken or frog legs, oyster or octopus Lao Xiang is the place for all of them.The place is quite big, has even a private golden room and the service is nice."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/29/15,"to be honest, Chinese food is not my most favourite cuisine but I simply love this restaurant. I fell in love with their visually magnificent menu cards. and the food is terrific. I'm so lucky it's right next to the corner of my flat that I could come as much as I want."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/23/14,Great authentic Chinese food. Also try the hotpot which is actually not on the menu. Random funny note: The Xi'an warrior near to the bathroom is holding a Germany flag - not sure why.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,3/22/14,"I love this place, definitely he most authentic Chinese in Berlin. Have the feuertopf which is not on the menu (ask for it), it is great for a few friends and great value. The dumplings are some of the best I have tried. Menu might seem expensive bit courses are about sharing then having on your own."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/3/14,Really good Chinese hot pot!! Other things on the menu looked good too but were a bit pricy. Awesome place to eat at on a cold day and they have wifi!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/18/13,"Truly authentic Chinese food, with Hunan focus. Very reasonably priced and nice atmosphere. In summertime also relaxed seating outside."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,1/5/14,We had a great experience in this place located next to the train station in Prenzlauer Berg. The prices are quite inexpensive. Service is very attentive and dedicated. Portions are quite big. Food is quite tasty and the menu is quiet big. Maybe not the most authentic Chinese food that you can find but certainly a good value for your buck.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/24/13,"Well, I don't know what authentic Chinese food is, because I've never been to China, but this was really fantastic. We ordered two main courses, which turned out to be A LOT of food, and I think it's common for people to share a main course and get a starter. But I am so happy to have a really good restaurant in the neighborhood finally.I want to try most of the things on the menu, and some of them are a bit scary for Western palates (chicken feet and frog meat included) but in the end we just had a beef stew and a lamb thing that we finished.I look forward to eating there many more times in the future."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/11/13,Actually address is Wichartstrasse 43. Fantastic family-run Chinese restaurant from south China. Excellent authentic food reasonably priced. One of my really regular places. I am eating thru the ENTIRE menu!!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,8/14/13,Mit dem Lao Xiang hat sich endlich ein authentisches Chinarestaurant in den Pberg gewagt und ich hoffe es wird belohnt. Sehr leckeres Essen jenseits von Ente S??-Sauer oder H?hnchen mit Reis. Wir hatten als Vorpeise die Jiaozi (mit Schwein gef?llte Teigtaschen) und als Hauptgerichte das doppelt gebackene Schweinefleisch und den Tofu mit Schweine- und Rindfleisch. Alles war sehr lecker und in anst?ndigen Portionen! Hungrig geht hier also niemand raus :-) Preis-Leistungs-Verh?ltnis ist auch sehr in Ordnung inkl. netter Bedienung. Den einen Punkt Abzug gibt es nur f?r das etwas kalte und minimalistische Ambiente im Restaurant. Alles in allem: absolute Empfehlung!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/25/13,"Searching for a new restaurant for tonight, we found this one and tried it the first time. Interior is modern and nice. The menu offers lots of authentic dishes and the photos shown are quite close to what you get. The choice of dishes is a bit wider than other chinese restaurants, most of them being hunan style. We tried a lot and it was very good compared to other chinese restaurants in Berlin. The spicy cucumber has a great unique taste, and all dishes came in their original hot and spicy taste. They even had very yummy durian fruit desserts. Service was very friendly and fast, just the boss hasn't been so friendly, but just showed up once. So with really nice food and service, also reasonable price, we enjoyed the evening a lot. This one is in the top league for Berlin. Now we tried it some more times and enjoyed the same nice experience. We will come back to try more Definitely worth a try for all who are missing chinese/sichuan/hunan food here and are too lazy to cook at home."
GOJI,Chinese,5,Under ?10,5,10/24/17,"We stumbled upon this small restaurant and were glad we did. David, the owner, explained his background (HongKong, Germany, science) and his love for Cantonese cuisine. He guided us through the varied menu and we enjoyed each of the four dishes we shared at the table. The portions were generous and the food delicious."
GOJI,Chinese,5,Under ?10,5,9/9/17,"Stopped in during a trip to Berlin. It's a little bit off the beaten path but well worth the short walk. Great, friendly service (spoke English). Definitely try the dim sum. Waiter was great and gave tips on what to order.  Very comfortable restaurant with great food. Would definitely recommend."
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,4,6/9/17,"Very good food, reasonably price! The restaurant is very popular, you should better have a reservation in advance !"
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,2,6/15/17,"Two stars for the 5 stars food; -5 stars for the really poor service.A lot of people had recommended me this place and I was very much looking forward to try it.First things first: don't come here without reservation. If you do, it's likely that you will be turned down because the place is full (it happened to me twice). Third attempt without reservation and we did get a table in the back. This speaks very well of the restaurant and the food, I thought. But to be honest, the place is packed and there is only one person serving all guests. It can take up to 15 minutes to order anything.When the food came, I noticed that all dishes had meat inside, but I am a vegetarian and had ordered tofu. It can happen, hectic kitchen, wrong orders. I went to the counter to tell the waitress, but she spent 15 more minutes attending people before we could speak. When I told her that the order was wrong, she insisted it was our fault and that we had only ordered meat. After some time talking, she said she would take the food back, remove the meat, and give me the same dish with tofu inside. I find this answer under all points of views unacceptable. Even if the waitress is inexperienced (it didn't seem to be the case, but the answer was), it's totally unacceptable. After a longer discussion, she went inside, discussed 15 minutes with the chef and decided to replace the dish for a new one. Should I feel lucky?!The food was really excellent, but I don't think I am coming back again and I don't think I will be recommending the place to anyone I know."
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/31/15,I have been here a few times and I really love that restaurant. It's authentic Korean food and since Arirang moved from Seestrasse in Weeding which was amazing but more like a Imbiss this is the best choice. I've eaten there from simple meals to places for few and enjoy it a lot. The service there is kind even that it sometimes seems that they don't get everything that you talking.. But this doesn't matter if you get out have while having a great lunch/dinner.
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,3,4/10/16,"decent. much better than 99.9% of the other options around. staff were very friendly, atmosphere is great.closed till end of April 2016, fyi."
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/30/16,Literally stumbled into this place when I had been dreaming about Korean for awhile... The teriyaki tofu is the best!! I think every main course comes with a little appetizer plate too. The place is really charming and cozy - soo sad it's closed until the end of the summer :(
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/4/15,"Meh. Nice spot. Very cute and friendly guy working there. Ordered bibimbap in the stone bowl and my friend had the fried chicken. Chicken was pretty good, crispy, but had way too much sauce. My bibimbap was tasty, but it was WAY too greasy. Vegetables could have been a little more abundant and a bit fresher. Banchan was lacking :\ but also really greasy. Kind of pricey for the quality. I'd come back here."
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/25/13,Walked into this place a bit unsure. My sort of restaurant. Strange with awesome food. I'd definitely go back. The only problem is I only speak English so this made it a bit hard to order. But that's my fault.
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/28/11,I'm a fan. BIG fan.
Korea Haus,Korean,4,?11-20,1,2/5/13,"first of all, i'm korean so i should know what it's supposed to be like sorry but it was the worst korean food i've ever had in my life! the pancake was ridiculously thick and flavorless, the bulgogi sauce was extremely sweet, stir fried squid dish was more like miserable pieces of squid flooded with sauce and soft tofu stew had no flavor and used the wrong kind of tofu! just because it looks cute and korean, doesn't mean it's authentic, people!"
Green Flavor,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/31/17,Good service and even better food. I had the wontons in chili oil to start. And then the noodles with pork and shrimp and vegetables. Was fantastic.
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,3/20/15,Simple beautiful interior. Cheap and good food. Home made lemon drink is highly recommended! ! Will come back! !
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,1,12/26/16,"I ordered a delivery from them and waited 1.5 hours. Wasn't able to reach them on the phone. At the end came a guy and I gave him some bills, he claimed he doesn't have change (who sends a delivery guy with no change???)  And wanted to take the rest for himself.At the end it wasn't even the dish I ordered. NEVER AGAIN."
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,9/1/16,"Prices were fantastic. But, this wasn't authentic Thai food and we waited 45 minutes for our food when the restaurant wasn't even busy. The food was just eh. Edible but I wouldn't come back."
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,1,3/25/16,"delivery was fast but.... the meat was terrible quality if you are lucky enough to find it in your plate.I ordered a red curry duck and could hardly find the meat inside and i am not sure it was  duck meat to be honest.the spring rolls looked from frozen definitely not homemade.the chicken plate my friend had was tasting like plasticnot recommended"
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,5/22/14,"Very good, inexpensive food with friendly staff who can speak English.  I highly recommend the crispy chicken."
Thai Curry,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,10/27/08,"i have to respectfully disagree with wonderwoman's review. i had a chicken red curry dish which was, for a place named after curry, remarkably average. i will say that the vegetables were a bit fresher than other low-priced thai eateries like le coq d'orthe establishment seems to pride themselves on always using fresh vegetables and even puts the ingredients they use in the front display case, however the green beens i saw seemed to display something that looked a lot like freezer burn on them. the chicken quality was the same rubbery stuff that i get in most other asian establishments. their dishes are also a bit smaller with less rice. i still plan to return, but i will probably keep my choices to vegetarian options. one last note: i came here last week at 10:30 and was told that i could only order takeout even though there were people eating inside and the menu they gave me said they closed at 11:30. they must be doing well for a place that just opened to turn down my business like that."
Con Tho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/5/17,One of the best restaurant in Berlin. The food is always great also the drinks. Best place ever
Con Tho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/16/17,"the food was good, the garden is very nice and the interior inside is very pretty too. the menu is a bit poorly designed but the food makes up for this little flaw.i tried the yellow sunshine, for the crepes you have to wait longer so they recommend to get some appetizers - the portion of the starters were rather small. we had the mushroom, the poree and the tofu. i'd recommend the poree! the crepe is fun to make and filling too.definitely go for the choco mousse at the end - its very heavy but amazing!service was ok., they were super busy on friday night and not that well organised. average berlin."
Con Tho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/24/17,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Berlin. So much excellent veg food! The homemade shakes and sodas are awesome (all of them). My favorite food on the menu are the rice bowls. The seasoned seitan is probably the best I've ever had. Great ambiance as well. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, and with the tall, beautifully lit stalks of bamboo in the outdoor seating area, you can easily forget that you're right on busy Hasenheide. I almost hesitate to write this review because I want to have this place all to myself, but it's an excellent new restaurant and they deserve all the attention they can get. Highly recommended."
Con Tho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/16/17,"WOW - the best asian food i had in berlin. hands down! highest quality of dishes, super creative, amazing service and extremely pretty interior! highly recommended"
Mr. Hoang,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/21/16,"My first time visit last night will definitely not be my last. The vegetarian spring rolls were good and my  main dish super delicious. I had No. 56 and loved(!) the mango coconut combination. Service and ambience were nice, just like my company but I guess that doesn't count towards the rating :) Anyway, recommendable stop for vegans in Wedding right next to the S-Bahn station. 2 thumbs up and definitely #VeganVentures approved!"
Mr. Hoang,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,9/29/17,"Good food. Good service. Will definitely come again!I had the udon noodle dish and a ginger lemon cold tee; superb. The outside area is especially cosy."
Mr. Hoang,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,8/23/16,"The Vietnamese spring role was ok..rather bland (not enough herbs), but the tofu yellow curry with taro was very good. The mix of tofu soaked with delicious curry sauce with crisp mint and herbs fused nicely. I sensed there was sugar in the sauce, but many people like that. Mango lassi was good made fresh to order."
Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,2/21/13,My favorite Thai near Frankfurter Allee. Delicious and fresh food for a small price.
Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,11/10/15,"Stopped by Thai Snack tonight before we head home from Frankfurter Allee. The place is tiny and it is mostly a take-away food place with only 3 tables inside. We ordered two small bowls of Tom Yum soup, green curry with chicken and green pepper chicken. The green curry was pretty tasty but the green pepper was just mediocre. We walked out the door satisfied, but super thirsty. I have had 4 glasses of water in 2 hours since, and I am still thirsty. There might just be copious amount of MSG in the dishes. Just may be? :P"
Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,6/21/15,"This place is surprisingly - maybe even shockingly - good!  I overlooked it for months, thinking it was a run-of-the-mill Asia imbiss.  Turns out it is actually tasty Thai food for super cheap!The menu (available in German & English) is quite large but is mostly Thai favorites.  I am always happier when a restaurant sticks to one type of food, unlike the many many Viet/Thai/sushi places in Berlin that are just awful.  Thai Snack is like a breath of fresh air!The food is still greasy take-away, but at about ?5 per entree who's complaining?  The location, right across from the Frankfurter Allee station, is super convenient.  Definitely stop in Thai Snack if you're looking for a quick & cheap meal on FF Allee."
Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,3/26/13,Good food! Never disappoints.
Mai Phai,Thai,4,?11-20,5,2/21/12,"Best Thai Food in Berlin Steglitz, fresh and very tasty!"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4,Under ?10,5,5/24/17,"This food is delicious! Never heard of such a place before, but was simply walking by as I had to wait an hour for my appointment at the Zullasungstelle down the street. Walked in, met a very friendly staff that recommended me the Beef dumplings, and I also ordered the pumpkin/pea dumplings. I'm literally just through the pumpkin/pea dumplings right now and realized I had to write in Yelp asap about these guys. In the picture is the beef dumplings only (b9 on the menu I believe) as I was starving and chomped on the pumpkin/pea set immediately. Highly recommended and I'll be back here even without an appointment at the Zulassungstelle! :-)"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4,Under ?10,4,8/27/17,"Set in a beautiful part of the Kreuzberg area called Bergmannkiez, this neighborhood eatery provides delicious dumplings and relaxing atmosphere. Whether you decide to sit outside on the street and watch the passers by or inside, you'll surely enjoy anyone of Cha for Tee's broad menu of meat-filled and vegetarian dumplings.I went with an appetizer of pork wanton soup, which really hit the spot. Later, I hit the pork dumplings with cabbage and coriander. It was quite good--not the best dumplings I've ever had--but definitely satisfying enough and well worth the price.But the real piece de resistance of the joint is the desert. I got the pastry dumplings (set of two) which came I are with coffee out on the street-side tables.All and all, it was a perfect way to spend a late Sunday afternoon."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4,Under ?10,4,10/17/17,"The place is in a very cute area~there are many different kinds of dumplings here, and they are colorful! Good dumplings!"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4,Under ?10,3,7/26/17,"If you are craving dumplings or some semblance of Chinese food, this place is fine. They have a homemade chili oil sauce that I liked. The dan dan mian was tasty, but it lacked the boldness that I am used to. Xiao long bao was a disappointment --flavor was decent, but most of my soup dumplings didn't have soup. Ma la ro was acceptable.If this is your only option for Chinese, you'll be fine. Good service, nice ambiance and plenty of seating on a quiet street near templehof. It was a very pleasant experience nonetheless. CASH ONLY."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4,Under ?10,5,11/7/16,"This place is so cute. And super tasty. We tried the green bean appetizer and several of the vegetarian and pork dumplings. All are highly recommended- especially the green beans. The tea selection was crazy. The only draw-back was that the dumplings take a while to steam. We ordered another round after our first and then one more for dessert and ended up staying quite a while, even for European standards. But the atmosphere is nice so no real complaints here!"
Seoul-Kwan,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,11/29/17,"Wow! I was craving some Korean food after a long day of sightseeing and asked around for a good Korean eatery. Locals pointed me to this gem, which was super easy to reach by public transportation, too. We had the Kimchi Jigae, which totally hit the spot! Highly recommended!!!"
Seoul-Kwan,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,8/12/14,"When a companion who lives in Potsdam told me that we haven't met each other in a long time, I proposed dinner. Her one constraint was that it should be near the S-Bahn line to Potsdam, so I went ahead and tried finding good places near. I found this one, walkable from S-Bhf Friedenau. As both of us haven't been to this place before, we didn't know what to expect.We said we would go at 18:00, and since the restaurant opens at 18:00, we were the first ones there. The interior doesn't look swanky nor glamorous at all; to be honest, I had doubts what kinds of restaurant it might be. In other words, the interior doesn't look appetizing.However, we still went ahead, and ordered a small fried mandu appetizer, as well as a So Bulgogi (their Bulgogis -those menu items grilled on the table- are only possible for two or more people, so order these only when you have company). They pre-cooked it at a separate table, and when it was about to be done, they moved it to our table. Oh gosh, it was so good. The meat was very tasty and delicious. I would definitely come back here again, and with other companions, so that we can try the other bulgogi items. Not to say that this restaurant doesn't cater to single diners; they also have plenty of menu items that don't need a minimum of two people to order, but it seems that bulgogi is something that this restaurant definitely does well.One thing that intrigued me was the menu items #400 and above. There is a dedicated page to them in the menu, but they were only in Korean, with no German translation provided. I asked the staff what they were, and she explained. I also asked why there were no German translations provided, and she said that they are very hot Korean dishes, and she claimed that even she couldn't eat them. But those items were eel, tuna, and other exotic-sounding things. So that might be something I'd want to order next time. The price definitely reflects their exotic nature.Overall, this was a good find. The appearance of this restaurant is not the most appealing, and it is located in a place that isn't the most touristy, but oh my, the food is just heavenly. Promise yourself you'll exercise the morning after."
Seoul-Kwan,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,6/13/15,"I'm a little surprised to be saying this, but this was straight up legit Korean in Berlin. However, if you try to order in Korean you will get a blank stare from the young Korean-German server. Oh, well, part of my fun was ruined, but this place was still great. Basically they had my favorite dishes, the most drinkable of all the crappy Korean beers in existence (Sorry, Korea, but your beer is shit.), and soju! Way overpriced soju at 14?, which is about 13? more than it's worth in Korea. I still got some for nostalgia's sake. The banchan are pretty standard ones, but still good. All the kimchi! The sundubu jiggae was nomtastic, even if it was too warm for a boiling bowl of stew. My friend, who was having Korean for the first time, loved everything from her bibimbap to the soju. Success!"
Seoul-Kwan,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,3/30/16,"I have known the Seoul Kwan for several years. When I came here in 2012, I was very surprised about the quality of the food and the lovely service. Back then many Koreans used to eat here, which is always a good sign for the authencity of the dishes. However when I came here two months ago, I was a bit disappointed. The whole restaurant was really empty around dinner time, we were the only guests. But the very young Korean waitress was really well-coming and friendly. We ordered mandu and bulgogi. The portions are generous and filling. The mandu, I did not like, unfortunately. It had too much dough and the stuffing was not convincing, it needed some more herbs and flavour. The bulgogi was okay, but I have eaten better bulgogi in Berlin. The various side dishes, they served I enjoyed a lot.Compared to other Korean restaurants in Berlin,  the prices are middle ranged, not cheap but not expensive either considering the portion they serve. Overall, the food was alright. It was much better when I visit this place in 2012 so I went home a little bit disappointed."
Seoul-Kwan,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,8/15/14,"One of the best Koreans in Berlin. Banchan are very good and diverse. The Ginger tea is awesome -- highly recommend it. And the soups and dishes are very good as well. Good place to take someone who isn't as accustomed to eating ""ethnic"" food as they also have non-spicy options such as a Chicken Sweat & Sour dish.Also a good place to go if you are a larger group as they can easily accommodate you.And yes they take credit cards (that this even has to be mentioned is a reflection of the sad state of affairs in Berlin when it comes to electronic payments) which is why I tend to take large groups there on business. UPDATE: The last time they weren't quite so easy to deal with in terms of paying with a card. So bring cash as a backup."
Tonsai Thai-Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,3/25/15,"Best Thai restaurant in Berlin. Very tasty food. Going there once a month since several years. Bestes Thai Restaurant in Berlin. Essen ist immer spitze und schmeckt. Bedienung ist sehr freundlich ( Thai style eben). Ich gehe mindestens einmal im Monat seit mehreren Jahren dort essen."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/22/17,We got the chicken bulgogi grill which was very good. It is meant for 2. The sides were so tasty; we asked for more of the potato/carrot pickle. Excellent meal and good service.
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/30/17,"The place is on the smaller side. There are no built in grills so they use a portable gas stove with a grill plate which is okay. Although there are no air vents so it does get a little smokey depending on what type of meat you or your neighbors get. There were 6 Korean side dishes with rice that came with our meal. Lettuce, soy bean paste, and oil salt dip as well.  We got the pork grill plate for two. There is traditional seating in the back which was cool to see. They show you how to grill the meat and prepare it a bit when it is done as well. They were a little busy so service had a slow start but they were attentive once the food got there. Der Ort ist auf der kleineren Seite. Es gibt keine eingebauten Grills, also verwenden sie einen tragbaren Gasherd mit einer Grillplatte, die in Ordnung ist. Obwohl es keine L?ftungsschlitze gibt, wird es ein wenig rauchig, je nachdem, welche Art von Fleisch Sie oder Ihre Nachbarn bekommen. Es gab 6 koreanische Beilagen mit Reis, die mit unserer Mahlzeit kamen. Salat, Sojabohnenpaste und ?lsalz tauchen ebenfalls auf. Wir haben die Schweinegrillplatte f?r zwei Personen bekommen. Es gibt traditionelle Sitzgelegenheiten auf der R?ckseite, was cool zu sehen war. Sie zeigen dir, wie du das Fleisch grillen kannst und bereitest es ein bisschen zu, wenn es auch fertig ist. Sie waren etwas besch?ftigt, so dass der Service einen langsamen Start hatte, aber sie waren aufmerksam, sobald das Essen dort ankam."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/22/17,Delicious!!!! Wonderful food! A must try! They also have floor seating as an option. Make a reservation!
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,1/22/17,"We came here with my friends for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. Madang is definitely one of those ""nicer"" looking Korean restaurants (I've been to a lot of dingy ones in Toronto). We were seated in the front, and service was great.I got myself the kimchi chigae, since it was super cold that evening. No doubt, it was super good. My friends all got themselves the dolsot bibimbap, and they said it was good as well. However, the only complaints that I have are 1) it's a bit expensive for Korean food; 2) they don't serve the typical ban chans that you would get at a traditional Korean restaurant. My meal only came with three, and it was kind of disappointing.Otherwise, great Korean food -- comparable to those in Toronto - just for a steeper price."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,8/2/16,"The quality of the food is good but it's slightly pricey for what it's worth. My friend and I ordered the classic bibimbap and seafood sundubu (soft tofu soup). We also got makgeoli so we spent a good amount of money (I think ~?18 each). The soft tofu soup was quite good, as was the bibimbap. I don't know if I'll return because I would rather explore other places that may be cheaper. Also, they give a couple banchan with the main dishes but you can also order the banchan separately. It's weird because I don't ever think banchan should cost money!!!!! That is a rule in Korea. Come on now!!!!"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,3,6/8/16,"It took me two visits to come up with an opinion about this place. It is very original and the food there is also quite unique. Though in my opinion unique does not mean very good. It is ok-isch.Starters were very small and had little taste. The main dish - grill plate, was big enough for two people, accompanied by various side dishes. And again, I was expecting much more taste. It was plain. We did not touch the desserts as the selection was very limited.So all in all I am not a fan of this place. I would describe it with one sentence, taking into account all the cooking that takes place in front of your eyes: much a do about nothing""..."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/4/15,"Oh how I missed Asian food... I was tired of Portugal's one kind of cuisine and decided my trip to Berlin was going to be my chance for tasty ethnic foods. I had a mediocre Thai food experience on my first night which made me wary of Berlin Asian food but Madang was the real deal!I wished my bf was with me so we could have ordered the bbq but, since I was alone I ordered the beef bibimbop and a Korean pancake. It was delicious! The bibimbop was sizzling and spicy, the egg was runny, and there was a nice crunchy crust to the rice. Even the side dishes were prepared with care--the kimchee was perfectly spicy and the fermented beans (which I usually skip because the flavor is overpowering) were much better than normal. The service was nice and friendly and they have English menus. I only have one complaint about the whole meal. I ordered the pancake because I was starving. So I thought they would bring it out as an appetizer rather than with my bibimbop. But this was a small oversight."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/8/17,"Amazing food, and seem like people know it because it was pretty full for dinner.There are 5 types of bbq and the vegan one is amazing. So are all the different teas.We waited 15-20 min to be seated but it was worth it, because the food is genuinely great.The service is also beyond anything I got used to in Berlin, the staff is attentive and offered some nice deserts in the end."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,8/26/17,"Craving Korean food after a few weeks around Europe. Sat outside on cool summer night and people-watched as we waited for our food. Sundubu hit the spot- hot, spicy, and soft tofu, tasted a bit like ramen broth hah; husband's spicy chicken dish wasn't too bad either. Also got a kimchi cheese jeon, a bit salty but not bad. Portions were a bit on the smaller side, and came with 2-3 side dishes per meal. First Korean meal in Berlin so cannot accurately compare price/portions, so will say decent overall!"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,3,2/27/17,"An authentic Korean food. If you want to try real kimchi, go there! Food is nice but definitely too expensive."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,12/6/13,"I have a goal to bring my companion to a new restaurant every time we eat out and it is my choice to pick a restaurant, so we ended up here for last night. It was a late dinner; we showed up at about 21:15, and I was surprised that the place was still packed. We unfortunately did not have a reservation, so we had to wait about five minutes before a table opened up.I ordered the Jeonji Dolsot Bibimbap, while my companion ordered the seafood stew set (I forgot the name). We also shared an order of the dumpling appetizers (V5): these are four small delicate dumplings filled with Korean goodness, dipped in delicate dipping sauce. Oh, we also shared a pot of green tea.I was impressed with this place. The food was amazing. The bibimbap was perfect: I mixed it with the spicy sauce provided on my tray, and mixed it all over inside the hot stone. The rice was well-done, and the vegetables and meat were fresh. The delicate seaweed soup that came with it also had a very exquisite flavor that I would want to order it for that soup alone. Needless to say, judging from how my companion looked that night, he also enjoyed his meal.The restaurant is small; there's not a lot of wiggle room in it. Make a reservation if you are a group bigger than two people. As we were leaving around 22:00, people were still coming in and sitting down. The restrooms are downstairs; they are very clean and cavernous, although they should clear the trash bins every now and then.Overall, a great find. I give this place 5 stars and will definitely come back here again."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/20/14,"I wanted to find a good Asian restaurant in the area as we were off to an English Comedy event nearby and as it was by bf's birthday I also didn't want to eat the standard Asian fare that is usually on offer. I went by a few days beforehand to check it out but it was closed but luckily they had a menu outside so based solely on what was described I thought okay this sounds good, let's hope it is! I phoned and made a reservation good job too! We arrived at 18:30, it was empty but every single table was reserved and by 19:00 it was full. Not sure how it is on weekdays but I would definitely recommend that you make a reservation anyway!I have to say it exceeded my expectations! The staff are very polite and efficient... And the food, that was just simply delicious!We were four people sharing 2 starters & 2 mains:S1:  Madang Gimbab. ?4, 50 gets you 10 pieces of seaweed to fill with a choice of rice, beef, vegetables and thinly sliced egg roll. S2:  Chiljeonpan. 4 mini pancakes for ?3, 50 with a very tasty mustard dipping .M1:  Dakgalbi (Hotpot #T5) Sooooooo good!!! Tender pieces of chicken and vegetables come in a spicy broth which are then chopped and mixed up for you at the table. When it's all prepared it takes on a thick stew consistency. Just writing about it is making me dream about having it again!M2: Samgyopsal, a table grilling dish consisting of Sliced of pork belly grilled then wrapped in Lettuce leaves.All this was complimented by a selection of Banchan (side dishes) like: Kimchi, beans in soya sauce, pickled and marinated vegetables, moo-chae (radish) and Ssamjang paste.For dessert we had Yakgwa (a very traditional dessert that was once considered a medicinal confection make from honey, sesame oil and wheat flour) and Chapssalduk (mochi style rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste).To round off our meal we were given complimentary apple slices and the birthday boy got a shot of Soju!This has to be one of the most satisfying and excellent Korean meals I have ever had...to date! Must go back soon and try out some of the other offerings.If you have never tried Korean food before I would recommend coming here. Most impressive for such a small and unassuming establishment.Oh if you are thinking of a romantic or private t?te-?-t?te with your partner you should be warned that with the table grill dishes the staff prepare it for you and will stay there until all the meat is cooked! Probably because they come on little stoves and not set into tables like in other places :)"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,3,8/12/15,Food was 3-4 stars but service was 3. Great place to take someone to try Korean food but would not be the greatest for someone experienced with Korean cuisine.
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,7/6/11,"I had such a fine dining experience here, that I did not want to wait to write a review. DISCLAIMER: this review will probably sound biased because 1) I'm Asian, and 2) I have not had Asian food, rice or vegetables since I left LA three weeks ago. Also, this might be a long review because I am STILL pleased with my experience tonight.Okay, so I have been craving rice and vegetables since I got to Europe three weeks ago. Sushi just was not cutting it for me, and I spent long hours searching up what restaurants seemed good, and coordinated it with my work schedule (I currently work in Potsdam, quite a commute!). I ran upon Madang while I was on Yelp and looking at yamyam instead.Madang seemed really close to my apartment in Tempelhof, so I decided today to go try it out. At first, I was really nervous because I have been pretty disappointed with the Vietnamese restaurants here in the past, that I did not want to be disappointed with Korean food, one of my favourite cuisines.When I got off the U-Bahn and found Madang, I was relieved to see it was owned by Korean people, and that there were Asian people eating -- VERY good sign! I decided to walk in and dine inside. I was greeted by a lady wearing a traditional Korean outfit, which I thought was pretty cool with the decor too. I ordered the bibimbap, and it was a hot day so I did not want it in the hot stone pot with the egg, but the lady convinced me anyway, so I did.When it came out, I was expecting it to be burning hot, like back in California, but it actually was hot enough for the egg to cook but cool enough for me to start digging in immediately! It also came with seaweed soup, beans and hot sauce.The bibimbap is definitely NOT the best nor close to California quality, but because I have little expectations in Berlin, I was satisfied! It could have used more meat though... I also did not think the hot sauce was hot enough...I put the whole thing in there, barely tasted spice. I guess I will ask for more next time. The seaweed soup was good, I avoided the beans, and the kimchi was...alright, kind of like kimchi you get at some ramen places.Anyway, if this was in California, I would give it 2.5 stars, but because I'm in Berlin AND because the servers were so nice (even let me take pictures of my stuffed blue fly inside and complimented it!), I will give this place four stars. They made me feel secure eating by myself too, haha. And I also got watermelon after my bill! Yay! (:"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/4/15,"Had the grilled plate for 3 people with a million side dishes and pre-course and everything was fantastic!Will be there soon!"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,9/11/15,"Nice small place. Make sure to do reservation, its usually fully booked. Service is nice (guess they're all a big family). I tried anju (pork ribs) and gambibi, it was good. Most of the menu is for at least two (bulgogi :( sadly). So I think it's better for groups. But I would suggest Tibetean restaurant next door for couples. Good koren food, but nothing mind blowing."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,8/27/15,"When a bunch of friends and I went, the restaurant was quite empty which is good cause that meant no wait! The service was good, but the food could have been better. My dish (the soondubu) was really salty and I thought it was kind of ridiculous that they made you pay for the side dishes... which I thought were standard to be free in all korean restaurants!"
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/2/15,"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Despite a language barrier, my girlfriend and I had the most delicious dim sum, beef bibimbap, and some kind of spicy sweet noodles (N2). The noodles contained seafood, which made me weary at first, but they did not even have the slightest hint of fishiness. This place is seriously so good. The server was friendly and very accommodating. I don't think you can go wrong here. The noodles were so good!!! The beans and Kim chi were the best I have ever had by far. Go here if you have the chance. You won't regret it."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/15/15,"We're in Berlin for a month on vacation and plan to eat here at least 3-4 times a week.   It's absolutely fantastic.  We got the Daeji Bulgogi and wow- it's sooooo good.   Other than wishing for a slightly better beer menu, we can't think of anything we'd change."
Madang,Korean,4,?11-20,4,1/28/13,"Great find for Korean food in Kreuzberg!  I recommend sitting in the back at one of the two low-sitting tables (raised platform, no shoes, sitting on the ground, but the cushions have enough support to keep you upright) for extra privacy, plus the front dining room felt a little drafty when we stopped by on a chilly night.Food was great, and prices very reasonable -- very diverse mix of grilled meats and other Korean standards.  The banchan, especially the appropriately spicy kim chi, were good, but I would have liked to see a little more variety.  Service was very nice and helpful.  We arrived before 7 on a Friday and were probably the last table to get in without a reservation, so plan ahead.  Withholding a fifth star due to the lack of in-table grills -- the portable grills used at Madang and elsewhere are no substitute for an experience with a larger grills built into your table.  Still looking for those in Berlin!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,11/22/17,"Still my all-time favourite Chinese food. The interior is modern but maintains a cozy, chinese-cantina kid of feel. The service is very friendly and speaks English (which is normal nowadays I know but I thought I?d mention it). The food is delicious everytime and ranges from honey spare rips to soft summer rolls. My personal favourites here however are the dumplings (because I like the word and also they taste great). They are traditional Chinese dumplings with a gourmet twist ( whitechicken or orangeprawns or blackbeef whatever you want) so you can`t go wrong. Anyway I?m heading there now because I got hungry writing this review, bye !"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,4/24/17,"I walked past this place a few times already and I always thought it looked neat. Now that I have been inside I know that the appearance did not fool me. :-PThe service was really friendly and every single dish we tried was amazing! Obviously you have to try any variety of their dumplings when you are here! :-)"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,9/11/17,"Come early to grab a seat.  This small little place has a great little cozy atmosphere, but even more important are the amazing dumplings.  We enjoyed the pork steamed dumplings and in fact placed a second order because they were too delicious to share.  The rest of the food we ordered like the peking pork was good, but nothing to write home about so that is why I only gave 4 stars.  Also the service was not the best.  They were friendly but rushed and had to flag them down several times to place an order for food and drinks."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,3,7/1/17,"Overhyped and overpriced. The dumplings were okay, but nothing to write home about. The salmon was a disaster- overcooked, huge chunks of rock salt, underwhelming sauce and really for 8.50? it should have been at least twice the size. The best part of my 20? lunch was the house made lemonade, which was actually more of a light limeade spritz."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,7/8/17,"Quite yummy dumplings and cucumber slices salad! Came here for lunch with my meat-eating friends, not knowing if there would be anything for me. Luckily, I was happily surprised with delicious veggie dumplings. Sat outside with my puppy and enjoyed the view!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,10/13/17,Best Yumcha ever!! Get the baked Spring rolls. Quick friendly service. Excellent English but you must book! Saw so many people get turned away because every table was booked and it's only a small restaurant.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,7/8/16,"The dumplings were really amazing. My friends and I were feeling adventurous so we ordered many different kinds of dumplings. My personal favorite was the pink lamb. But I also loved the black beef and the orange prawn. They were super flavorful. The dumplings are big and very filled. Fat fat dumplings!! Just what I like. But the baked ones (which are fried) are kinda small.I say skip the Shanghai dumplings -- no soup in a xiao long bao?! You may fool these Berliners but you can't fool me! I was Chinese in my past life. It's affordable but I kind of wish the dumplings were slightly cheaper so I could eat more of them!! For 10 euros you can eat 6 dumplings if you share with friends. I would certainly go back!!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,11/9/15,"I came here on a recommendation from a co-worker and was not disappointed.  The place is small but exudes a coolness factor. Located a short walk from Rosenthaler Platz underground on a quiet street it's easy to miss if you don't walk far enough down the street. Just walk past the Salumi place and you'll see itI asked the waitress what amount of dumplings she recommended for 1 person. The waitress suggested I order 2 sets of dumplings so I tried the Prawn dumplings and the soup dumplings plus an order of edamame. The dumplings come in servings of 4 and are accompanied by 3 dipping sauces: a soy sauce-base one, a sweet one and a slightly spicier one. The Prawn dumplings were very good and the shrimp was not overcooked or mushy. The soup dumplings were very good too, however, they were not very soupy.  I would have preferred them with more broth inside the way they make them in New York's Chinatown. But the minced pork filling was flavorful. Two orders was definitely enough as I was stuffed so I am glad I didn't order more. They have a great selection of teas and juices here too. The service was quick and the waitress was friendly. Turns out she was from California so that explains the better than average service. I can't believe it took me this long to find this place. It ranks in my Top 10 and I will be coming back on my next work trip."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,3,6/19/16,"It' a small restaurant located at the conner on a street. The service was very nice and friendly. They greet us really well. Mother of dumpling was tasty, I really like it. Duck dumpling needs to change to beans dumpling because all I tasted was bean, just a little bit of duck meat inside. Beef Roll were to sour. 3 start for nice services and some good dumpling but others was not worth for its price."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,12/31/16,So good. Nothing else to add other than I wish I lived in Berlin so I could eat here everyday.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,8/12/16,"Those dumplings will make you think you just went to Chinese heaven.Start with the black beef soup - it's black dumplings dipped in a sweet/spicy aromatic soup, which tastes even better once it mixes with the fillings. Shanghai dumplings are a classic, try all three different sauces that come with them.For dessert, nougat dumplings work quite well - they come with delicious vanilla sauce!For a claustrophobic Hong Kong experience try visiting the restroom."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,8/14/15,"Fantastic dumplings and fresh juices.This restaurant is famous for they yummy dumplings. The rumour was correct: 5 star! We tired the vegetarian, orange shrimp and beef (rind). So much flavour, perfectly cooked. With this we drank four juices as they were hard not finish right away; DELICIOUS! (Only fruit!)Watermelon+lycheeCucumber, ginger, mintLychee, lime, soda Carrot, honey melon, honeyOn top of this super cute and friendly staff, good outdoor tables and a very cool toilet!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,3,12/21/16,"The food is okay, but feels a bit uninspired; you could say it looks better than it tastes. A restaurant whose main selling point is the ambience rather than the menu."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,11/1/16,"Good food, but great dumplings.  Friendly staff and a clean restaurant.  You'll leave with a happy belly. :)"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,3,5/18/16,"Maybe I'm spoilt by all the great Asian food we have in New Zealand, but the food we had was pretty ordinary. I think ""Asian fusion"" can sometimes be used to describe something that isn't authentic, or good.Prawn dumplings were ok, lamb dumplings were just a meatball wrapped in a thick pastry. It was ok, but not somewhere I would be raving to my friends about."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,4/16/16,"The place is very small so if you are more than two, you better get a reservation. Food is very good. Pretty fast and a lot of dishes. I would recommend to choose different combiantion and share them. Not all the Dumplings are the same size, even they are four per order. The menu comes in English for all of us who are not very fluent in German. Prices are not high and the service is very friendly specially for the host."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,8/4/14,"The dumplings are pretty good, but the servings are small. They always have a set menu for lunch special, and that was pretty good. They're not traditional Chinese dim sum, but I was intrigued and enjoyed the flavours for what it was. You probably will not fill yourself up here unless you're with friends, but the food is pretty good. It's hip and trendy, and there are tons of booths. I ate here alone, but they were still really accommodating to my needs.I ordered a dumpling set with the soup dumplings, which were delicious and one of my first forays into the soup dumpling world. I also ordered the winter dumplings which were rich and a bit sweet. To top off my dumpling set, it also came with a soup, which was pretty good. The menu is simple, mostly based around the dumplings/dim sum. For a fast, quick lunch with good value, I'd go to Yumcha Heroes for the set menu. It's a relatively light meal (I think only three or four come in a set,) but it's affordable and has space for a lot of people, especially if youw ant to share. I didn't order any alcohol with my meal, but I did order one of those blooming teas which looked beautiful in a high glass."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,1,9/30/15,"Waited 30min for dumplings! Dumpling itself was OK, however no spoon delivered for the soupUnfortunately also no dogs allowed in the place, also not very charming staff"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,4,7/24/12,"Yumcha Heroes! I mean, the name is just catchy, right? It is. Couple that with the kitschy little sign of two dumpling heroes high-fiving...and well, can you go wrong? You cannot. On a beautiful, gloriously sunny evening in Berlin I found myself perched just inside the patio at Yumcha awaiting my first Asian cuisine in Berlin aside from the sushi/Viet outpost in my supermarket.I was pumped. DUMPLINGS. Let's do this. The restaurant was comfortably full...the patio pleasantly plump with patrons. Tables turn relatively fast because the food is pushed out with a nice clip. Good for me, as I was famished after a day of soaking in sunshine (finally!). An Aperol Spritz (or two) found me as well as the Shu Mai dumplings (pork, serving size =4 for about 3 euro). I also ordered the Jacob's Chicken, which was good but in hindsight I would've rather had a plate of steamed veggies and MORE dumplings. The dumplings are where its at, I do highly recommend. The silk cube tofu was also a hit, but I think next time soup, dumplings, more dumplings, veggies. That shall be my winning combo. Service was good despite being full, and pretty friendly. I noticed they do take credit cards (not sure if its just German bank cards though), but I'd bring cash just in case. Three drinks (eeps, school night!) plus dumplings and a main entree set me back approximately 35 euro. Not the cheapest (though the dumplings are), what really hit the bill was the 16 euro chicken...which wasn't even close to my favorite thing. So, lesson: go get the dumplings. YUMCHA HEROES! High five! *ps pro-tip, skip their desserts and head across the street for ice cream."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,2,1/31/16,"I don't know what has changed, but the dumplings we had last night tasted awful. If I were to guess, they used leftovers from yesterday (or even days ago). The ""steamed"" shrimp dumplings looked just like the ""pan fried"" version - both were very greasy and the dumpling wrap/dough was very chewy. It also had a very foul stench.Months has gone by since we ate here and we liked the place, but we're no longer going to eat here. Seriously, there are a lot of other places popping up that's offering fresh, tasty, dim-sum."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/16/17,Authentic tasting and beautiful crafted Vietnamese food. Service is great and prices are super affordable. 5 stars from a Vietnamese foodie from America.
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/9/16,"Wow ... I have no idea whether the food here is authentic vietnamese or not becuz 1) i am not vietnamese 2) and I dont think i am qualified to judge that after my experience of 5-bowl of pho in my entire life. But the pho bo here was delicious! It is very cheap and you get a huge bowl of pho! The appetizer was summer roll for ?3.5 and it was very fresh and in generous porton.The restaurant is very clean and airy. The service is great. Plus it is very near the s+u bahn! If you come during lunch then you get ?1 offf the main dishes! :)"
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/3/16,"We were in the neighborhood for a happy hour event, and were looking for dinner options after the event.  Since it was Sunday night, many places were closed, but luckily this is one of the options still open and looked promising according to Yelp reviews.  Although the restaurant was small and relatively busy, the three of us managed to get a table right away.  As someone who has gone to many Vietnamese restaurants in the U.S., I was surprised to find that items on the menu did not look familiar to me.  The waiter was nice enough to recommend a few popular dishes, and I decided to try to duck with rice.  When the food was served I thought it looked like a pile of shredded lettuce with rice, and I was disappointed. However, upon further investigation as I worked through the meal, I realized there was a large quantity of flavorful duck pieces buried under the pile of veggies.  In fact, it was more than I was able to finish.  I'm still not sure if their dishes are traditional vietnamese. Based on presentation and flavor, it might be more contemporary/new age Asian fusion.  The prices were great, all of other dinner were under 10 euros each.  Delicious food and good value- best of both worlds."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,2,11/29/16,"Always fresh. Always polite. Not on my last two visits.  Friendly servers, actually rude Delicious food.  They will adapt dishes for smaller portions or less spicy for children or me. Ask for sauce and they bring a used half full tray of sauces from the table next to you.   I am editing this review and never goin"
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/22/16,It is not traditional Vietnamese but the flavor was good. Fusion chinese sauces in there. We had the specials of the day. Egg rolls (with rice paper not the usual kind) with sweet and sour sauce. Fried chicken legs in a sweet savory sauce. Followed by diced beef with rice and a salad on top. And the crispy duck on thick rice noodle with a coconut cream curry. The curry was a little too sweet but all the dishes had nice flavor. It was a good size place for even a family to sit. I would come again.
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,5/7/17,"I kind of like the vegetarian pho but it wasn't anything special. However the vegetarian dumplings were tasteless, I think they were made of tofu."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/16/16,"Pretty good pho (the ""o"" with the correct diacritics seems to be unsupported on here, but no matter) b?, even if the b?nh pho were slippier and not as chewy as I personally prefer. Not stingy with the meat or herbs, and the broth, the make-it-or-break-it of it all, was delicious. Portions are just the slightest smaller than I'm used to, but if it's any metric to go by, I'd bring my Vietnamese, living-in-Houston-so-we're-pretty-spoiled-on-the-*~ethnic~*-food-front parents here. The staff speak Vietnamese (and I'd be practically lying by omission if I didn't mention how strong their Northern accents were)."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/4/15,"Food was very tasty. The combination of herbs and spices was in a good proportion and matched perfectly.Unfortunately, paying with a credit card was not possible. Great ambience, well matching decoration and friendly staff.A cheap way to eat super tasty Asian food."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/6/16,Hands down best Pho Bo (pho with beef) in Berlin. The portions are ample with fresh ingredients and fragrant herbs. There's a great selection of homemade lemonades and fresh fruit juices to match.
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/1/15,Went there twice. Once in June 2014 and then again in February 2015. Pretty good food. They don't have a huge menu but whatever they have its pretty good. The first time we weren't that hungry so we ordered a bunch of small plates and shared. This time I had their special chicken dish with vegetables and lemongrass. Was nice and spicy! I've also had their pineapple mint shake which was delicious! Friend had their chilli and raspberry shake and said that it was quite spicy but yummy!
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/14/14,"A fantastic all round experience! Amazing, well balanced food which was enhanced by having a very helpful waiter who gave great menu suggestions. A lovely and relaxed environment and fantastic value. Highly recommended, a favourite place in Berlin!"
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/21/13,"Great taste, fair priced! Better than most Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Berlin."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/25/13,"friendly and quick servicegood quality and pricesgood atmosphere for lunchI enjoyed with my sister after a small shopping tour for a quick lunch.nice that you can sit inside with wide open doors too and feel like outside"
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/20/13,"Lying there, almost anonymously, behind the S-bahn  a small treasure. Very reasonably priced vietnamese style cuisine. The portions are big and there is af good authenticity about it. Flavours are wonderful !"
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/23/13,Total lecker! Vor allem schnell und preisgunstig.
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/23/10,"Really consistent Vietnamese. Very nice service. Decor leaves something to be desired, but curries were quite cheap. Very fresh ingredients. Overall, a very pleasant experience. The red chicken curry is my favorite."
Saigon Today,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/1/11,"When I came in I was really disappointed--hot, crowded, smelled a little bit like the fish tank. And then I was seated at a tiny table with strangers. Polite strangers, but strangers. Then the food came. It was AMAZING. Hands down the best Vietnamese food I've had in Berlin, maybe the best food I've had in Berlin. Fresh basil and lemon grass, just the right amount of sauce, chicken breast recognizable as chicken breast. I forgot where I was until the last drop was gone. I don't know when I'll go back--people were literally lined up to wait for a seat at one of the small tables--but I was there between twelve and one. Maybe it's less crowded later in the day? If it weren't for the crowds, I would go back again in a second."
Chi Chu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,3,12/3/12,"This place is advertised as Vietnamese street food, but it certainly has more of a fancy edge, at least in the presentation. The restaurant is small but clean and tastefully decorated. The service is also friendly.It was a cold day so I ordered the vegetarian pho with tofu. The soup itself was good, with plenty of vegetables, which I liked. The tofu was pretty boring though. And there wasn't any Sriracha on the tables, which is kind of a dealbreaker for me.Prices are relatively middle-range here. I have had cheaper Vietnamese food elsewhere, but it was still about the right price for the food portions and quality. Lucky for me, my soup happened to be one of the daily specials as well, and was a euro cheaper.All in all, not a necessary go-to location, but don't knock it 'til you've tried it."
Chi Chu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,12/30/16,"The food was great and the Vietnamese coffee was delicious and much needed to pull us from our peaceful stupor after our meal. The service was a bit slow but she was nice and it was a little chilly inside but, again, the food was delicious. I had the dumpling soup, girlfriend had pad Thai and friend had the veggie pho. The spring rolls and papaya salad were great starters."
Chi Chu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,1/28/17,"Good pho with lots of fresh ingredients. Reasonable prices, fast service. Only a few tables though...its usually packed, so you might wanna reserve a table."
Chi Chu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,6/17/15,This was a life saver as I had no voice and needed a ginger broth soup and found that here with Pho. I'm from Southern California so the pho I have normally is thin vermicelli rice noodle not the wide and flat as well as a bit spicy. Even though my personal expectations were not met I figure since it tastes good and filled the void in a most pleasant area...I'm a fan!
Pan Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,3/8/17,"Definitely coming back to try the other burgers as well as the coco noodle soups. Great service, food came super quick and neatly arranged, quality was top-notch and prices just right and most definitely worth it."
Pan Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/19/16,Flavorful! This place takes authentic Vietnamese tastes and packs it into delicious little burgers. So good!
Pan Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,9/10/16,"Wow! I love Asian flavours and I love burgers, and this place nails the fusion of the two! Amazing!!! Delicious shrimp burger and sweet potato fries and a summery watermelon, pineapple and mint juice to drink was the perfect meal. I can't wait to eat my way through the rest of the menu!!!"
Simply Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,7/22/16,"It is a very quite place located in such a quite and peaceful but remote part of Berlin. When one sits in the garden at the back it very much feels like one is in his own backyard. It has a family , home vibe and is perfect to go enjoy with friends or family away from the hustle and bustle of central Berlin.There were 8 if us and we all ordered something different from each other. Basically we have tasted most of what they have on their main course menu. I can tell you without exaggeration it was all just wonderful with distinct flavors and highly decorated presentation.My only objection, is the price. It is very expensive. For this pice one can as well eat in one of the chick and expensive restaurants in Prenzlauberg."
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,5,12/31/17,Best place in town. Always crowded but you'll always find a seat if you're social. Better be social - it's worth it. ;)
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,5,9/17/17,Yummy! Red curry chicken was super tasty! My boyfriend loved the duck in mango sauce. Fresh vegetables and herbs to all dishes. Great flavour
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,5,11/8/15,"Have been back three more times since the first review, love it that much! Have now had the red curry, chili-garlic curry, and the pad thai. Everything I have had is awesome, truly great. I have gotten duck every time, because I love duck and it's so cheap there, and it's always awesome to go with the sauce and rice or noodles.Cannot recommend this place enough, even though I've tried! Took friends there today, some others went for the first time last night. This might be my favorite restaurant in Berlin right now."
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,4,11/2/15,"The duck meal with green curry for 7.40 EUR tastes like heaven.vietnamese and thai cuisine with love for details and served with a big smile."
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,5,4/18/16,"Excellent, small neighbourhood restaurant !Dishes at this place are always tasteful and very affordable. Staff is really friendly and atmosphere in the restaurant is nice.We love to come here!"
Thai Aroma,Thai,5,Under ?10,4,3/1/16,"I go here for take out about once per week. To be 100% honest their pad thai is not very good and the portion tends to be really small compared to their other dishes. However, I am a big fan of their papaya salad and their curries with duck. Great price, good quality, and great atmosphere considering the fancy neighborhood."
OBOK,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/29/17,this is a great place for a super delicious spicy raymeon and a good bier. very happy to live around the corner and have it as a Stammlokal. very friendly folks run the place.
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,1/5/18,"It's time to face the fact that Lon Men is not the only place that serves killer noodle soup. Shaniu's noodle house is one serious rival in the game of bowls and is not afraid to take the steaming throne.The noodles are also handmade and the broth is rich and bursting with flavours. Don't be too shy to ask the staff, because the owner is adorable AF."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/21/18,"Good quite authentic Chinese food. Great prices, fast service! I'm missing some really good jaozi and bigger vegetable dishes."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,10/17/17,xiaolongbao is legit! My favorite is ???! It's better to make a reservation before coming!
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,2/18/16,"This place has potential but I guess I ordered the wrong thing. It is also not super chinese chinese but rather the lighter, softer less oily korean and japnese inspired chinese food I got the beef noodles (??????which was good. The broth tastes like shoyu (soysauce) based which is not something I expect from this dish. Then the noodles are inspired by Japanese ramen.  Well made but still not niu rou mian that I know. They have daily special for lunch as well and for thursday it is ???? or aubergine in yuxiang sauce which i was gonna order but i thick the eggplants were a big too thickly cut and looked like deep fried so i didnt orderMight come back later to try the squid with kimchi or the xiaolongbaoService was great and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean and every dish is made to order by a very nice ladyAlso, no tap water ?!?"
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,4/29/17,"The light in this restaurant is a bit too bright, but the food they offer is quite ok. Rice can refilled and the meat or squid taste tender! For 104 beef noodle soup, the beef is chewy, noodle could be better and the soup is a bit too salty. And for 35 curry chicken, overall is nice but is actually not so specially which you could have almost the same taste as in other restaurants..."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,12/10/14,"The Beef Noodle Soup is really excellent and tastes just like in China. I have never eaten are more authentic and better Beef Noodle Soup anywhere in Germany. The beef is super tender, sauce has the right flavor and the vegetables are fresh.Also all other dishes are really tasty. They are very authentic and taste like if you eat at someone's home in China. Therefore the dishes are not super fancy, but it's not needed as they just do everything right at this restaurant.The restaurant is run by an old Shanghainese man and his wife. They are very welcoming, friendly and do everything they can to make their guests happy. It's one of those places you'll certainly walk out with a smile.Highly recommending this restaurant. Consider to book a table on Friday nights."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,12/15/14,"After reading serval reviews, my partner and I decided to go to have try it out ourselves. Shaniu's noodle soup restaurant is quite close to the U-Bahn station Spichernstr.. From the station, it took me less 5 mins to find the restaurant. The restaurant itself wasn't so big, but very nice decorated and good atmosphere. After we sat down not long later the waiter brought the menu to us. I spent quite awhile just to see what food they offer. Most of them seem very good. But first I would like to try some sea food, so I ordered the seafood noodle soup, Shao Mai and dumplings. The seafood noodle soup I ordered was quite nice, very light and it tasted good, I think however it could be better, something was missing in the soup for me. Sadly to say, I have tasted something better in Berlin.  I personally like the dumplings very much, it tasted very special, only if there were bigger I would like it more. Shao Mai was also good. Dishes like this with such as low price, best thing could ever happened. After the meals, I started to with the chief a bit. She told me that their kitchen actually mix with Shanghai and Korean style. That was the reason dumplings tasted different, compared with other Chinese restaurants I have been. Some of the noodle soups reminded me the noodle soup from south of China, the looks and the tastes. The service was also really nice and friendly. During the time I was there, I saw quite a lot customers enjoying their meals very much, that was something.Overall, I like it here, very cool price with delicious food. Although it isn't so close to where I stay, I could see myself come back again."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,4/16/17,"Super nice service, super nice homemade noodles and their broth is like CRACK!! Totally addicted after the first hit of spicy noodlesoup"
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/20/15,"We had a great seafood noodle soup in this place. The slow cooked pork was not that superb (the sauce was a bit to jellylike and the meat quite dry) but the noodles were good.Price/quality is good, we ate and drank here for 18? total."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,10/26/16,"This place was a good find thanks to all the yelpers out there. I ordered the beef brisket noodles, bok choi stir fried with shiitake and garlic and chicken with chili oil (was hungry). I was pleasantly surprised on how authentic these dishes tasted having gone to Shanghai a couple of months back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good food. As a added bonus, the staff was very friendly."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,2/10/15,"On a spontaneous decision, my companion and I went here. I have bookmarked this place already, having read glowing reviews before, so when we were feeling lazy and didn't want to cook at home on a weekday evening, I suggested heading here. I should say that it was a good thing that we came in a tad early: we entered at around 19:00 and an hour later, it was packed. I should suggest making a reservation even during the weekday, as I felt like we were simply lucky enough to be early.I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, I loved the appetizers: the marinated pork knuckle was tasty, and the spicy sauce matched it well. The xiaolongbao, while rather diminutive and smaller than other soup dumplings I have had before, was also delicious. The soups, on the other hand, were good, but not spectacular. I had the noodle soup with pork belly: the broth was dark and tasty, the meat was good, but the noodles were a little bit too heavy for me. I couldn't see myself being eager and overly excited about this. Perhaps I am biased to the Japanese ramen: after all, having lived in Japan, that is my standard of what a noodle soup should be, and perhaps the Chinese variety is just too bland and zur?ckgehalten for my taste. There's simply more bells and whistles in the Japanese noodle soup. Hence I am still giving this place 4 stars. The staff after all were great and did everything as they were supposed to be done. And since I haven't been to China yet to evaluate whether they really are doing noodles the way it should be done, then I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 out of 5."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,4/9/17,Excellent food. Duck and dumplings excellent. Very friendly waiters and owner. Price ok. I totally recommend.
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,2,11/22/15,"Last day visiting Berlin from DC. The service was poor. We waited 10minutes to order drinks. People were not pay attention on their customers. However, food came quick once we ordered. The beef noodle soup was fine. But the spicy chicken doesn't has any taste. Too plain. Only chilly oil but doesn't taste any spicy at all. The tofu with black mushroom was not good at all. No traditional sweet taste of Shanghai dish at all. Too much soy source on tofu & looked too dark. It's ok food. Clean place. Since it was rated so high, it came out disappointed. Was expected much more!!"
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/8/15,"I have been here 2 or 3 times recently and have to say that it is very good, it's definitely not German-Chinese!!! :-)  I had Gongbao chicken on the daily specials menu, saut?ed green beans, beef & bok choy on rice noodles and beef with onions. Most main dishes average 6? but then there are other dishes for ca. 9? (beef with noodles and beef with onions).The portions are ample and satisfying."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/17/15,"I went here last night, after a very long trek..I had the gluten cakes (like seitan) with mushrooms, bok choy with garlic sauce, fried veggie dumplings-they were all so delicious! I put tons of the spicy sauce on everything which improved it even more. The dumplings were the best I've had in Europe-small and flavorful with crispy bottoms-try them with the vinegar sauce.The gluten cakes were really delicious and got better the more I had. The mushrooms were really good. I could have eaten two of those dishes.Strangely, the worst things we had were the noodles-4 people had them at my table and 3 reported their soup/fried noodles were bland. The noodles themselves were good but the dishes they were in were overall ok.  I would recommend getting lots of the small dishes or vegetable dishes, my meal was perfect but those who got the noodles and not appetizers were a bit disappointed.Would definitely go back though! The staff were also extremely nice."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,8/24/15,"Cozy little place that serves real Chinese food: we tried the beef noodle soup, fried eggplants w pork wrapped inside, and beef w/ broccoli. All tasted super! & the boss is super nice!!"
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,12/25/14,"Totally hit the spot. Everyone was so nice and accommodating especially since we are beginner German speakers. I'm Chinese and everything we had was very authentic tasting. Very reasonably priced and delicious. Both my kids loved their food as well. We had 3 different types of noodle soups. We tried duck, beef, and pork belly...all were very good. Also the pan fried pork dumplings were excellent. Easy walk from our hotel on Augsburg Str. Large menu with many choices. Highly recommend."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,8/22/14,"Very tasty, and they have the soup-filled dumplings I've been looking for!  Handful of tables in Wilmersdorf, but a nice, clean eating area -- a big step up from your standard Asia Box, with competitive prices.  Menu is split between dim sum-style starters and various noodle dishes, stir fries, and soups.  The house-made noodles were packed full of gluten-y yumminess, and the dumplings were fresh and tender.  Will definitely make this a regular stop when we're looking for Chinese food."
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,10/22/14,I agree that their dumplings are good. But I can't agree that their soups are all that great. Was a little disappointed frankly especially after reading all the great reviews here.
Shaniu?s House of Noodles,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,4/17/15,"Exceptional food, friendly people, highly recommended.Fish flavour aubergine is so good."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,4,2/17/16,"Located in the west side of Berlin, it has a very modern decor and tranquil atmosphere. I was kind of surprised to see the restaurant completely empty which was on the very busy street of Kurf?rstendamm. There were quite a bit of pedestrians walking by, so I wondered if the service or food was bad. Maybe it was the time of day...it was early for dinner...(it was 4 or 5pm)Having grown up on the West Coast of Canada where you're surrounded by Asians who spoke their native tongue (be it their Asian language or English), but never German, it was an interesting experience. At that time, I didn't know any German, and I tried my best to say some things in Korean instead...at least I was able to order my dish saying ? (This please.) as I pointed to the menu. LOL...hahaha...The dishes' portions were small, but good. The banchan (side dishes - typically you get small 4-5 side dishes with kimchi, potato, salad, cooked yam, etc that you can eat with your meal) were really good as well. Much pricier than the Korean restaurants in Vancouver. But, nicely presented. Fresh food. Satisfactory service."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,4,12/23/15,"I am no expert in Korean cuisine. Having had a rather unimpressive BBQ in Seoul, I wasn't raising my expectations too much, but this was delicious!!!We shared the BBQ spare ribs and crispy pork which were some of the best I've even. Ever. The flavours were crisp and the quantities generous. Excellent fresh ingredients and a very friendly and efficient service."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,4,4/20/15,"The seafood pancake was delicious, as was the miso-marinated pork belly. The bulgogi was mediocre though, as most beef dishes in Germany are."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,4,7/4/14,"Unfortunately I only had the pleasure of trying the Bibimbap there, but it was a very nice experience nonetheless!First of all, the ambiente there is very cozy and beautiful, the service was also really nice; our waiter was exceptionally friendly (we even got two miso soups for free).I was there with a friend and we both ordered Bibimbap, which was really delicious. We also got banchan (korean side dishes), which you (unfortunately) do not get in every korean restaurant, so that was nice.The prices were okay for the most part - our Bibimbap  was about 10?. There were also more expensive dishes on the menu, but I haven't tried them (yet ;)), so I cannot say anything about them.Overall, I was very happy with the food, atmosphere and service - definitely a recommendation! 4/5"
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,5,10/7/14,"I was there twice .. Never got disappointed. This is a definitive recommendation if you like Korean food!! And even if you never had tasted it before: Just give it a try! Whenever I will visit Berlin, I try to get there. The quality of the food is great and the size of the servings is more than enough. Food is also cooked near your table on heated plates .. A great experience .."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,5,11/26/13,"My mum was in town and I wanted to take her to a Korean restaurant, the only problem was that it was a Sunday... most Korean places are shut Sundays. I decided on Hanok due to the article in Tip online and was surprised that the restaurant had undergone a huge transformation since the article was written. It's now super chic and pricey.We started with mandu which were excellent. The sauce was very tasty too. We asked the waitress about the portions, whether or not it would be easy to share a main dish. She said most definitely if we were considering Japchae, which we had already discussed. We ordered it and at 28?, better to share ;) The portion was more than plenty for two people. We like things a bit more spicy and asked for a hot sauce which they brought. It turns out it was made there and absolutely incredible. The five side dishes were all excellent as well.The cinnamon tea at the end was excellent and reminded me of when mum made it when I was growing up. We always had some around. Great!"
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,5,5/4/15,"As a Korean living in Copenhagen, where there is almost no Korean food at all. I come often to Berlin to eat korean food. So far Hanok is the best restaurant I've ever been , they serve very authentic Korean food, :)"
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,5,10/19/13,"Delicious.Stylish at least for that part of Berlin.Perfectly friendly and maybe a bit to cautious:u might not like the octopus prepared as koreans like it the recommended sepia & beef bbq was great, and superior to other berlin based korean bbqs.pricing fits."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,5,2/14/15,"I have been coming here over the past ten years. A recent renovation followed the transfer of the business from mother to daughter. Everything is more stylish, the prices have indeed increased. And yet, for the Seoul man inside me, there is no better place in Berlin to enjoy the authentic Korean food, K-pop in the background. Needless to say, the staff and many guests speak Korean."
Hanok,Korean,4,?21-40,3,3/20/13,"This place changed its name to ""Hanok."" Has a comprehensive menu including Korean-Chinese dishes. Not the tastiest place, but staff is very friendly. Would recommend coming for drinking with friends for decent ""ahn-joo."""
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,2/26/17,"Perfect place if you are craving cheap but tasty Asian food.   Not a fancy place but the price is affordable, service is friendly and food is good.  What else can you ask for?"
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,7/3/16,"When you need a craving come here. Portions are decent as are the prices. Everything was very very affordable by any standard and albeit not the most authentic food you'd find, they have a knack for filling that intense craving for some good Asian cuisine (thanks to MSG, perhaps).We had tom yum gong soup (?3) that came with rice, Massamam curry (?4.5), Pha Gra Paw (less recommended, ?5) and fried curry noodles (?4), much like your typical Singaporean curry noodles. It fed us well and we left happy so no complaints. Good job Asia Tiger."
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,12/16/16,"Had a curry (rice + vegetables) for only 4? and it was so good !!! Service, venue, prices, quality of the food, everything is perfect ! Just go !"
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/7/16,"Super Asian ""comfort food"" so to speak. Tasty, good portions, cheap prices, and fast service. I am not even a big fan of Asian Food, but I like the place immensely.Try their Crispy Duck with almost anything :)"
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,8/3/15,"Mixed Asian cuisine...... Glassnoodlesalad is quite tasty, suits the German taste well.... Not spicy at all;)Sushi is not as good as sushi should be but for this cheap price reasonable.It's an easy going place for a cheap and fast snack/lunch/dinner. Don't expect high-end food! I will come back"
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,3/14/12,"Quick and friendly service, although the staff looked a bit bored at the counter when there were no customers to take care of ;) The food was tasty, but I have realized I don't like egg noodles, or at least not the kind served in Berlin. To me the texture feels like spagetti that's been kept in the fridge for a couple of days and then heated in a microwave  and I'm pretty sure they didn't do that in the restaurant, because the food was fresh and with good flavours. I just don't like egg noodles apparantly. So, sure, I think this place is worth a visit because it felt nice and the portion was big and it's cosy and has good prices. Enjoy!"
Asia Tiger,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,5/2/10,"I guess since it's right down the street from where I used to work, I overlooked this place for a while, but that was definitely a mistake. I've tried the different cuisines here, from curry to sushi to pad thai, and had a good experience each time. Plus it's super cheap and the service is prompt. A solid option for Asian food."
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,?11-20,5,11/4/17,"It's difficult to find a good dimsum place in Berlin. Not only are they usually pricy, but they're also not as tasty as what you'd find in the US or UK (outside of China of course).This little jem is a great find. They really meant it when they say hausgemacht, they're true to their word: fresh homemade dimsum! It took a bit of time to get our meals, but it was worth the wait; it's also how you know they're actually made fresh. And the cost is reasonable (I wouldn't say cheap - it's Europe after all).We had just the basics: har gaw, siu mai, and char siu bao - just a quick stop. We're definitely coming back to try the other items."
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,?11-20,5,8/13/17,"One of the best Asian cuisines we have ever been to. We ordered family style and nothing remained on the table at the end. Highly recommend this place, our first real stop in Berlin! The location is in a great area, much happening here."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,11/6/17,"Surprised to find Korean fusion in Berlin. The bibimbap, wings, and burger were all amazing.Cute tiny spot buuut you'll leave smelling like bbq lol. Minor inconvenience."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,9/13/17,"Angry Chicken is a really great hole-in-the-wall KFC joint in Kreuzberg. We started our night here and intended to split an order of wings, but ended up totally filling ourselves up on chicken (and legitimately crying over a platter of the furious chicken). We ordered the sexy chicken (soy garlic), angry chicken (spicy), and the furious chicken (so so spicy wow). The chicken was freshly fried, hot and crispy with a light batter, just the way KFCs should be. Normally, I can handle my spice, especially Korean spices, which I've been eating since I was a kid. But the furious chicken is that kind of spicy that has a slow burn then literally sets your tongue on fire. My first two wings were fine - then during the third wing it kicked in. Also, be careful not to touch your eyes as you wipe away your tears because it will sting (as we learned the hard way). The sexy chicken had a nice balance of sweet and salty with no spice at all, a welcome reprieve after the furious chicken.Angry Chicken has limited seating, with a few tables inside and a few bar tables outside. It looked like most people ordered takeout. The restaurant also has a small selection of drinks - we got some beers, which were decently priced but tasteless. They don't seem to mind if you bring your own drinks, so I'd recommend stopping by a corner store and picking up a better beer to gulp down with your spicy, delicious wings."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,6/30/17,"I had been craving wings for days!  Not saying I didn't love my currywursts, schnitzels, and doner kebabs, but after about a week of German food, I needed some variety.. particularly of the Asian sort... and not Thai sushi shops.Enter Angry Chicken.  Oh how I loved seeing this beacon of Asian deliciousness.  There's something about Korean fried chicken that's super special and very uniquely flavored.  Is it the crunch?  The juicy succulent meat inside?  Or the amazing blend of spices, flavors, and chilis used?  It's probably a mix of all, but those were some delicious wings that definitely satiated my cravings.       SEXY and SO SO ANGRY are the way the go!Some thoughts though....A. I really wish they had more seating/dining space.  Kind of felt like sardines.B. There's no bathroom!  Just a wash basin.C. Service was really friendly too!"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,2,8/25/17,"It's a tourist trap. Chicken Salad for 7,50 was a disappointment.Overpriced and boring fast food. I won't return."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,6/7/16,"If you're ever in Kreuzberg, Berlin, you have to check out Angry Chicken (so so angry).  This cute little Korean restaurant is both punny, and delicious.  When I was traveling, we stayed in a cute neighborhood near Angry Chicken.  Everyday I would walk past it and laugh because the name was so funny.  We finally decided we would regret it if we didn't stop in.The inside is small with writings and drawings from the customers all over the walls.  They have an iPad attached to the wall where you can take an instagram photo and post it to their account.  How neat is that?!The food was not what I thought it was going to be.  They had burgers, fries and chicken wings.  I went with the chicken wing meal.  It was the lowest level of spice, so chili flavor with a hint of cinnamon.  It then came with fries and a beer. The hint of cinnamon calmed down the spice of the wings and added a little sweet flavor to it.  It was so so good.  My friend got the wing salad on a bed of noodles and that was amazing as well.I hope Angry Chicken comes to the states because I am so so sad I won't have it again until I'm in Berlin again."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,5/13/16,"What a interesting name for the place, It is quite easy to miscalled the name of this place. Angry Chicken is a korean fast food, the place is quite easy to find, just look for the pink sign.I went there for lunch, ordered a Bibimbap. something I will definitly try out everytime when I'm in the korean restaurant. It didn't took long, I already got my food. It tasted quite good. Sure, I also saw thoese fried chicken from the other customers, it looks really tasty, probably will try them out next time.The place isn't so big though, At the lunch break could be really busy. I was there around this time. it is actually more space than I expected, but probably was just luck. They also offer order service. if you work or live near by and not feeling to go out. This could be a great choice."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,2,2/4/16,"Tbh this place is overhyped. Yes, you will get a lot of food at a fraction price but the chicken sauce was not even that good. I got chicken salad which was ok but I think it is something that I can make at home (aka vegetables on rice and fried chicken on top) the fried chicken is something I would not be able to  make but theirs were pretty mediocre if not subpar. The so so angry was nothing abt spiciness and the sweet cinnamon was a bit too rundown"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,1/4/16,"In a city dominated by cheap and boring Vietnamese-run sushi spots, even cheaper D?ner Kepab shops, and Turkish-owned burger joints (preferably with ""meister"" in the name), I want to applaud the owners of Angry Chicken. It takes some courage to introduce new food and make a functioning business out of it. The location helps, yes, but you also have to deliver. And Angry Chicken does. While not everything on their menu is great (the burger? the bun was way too dry), they offer plenty of positive surprises. The curly fries - crunchy and well done. The fried chicken - perfectly marinated and spicy. The soju pop in a bag - delightful as a ginger beer mix. Small shop, funky colors, Korean-style. 5 stars for the concept, the food, and the guts to do this.The only thing that makes me angry is that there aren't as many innovative and awesome places in Germany's biggest city as this one. When you're building a business, be smart, be brave and deliver excellent products. Your customers will thank you."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,8/20/16,"The chicken here was really good, as well as the sweet potato chips and the soju pop in a bag. (Even though the soju drink wasn't served in a bag as promised but in a regular plastic cup.) This is definitely more of a take-away place though. There is not a lot of seating and no toilet, which is awfully inconvenient for a place that serves food that will make your fingers really sticky, as well as alcohol. If there had been a toilet the rating of this review definitely would have been higher. If you live nearby, definitely get some! But if you're looking for a place to have lunch or dinner as a tourist, maybe choose a place with a restroom."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,3/30/16,"Since I was craving for Korean fried Chicken that I knew from Korea, I was happy to find Angry Chicken in Berlin. Angry Chicken is a small place in Kreuzberg with a few seats outside and neon-comic style painted walls.The menu is compact and it wont take you  long to make your decision. Besides chicken and fries, they also serve Korean dishes such as  cold noodles (Naengmyun) or Bibimbap. We ordered several styles of chicken flavours which were all pretty good. The cold noodles and the fries are decent. The soju ""cocktail"" with lime which was served in a plastic bag was refreshing but slightly too strong and with too much ice at least for my taste. Is it a chilled place to have some chicken with beer and to watch people, especially in the summer!The reason why I dont give 5 stars is because in my opinion, the dishes are overpriced and the waiting time is quite long. But I still enjoyed the chicken and would come for the chicken again!"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,2,10/13/16,"Quite overhyped. Yeah, the chicken is decent but nothing out of this world. I ordered the Angry chicken menu and all I got was french fries and a bowl of chicken wings.If you really want some fried chicken in good portions, just go to RISA (or KFC if you're a masochist)"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,5/20/17,"Fantastic. If you find yourself in Kreuzberg, this place is a must! Very unique place in Berlin and it is totally worth the money."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,12/28/16,"This is the most different fried chicken I have ever had. And the sauce on top was to die for. If I lived in Berlin, I would be here at least once a week. What an amazing place! The vibe is great. You can take photos on a wall mounted iPad and post it to the restaurant's Instagram, write comments on the walls and laugh at the ridiculous names of the dishes. I totally recommend this place. If you order the chicken, as I did, your fingers will get sticky. IMPORTANT: There is a sink in the back where you can wash your hands."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,1/5/16,"In a word - it's Korean, and it's chicken, and it's angry! :) And you can post your visit photo on any social network - cool marketing. Longer version (for the brave) - we came in on a Friday night and we were the lucky last ones to get in! The menu is not too diverse, but you really don't need more than that - the menu offers are very worthy! I ordered the furious chicken and it's was great, but my friends took all the other chicken wings types and they are all really good! So simple, yet so tasty - the chicken is juicy and the flavors are great. The place is rather small but good music and good ambiance, great atmosphere for storming that chicken bowl P.s - if you are not very tolerant to spicy, don't order the furious, some people lost it over it ;) After we were done we noticed the iPad on the wall so we took a souvenir photo to remind ourselves we totally must come back and try the rest of the menu. Attached below."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,10/15/14,"What is better than fried chicken? An angry chicken! Ok maybe not literally but you get what mean.I've been here with two friends and ordered me the vegan ""happy"" burger. It's a burger with a tofu-polenta-kimchee patty with spinach some sesame mayonnaise between two lovely buns. It took quite a while because the waitress got my order wrong but the guys in the kitchen were super nice and corrected it immediately. The burger was a ish! Super juicy and filled with magic. I LOVE IT.The interior is just amazing. There is that food stall right in the middle of the room used as an table. The walls are covered with doodle-like figures and here and there you have a bit of neon colour. It's loud, cocky and you kind of love it.We chit chatted with one of the waiters and ended up with getting a free refill of our soju pop (slushy with soju, lime and ginger in a sexy plastic bag... I know but it's actually great!). I will definitely come back to this place!"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,6/19/15,"Delicious fried chicken!The cinnamon spicy fried is a must! Spicy and sweet!The graphics of the place are very Good.5"
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,7/21/16,I tried the angry chicken and there was no heat at all.  Chicken itself was decent but nothing amazing.
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,9/27/15,"I discovered this place last weekend and I loved it so much that I went twice that weekend and I think I got a canker sore because of it, but it was so worth it.I haven't had korean fried chicken before, so I'm not sure if I may be over hyping this place, but it's really just delicious.  The chicken is perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside.I wouldn't recommend getting anything other than the So So Angry chicken.  The sauce is just the right amount of spicy and wonderfully sweet.We also had the ramyun (mediocre) and Soju in a bag (great for a little kick in the middle of the day!)Definitely come here."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,5/24/16,"We went there twice and unfortunately the restaurant didn't life up to the expectations. Their speciality is Korean fried chicken. You can get soem wings with different types of sauces, marinates etc. We tried 3 different types, but were disappointed. Overall they are too salty and not tasty enough. Also the meat was somewhat dry, it seemed that the wings have been cooked quite a while ago and then just been reheated. We also had their food once at a Korean streetfood festival and it was great there, so I am not sure what happened the last 2 times there, but I won't go back for a third time... A shame."
Angry Chicken,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,5/26/15,TASTY TASTY TASTY!!! $:&2$492 so good. Wish I could have ordered more food but my stomach can't handle it. Seriously everything is delicious. I got the bibimbap not fleisch and the sweet potato chips (ugh so good) and then had some of the angry chicken (could have gotten my own one instead of a bite of a friends) and an apfel schorle. Friend got the kimchi and the chicken and the bibimbap too and we were both in Korean heaven. Can't emphasize enough how good this place is!! Put it higher on your list than waiting at mustafas cuz this place is a big deal!
H&D Chay,Vietnamese,5,Under ?10,5,6/30/17,"The best vegan food my husband and I ate in our 3 day eat-a-thon in the veg paradise that is Berlin! We shared fried wontons and then I had crispy duck with noodles and salad, and it was really incredible. If you love Asian food (like me) and miss some of the traditional treats that we can't have as vegans (fried meats etc) then I definitely recommend this place. There seems to be a ton of Vietnamese food in Berlin but this place is not to be missed!"
H&D Chay,Vietnamese,5,Under ?10,5,5/7/17,"Had delivery many times and went in in person tonight. Such consistently delicious and fresh food. Amazing faux duck, tofu dishes are equally delicious. The vegetables are full of flavour too. They also played my favourite song 4 times."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/17/12,"This place was recommended by the place we're staying and it was an excellent recommendation.  It is more of a fusion place than a traditional Asian resturant.  So while in yelp it is called ""Chinese"" you won't be finding mapo tofu or other traditional things or even bad western-fied things.The dishes all have creative names and interesting references.  They should have a contest about them!  There are yummy starters like the pumpkin soup with shrimp (The shrimp are amazing by the way). Or fried dumplings (they call them dim sum, but don't expect and carts here,) on what appears to be either melted ice cream or yogurt.  Something bizarre that shouldn't be good but is!  I also tried the seven minutes of pleasure, which is almost large enough for a main, that evokes memories pleasant memories and good taste sensations.The mains are also just as creative and interesting.  Like spicy chicken with Szechuan pepper.  While it doesn't have a lot of that lovely/deadly/numbing ingredient it is there, so points for them.  The beef with sweet potato is amazing as well as the shrimp dish whose name I can't remember.  but it is served with a mango and tomato side that is very well done.  All the mains we've tried are creative and cooked perfectly with good skill.  A tip, get the ""best"" house wine, it is a very nice tempranillo and priced nicely.  the service is attentive and friendly.  Small, so get there early.  Really, I feel this place is four and  half stars, but the disco bathroom buts it over the top!!!"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,9/6/15,"Very artisticly decorated place probably great for small eats and drinking. Dishes are created with thoughts and named impressively and associated with Chinese artists: CHUNG KING EXPRESS, named after the same movie, WANTEN WITH CHICKEN AND PRAWNS SERVED IN HOT SOUP.  GONGLI?S BOAT (named after internationally renowned movie star??) it's FRIED DIM SUM WITH PRAWNS AND CORIANDER CREAM. And MULAN MILAN VERSUS SHE-RIMP. So you get the ideaThe interesting appetizer I ordered was ?DEEP THROAT AVOCADO: KING PRAWNS WITH AVOCADO ON RICECAKE WITH MAYONNAISE AND WASABI. The visual delivery is fine.  However the favor doesn't come up to the uniqueness of the ingredient choice. It's a bit dry due to the rice cake,  even the moisture from avocado and wasabi paste didn't help. Overall, the food is not bad. They are trying hard.  I may go back again to try BRUCE LEE,  OX CHEEKS SALAT IN FINE STRIPES WITH APPLE CUCUMBER AND THICKNESS VINEGAR MARINADE. Or just have a drink in their trendy dining lounge."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,4/30/16,"Went to Toca Rouge for the first time today.food gets 3 stars.Service gets 2 stars at most. Stressed out with no reason (the place was empty as we came in) The place where they have so much customers through tourists that they just dont care if ppl are feeling welcome at all. And after paying the bill you only leave tip coz ""you kind of have to"" and go out disapointed"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,7/1/14,"I expected chinese food.its not at all.... ordered pekingduck,pumpkin soup,something lip(sichuan spicy), lamb something. Taste is not bad not good. Its fusion food that  taste ok.Pumpkin soup was good. Peking duck roll was soso. Main dishes was all soso. Maybe i expected too much.. I love chinese food and i lived about 10 years there.And if this restaurant is in china. Will close very soon.But maybe good taste for german.But my.germam friend said:Good atmosphere, nice price, good starterSoso maindish."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,3/22/14,"It may have been the positive reviews that raised my expectations, but I found the whole experience to be pretty average.I arrived on a Wednesday night and it was packed, elbow to elbow. I don't really mind that (I'm pretty used to small spaces and quite a lot of chatter around me). This is just a note to the people thinking of dining here, that regardless of the day of the week, you may or may not get a table unless you have a reservation.The service here is okay. Nothing spectacular, and there was a bit of a mix-up where a beer my friend ordered went to the table next to us, but hey, things happen.I guess the thing that just left me bored was the food. The rice cake soup (Green White Pool) we ordered was kind of bland and salty. My pork entree with the goji berries (Yasming Dynasty) was okay. The mango salsa that it came with was tasty but the pork was a bit too chewy and the goji berries didn't actually enhance the flavor as much as I wish it had. My friend's fish (Mao's Darling) was also bland but somehow compensated by the salty sauce. I wish it was a bit more balanced. The dessert (Sticky Orange Love Pudding) was good but I felt could be recreated at home after a trip to the Asian supermarket.I did enjoy the disco lights and the random hip hop playing in the bathroom though. Overall, nothing wrong with this establishment. If I do end up going back sometime, I'll try some of the other dishes and see how they are. It just wasn't a wow experience for me."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,8/2/14,"Toca Rouge is classy.The restaurant is intimate with its dark decor, stylish, the food is well presented, and the pricing is perfect for what you get. I always order the same thing when I go - The Red Honey Blonde I think it is called. It is a beef and sweet potatoes dish. I am in love with this dish. My girlfriends ordered an array of appetizers and they were all delic.! The only thing they could work on is the staff. The waitresses could smile or be a bit more engaging. I find myself returning again and again to Toca Rouge since it is delic., fresh, flavorful, unique, and a great place to meet up with a very small group of friends or have a romantic dinner."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,8/3/15,Came here after we couldn't get a table next door. W. O. W. It was amazingly good. Such interesting flavours. Must return to try more of the menu. We had the beef with sweet potato which was my favourite and the duck. Terrific Riesling as well.
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,9/4/11,"In coming to a foreign land, even one as close to the UK as Germany, you kind of feel a bit stupid for going to the kind of restaurant you'd get at home. We ummed and ahhed over the idea of getting Chinese food in Berlin, wondering, what *is* the German view on this type of cuisine? How will it taste? Are we running a risk?Pah! One look at the menu which resembles the opening credits of the Star Wars movies and we were convinced this was the right place to eat. And I can safely say this was like no Chinese food we'd ever experienced before. An ice cold Tsingtao and a plate of veggie dumplings, steamed pak choi and sticky rice, consumed alfresco on a balmy Berlin evening... I was happy indeed. The sauce was fragrant, the pak choi not soggy in the slightest and the dumplings themselves were tender, crisp around the edges and packed to the rafters with greens and fresh delicious veg. This felt wholesome and indulgent at the same time, and that's not an easy combo to achieve.Unfortunately, we didn't do what we were supposed to do and check out the disco bathroom with its unnerving and entertaining flashing coloured lights. I can't believe we forgot about that! Oh well, looks like another trip over to Germany's in order then..."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,10/20/15,Very special atmosphere and delicious food. I have been here a couple of times and never got disappointed. The service is good and attentive. I would not recommend this place to big groups as it is a small restaurant. Group of four is good though. Loved the banana dessert cake.
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,6/19/14,"Meh. This place is a gimmick, from the decor, through the dish names and all the way to the toilet. The food itself was decent, nothing special. Reasonably priced, but they seem to be repeating themselves with different dishes having the same sidings and garnish. The mood is very modernish and hip, but as far as eating goes, you'd enjoy one of the simpler Vietnamese places in Mitte much better."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,7/14/13,"Nice! Funny menu w/ Asian fusion dishes. They combine traditional cooking w/ new and surprising ideas and fresh herbs.Go there, but make a reservation. It's always crowded!And: don't forgot to visit the restroom before you leave ;-)"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,11/30/12,"Great food for fair prices. I had the green soup and the black  honey hot girl beef on sweet potatoes. Delicious. I loved the interior design. Make sure to go and have a look at the bathroom. ;)Downside: no WiFi."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,10/24/12,"Great atmosphere, good food and fairly priced. Highly recommended if you're in Mitte area."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,7/21/14,We left. Horrible. It was a hot day and i wanted some tap/drinking water. They said i could not have any. They required i buy bottled mineral water. No. Bad service.
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,2/2/14,"very stylish restaurant, with good kitchen, cheap rates. high celebrity tight;-), in the summer sitting i did sit outside, in front of the restaurant, somehow really nice. unfortunately, the restaurant is not huge, so it's good to have a reservation"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,3/4/13,"A hip little Asian fusion restaurant and interesting variations on Asian dishes. My favorite item on the menu is Bailing's Lips which is a spicy chicken and vegetable rice dish. The dim sum appetizer is also a favorite item that I order when ever I go there. The young wait staff is excellent and attentive. My only complaints about the place is that it can be noisy and the seating is often a little cramped. The little wooden stools that everyone sits on aren't that comfortable and are always falling over when people rise from their seats. But all things considered,  I really like this place and go there often. The decor is very dark and the lighting is intimate in a modern way. As many others have said check out the bathroom. You won't regret it."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,4/12/13,"I finally made it. I have been wanting to go here for some time! I never new that they were open for lunch, so when I found out, I took my chance. The lunch dishes are all around ?7 and the portions are pretty big. Looking at the menu, the staff seems to have a healthy sense of humor, always appreciated :D The food was served quickly and was delicious. The only reason I am subtracting a star is because the food is quite greasy, but good! Go!"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,4/2/13,"I really liked my dinner here. I'd walk or take a short ride on public transit to eat here again. I ordered a vegetarian ""un-duck-cover"" dish which was very flavorful, a little sweet, a little sour, but not greasy. The prices were not high, but the value was not exceptionally good, as the portion size was not very large. The low light and funky decor created a kind of nightclub atmosphere.English menu and English-speaking staff."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,10/4/09,"Best asian food I had so far in Berlin. The names of the meals are fancy, and the dishes are excellent. Modern Asian dishes, very tasty.The design is simple, but stylish, the open kitchen allows you to see how your food is prepared and the staff is super friendly."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,11/22/12,"Den Begeisterungsst?rmen auf Qype folgend haben wir k?rzlich das Toca Rouge getestet, aber meine Bewertung f?llt etwas bescheidener aus.Ja, die Einrichtung ist hip und cool. Alles in schwarz und ziemlich dunkel, jeder Tisch hat nur eine l?ngliche Taschenlampe als Spotlightbeleuchtung  sicherlich Geschmackssache, aber ich fand's ganz gut. Dennoch stehen die Tische seeeehr eng beieinander, sodass ich fast bei meinem (fremden) Nachbarn auf dem Scho? sa?. Die B?nke an der Wand sehen bequem aus, sind aber kein bisschen gepolstert, daher bin ich nach 1-2 Stunden ziemlich verspannt wieder aufgestanden.Die Bedienung ist freundlich, manchmal sogar eher etwas zu zur?ckhaltend, und die Karte (4-5 ausgedruckte DIN-A4-Seiten, die zusammengetackert wurden  ist wohl auch hip) tats?chlich etwas abgegriffen.Ich entschied mich f?r H?hnchen in Orangenso?e mit Wasserspinat und nat?rlich Reis. Die H?hnchenstreifen waren wirklich lecker paniert, allerdings h?tte man f?r 8.90 Euro auch besseres Fleisch verwenden k?nnen! Ich musste leider ein paar Knorpel oder fettige Stellen aussortieren  sehr ?rgerlich und auch anstrengend w?hrend des Essens, wenn man nicht wei?, ob der n?chste Bissen gut werden w?rde. Die So?e war ganz gut, der Reis auch. Der Wasserspinat machte allerdings eher einen Anschein von Pok Choi, war sehr schwierig zu kauen und blieb dauernd unangenehm im Hals stecken.F?r das Geld und den Hype h?tte ich mehr erwartet  schade!"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/29/17,"The restaurant itself wasn't very big, but it had a nice ambient and interesting decorations e.g. the many lamps and Lego figures. I went with my cousin and we decided to get the tofu bibimbap for 6.60? each, which is rice and other ingredients as toppings like salad, bean sprouts, carrots etc; I personally really liked it, my cousin thought it was a tad bit too spicy for her since she's quite sensitive towards taste.  We also ordered two cups of fresh tea, a ginger for 3.40? if I'm not mistaken and a lemon one for 3.00?; was like your average tea that you could easily make at home however they did add quite a lot of ginger and lemon so the flavor stayed strong. Waiting time was quite short and drinks were served hot with a long spoon and a bottle of honey, food was freshly prepared alongside with clean chopsticks and spoons + a few napkins. Staff was very friendly and polite! The choices of things to order was very limited but good enough in my opinion so the restaurant can focus on bringing the best quality to their customers. I heard great things about the Patbingsu (the shaved ice cream) but didn't have the time to try it out today; will definitely do it next time I visit!!A great place to check out if you're on the hunt for reasonable prices, great quality of food and friendly staff! A big thumbs up"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,3,6/8/17,"This place didn't live up to my expectations, but it wasn't that bad.The staff was neither friendly nor rude, just really disinterested. We waited a pretty long time for our patbingsu and for my coffee. The portion size of the bibimbap was rather small, but it satisfies you.The price was acceptable.But the thing is, this place is just so comfy and has a great atmosphere! Also it has an innovative idea for passing the time while waiting for the ordered food. It gives you lego, with which you can play until you get your food! My friends and me had to try this out, and certainly, the time passed faster than expected. All in all, it's an original caf? which you should try out! The dishes are affordable, but you should visit this caf? mainly because of the original concept and the comfy atmosphere! It's nice to try out :)"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/25/15,"I was introduced to Gong Gan by a Korean friend who assured me that it is the most authentic looking Korean place in Berlin. I wasn't disappointed when we were there. When you enter it appears kind of messy since there is stuff everywhere. Metal lamps are hanging from the wall, boxes are stacked underneath the tables, bike wheels are leaning in the door way... it kind of looks like my room after 4 weeks off fleamarket shopping and knowing where to put that stuff. That's how most caf?s and restaurants look like in Korea (according to my friend).The tables are heavy woodcraft tables and the table for cool kids is the one witch lego inside. Yes. Lego. Awesome.So while you build your most badass megazord you can decide what to eat. The menu is rather small but on point. What about a light Bibimbab with salmon? Their Bibimbab comes with lettuce and is a fresh and light alternative to the Dolsot Bibimbab (in lavastone). Another option would be the regular rice bowls (Deobbab?) topped with a hot saut?d meat/fish. Both dishes are not crazy big and I think they are best for a healthy but not overly stuffing lunch.On hot days I recommend you to try their Pat Bing Su which is a Korean ice dish. It's contains shaved ice cream, condensed milk, red beans and a topping (e.g. matcha). My friend said it's the only place she found it on the menu so far.All in all I like Gong Gan a lot. The staff is super friendly and the food is great for that price but the best thing would be the lego, because... lego."
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,4,9/19/15,"Went to get some patbingsu (shaved ice with condensed milk, sweet red Beans and ricecakes/mochi) on a Saturday afternoon. I wanted to try patbingsu for ages so I guess  I had pretty high expectations.The interior is super cool, a bunch of old lamps and a table with Lego in the middle. We shared the normal patbingsu (you can also get matcha powder, coffee etc. on top) and it was tasty! They could have been more generous with the beans and sadly the mochi was tough and not really flavorful but all in all it was tasty and since it's the only place in Berlin that serves this dessert so far I will come back :)"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/5/15,"Very child friendly with the Lego play station :) my one year old loved it. Owner and workers are very personable, all speak English, Korean and German which is convenient.Atmosphere is really nice; vintage feel, a little cluttered but it was comfortable.Ordered: tuna ""dub bap"" aka hot rice with tuna and seasoned vegetables, my husband ordered beef bibimbap and they were both so delicious!! My son loved it too, couldn't get enough. To top it off we had sweet red bean shaved ice with powder with some sweet rice cake, it's comparable to shaved ice that I've actually had in Korea, if not better. Not a coffee drinker but apparently the caffeinated drinks are legit as well. The menu is quite small, so if you're just looking to eat bibimbap then you're going to the right place!! Definitely will be coming her frequently."
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,5,4/17/16,"So me and my friend found this place by accident. At first glance Gong Gan does not look like the typical western caf?/restaurant. It's charme and atmosphere are simply amazing and the service was also super nice. The menu is not the biggest but I would say our highlight was the Pat Bing Su,Which is a korean dessert."
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,3,9/5/14,"Went two times. 1st for patbingsu 2nd for bibimbap. I will Go there only for patbingsu. Not bibimbap. I can see that they changed ingredients which can find here easily (its fine cause some ingredients hard to find here) but price is expensive for this dish with this ingredients. And take too long time to prepare. Even there is NO ingredients need longntime to prepare. Weird service. Had little talk with him, not really friendly.. (but its not rude)and also saw scene that owner blame part-time worker in front of customer. (It happen but hmm)"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/3/14,"Love this little cafe/restaurant. It's very cool and quirky, Seoul-meets-Berlin style place. At the same time it is kind of hard to find seating since the place is cluttered with old lamps and trinkets (part of its charm) which doesn't bother me personally but people should be aware about. Bibimbap is not your traditional kind but very fresh and tasty. It definitely has a Korean taste to it, though, with the sesame seed oil and spicy flavors coming through. I don't come here all the time, but when I do, it's a pleasure. I haven't tried any of the desserts on the menu, but now am looking forward to!"
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/12/14,Had an excellent bibimbab and a couple of beers at this weird but very charming place.
Gong Gan,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/11/14,"The food and the atmosphere are always good for someone like me who is picky about quality, cleanliness, noise levels, style.. I love this little place. It's my new fave."

Mai Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,7/13/15,"Though the fried rice was a bit heavy on the oil, it was very tasty (and cheap!). The soup was good too. This place was open on Sunday at 9pm, and that's always helpful. It was quick and the staff was friendly. They have a menu in English, if it's needed. I'd recommend it."
Mai Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,1/29/16,A decent Asian food. I had noodles with chicken and I was pretty happy about them. The portions are big and prices are good - around 5 euros per dish.
Mai Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,3/11/12,"The food is average. When I first walked in the door, I wondered whether the owner/workers/chefs were Thai. I believe they're Vietnamese. Not to say that Vietnamese can't cook Thai food well, but it raised my suspicions of the authenticity of the food. I ordered a red curry with salmon and asked for spicy, and the dish wasn't dumbed down for the German palate, which is good. But the ingredients are not typical Thai ingredients. If I'm not mistaken, I don't believe Thai's generally use broccoli in their curry. Also I think the salmon was previously frozen, as the meat tasted a bit dry. Service was friendly, in a simple cafe style ambiance. Price was very reasonable."
Mai Thai Snack,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,12/21/08,"Greasy food and not made with the same love I can get in Moabit. Nice interior, but food doesn't cut it for me."
Kim?s Ha,Vietnamese,5,Under ?10,5,7/13/17,Excellent Vietnamese food for reasonable prices. My favorite was soup with glass noodles and beef. But curry is delicious as well. Restaurant is clean and adequately furnished. Waitress was very nice and each of us get a slice of melon after our lunch on behalf of the restaurant . Highly recommended if you like this kind of food or just want to try it for the first time.
Kim?s Ha,Vietnamese,5,Under ?10,5,10/14/16,Delicious food.  Good curry.   Very reasonable prices for Berlin.   Very nice little restaurant with very nice staff.  If you like curry and Vietnamese food give this place a try.
Kim?s Ha,Vietnamese,5,Under ?10,5,8/14/16,"Excellent Asian cuisine at unbeatable prices.  A word to the wise: if they ask if you can do 'spicy', think twice before answering.  Still, the food was immensely delicious and an efficient cure for a stuffy nose."
Papaya,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/19/16,"i was there late after 11, but still got some delicious food, yummy papaya salad and great spicy curry! delicious! very friendly staff!"
Papaya,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,2/3/17,"cant really recommend the place. food tastes good and ambience is ok but very time i went there, afterwards i did not feel that good. thats why only 3 stars"
Papaya,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,2/2/13,"Gutes, asiatisches Essen. Sehr schmackhaft und frisch zubereitet. Leider nicht so viele Pl?tze im Winter, Bedienung k?nnte auch etwa freundlicher sein! Trotzdem lecker!!"
Sam Yuk Gu,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/22/17,"I've been there a couple of times and always ordered the same thing. I can't remember how it is spelled but it basically is Korean BBQ :) It was good but nothing special. I wish the place had a wider variety of menu. Been wanting to try Bibimbap there but haven't got a chance yet. Pricewise, I would say it's affordable and suits the quality of the food they serve. Good to have a Korean restaurant in this area though :)"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,10/17/17,"Now this doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has really good quality tasting Chinese food.  I brought my friend who lived in China for 5 years here, and he said it was the first time in a long while he's had a flashback of his days in China while eating the food.   On a side note, the waitress was very friendly."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,10/26/15,"It doesn't look like that but this place serves pretty authentic chinese dishes BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RED MENU CARD NOT THE PAPER ONE. I REPEAT RED!!Because that's where the good stuff is.I have been here twice one time I made the mistake and didn't followed the instruction and just ordered what was on the boards. (The food was meh)After asking a fellow foodie I found out what to do:You go inside and act as of you are fully aware of how this shit works like really confident and SIT DOWN. Don't go to the desks. May be don't smile. Just be very confident. If you look cool enough they'll bring you the red menu and you scored. This time the food was nice although I accidently ordered something with meat. The menu is totally random and has no specific order. But remember: You are aware of all that!I had the pak choi with steamed egg (filled with meat as I found out) and hacao (which are filled with chicken and shrimps instead of shrimps only). Was still good.Staff is ... Well it feels like this place is the god damn Berghain among cheap Asian venues. They don't smile and are not friendly but not rude either. It's weird."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,2/11/17,"This is straight-up some of the best Chinese food in Berlin. The outside can be severely misleading and the staff barely speaks German, which pays homage to the authenticity of the joint. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves tasty Chinese food!"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/4/16,"One of the best tasting Chinese restaurants I've been to. Do not let the ""Imbiss""-style store front scare you off, this place is awesome. Make sure you get the red menu, that's where the great food is and go for all the specialities."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,2,3/31/14,"Based on the reviews, I tried this place the other day. I also felt much better when I walked in and there were a number of Chinese people eating there... I ordered a beef with peanut sauce dish. It was just okay, I've experienced  much better but the price was about 5?..."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,7/27/11,"This place doesn't look like much outside or inside but it's actually really good. Great price and good taste.The old chef was a real master, some of the best Chinese food I ever had, but sadly moved back to China in 2010, the new chefs are getting better all the time though, not quite up to the old standard yetChoose from the menu, not the set plates on the board, much better food."
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/6/17,"So freaking good! The food was amazing and authentic. The only negative was that we had to pay 50cents for tap water, which is understandable but unusual. Great experience. Best in Friedrichshain!"
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/29/16,the soups here were amazingly flavourful and the shrimp summer roll and dipping sauce were fresh and tasty . this place perfect for a light hungover dinner !
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/12/13,"We were walking through Friedrichshain during some snow, so we stepped inside Soup & Rolls for some warmth and Asian food.  The sign that said ""bubble tea"" and ""free wifi"" caught our eye.Inside, it was nice and cozy.  We each took a cushion for the wooden chairs and benches, and proceeded to order a spring roll, chicken curry, and bubble tea to share.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, but nothing particular to write home about: the spring roll was tasty but a bit small, the curry was good, and the bubble tea was good but only came in one flavor--for us, it was mango with poppers (juice balls) instead of pearls.  Pricing was very moderate/inexpensive: can't remember exactly, but probably around 2.50 euros for the spring rolls, 6 or 7 for the curry, 3 for the bubble tea.So, overall: I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but if you're in the area already, might as well give it a shot!"
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,2/1/15,"I had shrimps summer rolls and chicken pho and a drink ( I forgot the name but) Whatever I can't belive what their preise totall 9.99 were. Include all others.I wanted give this restaurants 4 points but why 3 points gave.Nearby here no many vietnam restaurants so they seem like too busy.Even if the time when I go there it was not lunch time or not dinnertime,I orderd shrimps summer rolls but firsttime I had to took chicken rolls and I asked about my pho ""ohne corinander"". but in my pho there are corinanders.I was little tired to ask again to busy staff, I ate the pho with corinanders but it's good.I loved the sause in rolls. I think their menu are very classic, so they can focus on them to only good. I think It's very good way.Their ingredient are very fresh and I enjoyed it."
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/4/15,So cheap and yummy! One of my favorites. I come here at least once a week for one of the noodle salads or mango tofu.
Soup & Rolls,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/1/15,"Maybe not the very best food in the area, but they serve tasty dishes, very quick and at a very good price. I like to come here after work to get a quick, delicious dinner at an affordable price. Oh and I love their soups."
Sichuan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,1,11/26/16,"Not much test to the food.Can not recommend it.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmm mmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm"
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,3/31/17,"I had this bookmarked for two years now, and finally I got a chance to visit it. It was recommended to me by a Korean colleague, and today I went here for lunch, as I was in the look out for a new place to eat. I purposely headed out here, and I was definitely rewarded!Get there before 15:00 for lunch. They have bibimbap for lunch, and since I always order this for every Korean restaurant I visit for the first time, I went for it. I was impressed.They have a very flavorful bowl of bibimbap, with your choice of meat (or vegetarian, of course). They also give you a small plate of kimchi and pickled vegetables, as well as throbbing containers of soy sauce and hot sauce. Man I had fun!By the way, this is not an ordinary Korean restaurant. It's a tea room, and their collection of teas is massive. That said, I haven't had the chance to try it, so perhaps next time, as there definitely will be a next time."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,7/26/17,"I think this has become my favorite Korean restaurant that I've ever visited. Came here with 2 friends on a rainy Saturday and got seated right away. The service was FANTASTIC, the food DELICIOUS (got the hot bibimbap) and the atmosphere AWESOME! And the iced ginger tea is soo good! Would definitely be back, and I absolutely recommend it."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,2/8/16,"Cheap lunch option for bibimbap and kimchee.  Homemade and very cozy place with a wide selection of teaThe bibimbap was ok. Not dolsot (hot stone) so that was a bit sad but i think dolsot bibimbap is pretty hard to find in germany as well."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,9/21/16,Da Bangg is much more than a tea house. They serve jip bop style (homemade) Korean dishes in a very cozy environment. I tried the bibimbob and shared a pot of tea with my friend who is a regular local customer and it was delicious! Congratz on the 5 year anniversary celebration!
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,10/6/15,"It is a cosy little place to enjoy delicious Korean food. The combination of a tea house/restaurant has been a new experience but if you do not feel like leaving the place after the meal you can taste a good cup of tea on the terrace. You will come across a very lovely lady ( the owner of the place?) who will be delighted to serve you the awesome food of her place."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,10/19/16,"To go there is like entering a whole diffrent time zone. Special atmosphere. Tasty food, also for vegan. quiet and peacefull. Very nice tea. We are going there at least twice a month to have some tea."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,10/24/14,"it was such a wonderful restaurant in Berlin?it is not so big but quiet and comfortable?besides many ceramics?m there is also relaxed music playing inside?the atmosphere is really great for anyone who needs to release pressure and pure heart.food is also good and "" art"". I can feel the thoughts of the nice and faithful shopkeeper ?i admired her ?For me ?it is  quite a good and little  Paradise ?i will often come here and calm down my heart."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,2/11/17,"I studied abroad in Berlin for a quarter, and this was my most-frequented restaurant. The tea was great (lotus was my favorite), and the bibimbap was very tasty. On top of that, the decor was cosy and deligthful and every detail was well thought-out."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,11/22/15,"everything is so nice. very kind owner, delicious foods(!!!!!!!), and korean music. atmosphere was awesome. totally same as Insadong in Seoul."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,4/14/16,Was here only once but it made quite an impression on me. Take a moment to look around you and feel the love with which it's been decorated. Every business should have so much heart.
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,1/18/15,"We loved this place! The bibimbap was delicious, fresh, perfectly balanced and flavorful. The mandu dumplings were good too. The Korean onigiri (cannot remember the name) was so yummy it even had a seaweed with a happy face on it. Try the special teas. So good. Best service, thoughtful & kind. I would come here again! And again."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,5/2/16,This is a gem of a restaurant! It is the realization of someone's passion or at least that is the impression I had. Pork-belly was fantastic but for a clear conscience I recommend the Bipimbap. (I like the one that doesn't come in the hot stone bowl. If you like tea... you are in for a treat.
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,2/20/15,"It's a quite standard Korean restaurant but with a very strange feeling Cuz it's a cafe(tee house). Traditional Korean food are good, the waitress are nice and the environment is cute and it's good for a little date. But... Kind of weird to eat hot stuff like Korean dishes :D but anyway it's good"
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,2,9/1/14,"Unfortunately I can't share the enthusiasm with my yelp colleges. The food very mediocre, not too much choices, even when it comes to drinking. The tea also wasn't fabulous, so bitter that I couldn't even drink it. The ladies who serve are very nice, but it takes them forever...If someone is expecting a wild korean experience, its definitely not the place."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,7/24/14,"DaBangg = DaBoom ;) - Hidden gem in the Berlin.Food and presentation was great.The owner is a real hoot. She has really put her heart and soul into her Restaurant / Tee House. Her personal touches are everywhere and she shared some of her great plans for the future with us. We can't wait for whats to come. We will definitely be going back."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,8/15/14,"I like this place. Went with a friend and he had the Bimbimpap which was a wise choice. My soup however was too small and the noodles didn't seem right for that menu item. It's obviously run with a lot of love and the service is friendly (pace is a little slow). Great if your not in a rush and stay away from the soups.And yes they take credit cards which in Berlin is not a given. I don't like to carry a lot of cash around so businesses that take credit cards get more of my business."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,4,8/27/15,"It's actually really hard to find this place as it's not the typical restaurant style that you would except. Instead, you entire in this corner and find yourself in what seems like a little cafe that can easily be the living room of the owner's house. The food was pretty good and well priced. Would recommend going for a chill, easy-going vibe."
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,8/12/15,"Great place to have some fine and delicious tea and awesome korean food! Definitely recommend this restaurant. The owner is such a nice lady and always takes time for you. Atmosphere , food, tea, service, ... - Top. If you havn't tried this out yet, go for it ;)"
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,12/7/14,Without words... this is my favorite place in Berlin :) the food is extraordinary fantastic and its full of love :) It's like you are joining a family or old friends for dinner :) truly welcoming. Make sure you go for the bimbimbab! I come here as kind of a ritual with my little. sometimes we turn the place into a playground and everyone is fine with it :) thanks for the lovely times
DaBangg,Korean,5,?11-20,5,3/28/15,"A wonderful place! Delicious, carefully prepared and arranged food and a very cozy pleasant atmosphere. We ordered dumplings and beef bibimbap, both of which were excellent. The service was exceptional and I was sad to leave, even after staying an additional hour to chat and enjoy the relaxing ambiance. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a cozy place to enjoy fantastic Korean food. The people working there are wonderful and I wish I could return to thank them for the memorable meal."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/26/10,"So, after wandering about the Soviet-inspired city-planning horror that is Karl Marx Allee, I was hungry and needed a good meal... and on a cold and rainy Saturday, with the streets almost empty, I ventured into this welcoming spot.Unexpectedly, a menu in English appeared, the owner was more than accommodating in getting me a glass of water (with ICE!) they he didn't bill me for! The build out is top notch - comfortable and decorous, without being schmaltzy like some asian places.I ordered a sublime sweet and sour chicken - a meal that was simply perfect in so many ways.... and, honestly, a portion I should hav shared with someone else, but greedily ate most of it. Nice touch: The plate is served on a small pedestal that holds a candle to keep it warm as you dine. It looks great and actually works.For many cities, this place would probably get 4 stars, but here in Berlin - they get 5 for the extras."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,5/24/17,"First off, loved all the fish tanks that this restaurant had. The food was very good and filling. The portion sizes were really good for the price. I went with some friends so we were able to pick and choose a ton of dishes and split everything. Worked out to be a high quality dinner that also gave each of us a variety of food."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/23/15,Nice restaurant. Good service nice portions of food would  definitely go there again. Best chinese i have had in berlin
Asia Foodland,Thai,5,,5,6/15/16,"Wow! They have so many products!You can get Thai, Korean and many others!The best of all is the thai food that you can eat there. The cook is very friendly. Actually all their staff are very nice."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/6/16,"My favorite meal in Berlin! Very affordable, and very tasty. Kind staff, quick service, lovely atmosphere.Entrees: #52, crispy duck, is to die for. veggie/vegan: many options, my friend got fried tofu with noodles and said it was greatAppetizers: fried wontons are AMAZING (not huge portions, so if you're hungry get a few...they're only a few euros). The vegetarian spring rolls are also great."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,2/4/17,Nothing was tasty. The lime chicken was inedible; the meat felt like it's been boiled dry. The gado gado wasn't a gado gado; there was frozen boiled carrots and peas in it.. . Everything tastes like cheap sauces from the Asia shelf at the supermarket. Nothing is fresh.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/30/15,"Such a pleasant surprise last sunday dinnerI honestly didn't have so many expectations looking at the price of the food which is relative cheap, but the dishes were simply well done, good quantity, delicious taste and pretty good varieties of choicesI took a chicken dish with Sumatra sauce with peppers, my friend took the duck. The chicken was well cooked the spicy was balanced the coconut sauce was not covering everything like sometimes happens with this kitchen type; the duck crispy and the side dish was made up of vegetables and a little sweet sauceI think the fortune of this place at the moment is the a capable chef. You could cut the chicken with the forkThe place inside is nice; there is also a more elevate space for a couple of tables in the end of the roomI'm sure I will be back hereUPDATE 19/09/2015Since I recently found this place I've been here 3 times (please don't go to imbiss so frequently!), trying different dishes, always with an excellent service"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,8/10/17,"This place used to be so good. Now the service is very poor, and the dishes bad quality. I used to come here all the time, but now I find there are much better places in this area. i have a pet peeve for restaurants living off of ""former glory"" and getting worse in service and quality.sadness."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,6/12/16,"Very good value! Cheap price and tasty food. Cozy restaurant, veeeery friendly waiters! The two of us ordered the snack plate as a starter, the black dragon and 4 small bowls (spicy fish, Sumatra tofu, rice and mango salad) as a main. Everything was delicious (especially the snack plate, sumatra tofu and black dragon). Good portion size! Will be back for sure :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/21/15,"Absolutely loved this place. First off, we were sat right away, which is a good start. We did come on a Saturday, and it was fairly busy. I love that you have the option of ordering smaller, sample sized portions. It gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes if you can't decide on what you want. We decided to start with Gado Gado, and (two) fried pork dumplings. This was my first time trying Gado Gado, and though I am not usually a fan of tofu, I really enjoyed it! And for only 3 Euros, it was definitely worth it. The dumplings were also great. I liked that they were pan friend, rather than deep fried. For mains, we ordered the Peanut Duck and the Lime Chicken. Both were delicious. Good presentation as well. My one complaint would be that the duck was slightly overcooked, which made it a bit chewy.  Overall, the food was very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I am excited to go back, and next time, try a couple more dishes out."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/9/13,"Given the name of this restaurant, I am sure that plenty of people have come here to have a juvenile moment. Anyway, my companion and I tried this one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all, I have this idea that as Berlin has plenty of Asian restaurants, it cannot be the case that all of them are good. So perhaps there are more bad restaurants than good ones. This is coming from someone who is still surprised to see Thai and Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine in one roof.Anyway, like I said, our food was rather good. And given the price, I expected something bare-bones, but what we got were rather swanky. I ordered the Sumatra duck, and it was said to be rather spicy. Beware of the red chilli peppers; they really are hot. My companion ordered the spicy duck, which was more a hot and sour sauce. Both came with rice. And we washed it both with iced ginger tea. Overall, I think it was a good choice. I'd be more than willing to go back here again when I have the chance."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/15/16,Ordered the normal chicken nudles and the duck with black pepper sauce&rice and couldn't decide which one was better. Also the service was great!
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,1,6/24/16,"This place is terrible. Why did I believe the yelp reviews? The food is not fresh nor good quality and is masked in pre-mixed sauces, over fried in old oil and served in small cheap portions - reflecting the quality. The chicken looked as though it was breed on hormones and pumped with water and starch. I don't usually bother to write bad reviews but I feel stupid for going here and want to warn others against it. Tourist trap. Bad."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/7/14,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!Best food, friendliest stuff, beautiful atmosphere, fair prices...always.Try the chicken satay, the chicken wings, black dragon, the mango salad or peanut tofu... all at once! (there is an option to try several dishes in smaller bowls instead of only ordering one big one) Anyway, enjoy! :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,3,11/2/14,"Aside from the creepy, questionably non-PC name, this place was aight. I like that in the menu, they specify what is in all of the sauces they use, since usually in an Indonesian or similar restaurant, I am not too familiar with the types of sauces they have. Other than that, I didn't think this restaurant offered anything too unique. The food was just ok and will do if you are craving Indonesian food. Service was again, just ok. The atmosphere was comfortable, but I honestly am not that convinced to come back again."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/6/14,"Amazing, this place was so cute and so good.Service was great and the courses were large. Note-if you take a rice table which is cool because you can share, the plates are really small..so if you are on a budget go for the bigger plates.. Would really recommend for a nice night out with good food..Have been there twice and I really think you can't go wrong...Delish!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/1/14,"Service & Atmosphere: Very friendly and prompt service. I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don't have to wait long for foodFood: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! Drinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.Price: I don't know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each? Which is great if you want to try a lot of things and works out to be a similar price as a main!In short: Definitely recommend this place!!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/22/16,A great find on a rainy night. Delicious food with authentic flavours for the right price. Very friendly and quick service.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,11/30/14,"Average, didn't know how it deserved the 4.5 stars. We all ordered different dishes with entr?e and from five people had no positive feedback. Give it a miss"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/17/15,We tried the vegetarian food and it was really good. I had the tastiest Tofus ever and I will definitely come again.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/23/14,"The food here was completely delicious, we were able to share a few small options between 3 of us, very tasty. The drinks are reasonably prices, and the atmosphere and service was very good!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/13/14,We really liked this place. The atmosphere was great. The waiter very friendly. The prices were good and the appetizers out of this world.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/12/10,Good Indonesian food here. I tried the rijsttafel (rice table) and it was very good. Lots choices to mix and match with just the right amount of spice. Prices are very reasonable to boot.
Dan Thai Food,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/27/15,"Hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant serving up delicious and authentic fare. I just shared 7, 19, and 21 with another person and they were all spectacular. Get on it!"
Dan Thai Food,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/6/16,"The place is crazy small so some people just drop by to get some take-away. I recommend to come in small groups or take the food to a park close by to avoid stress.The menu was quite big for such a small venue and they also had some cards with special offers (such as the larb tofu). In terms of drinks they only lack on Thai ice tea but you will find different soft drinks and beer here. It's nothing posh, it's in fact a bit shabby but DAMN the food doe! Me and my friend  always care more for the food than for the interior so we'd definitely come back for more! The prices are very fair as well. We paid 19? in total for 3 dishes and left this place very happy!"
Dan Thai Food,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/13/17,"You might have to undergo some discomfort in order to eat here, but believe me, it's worth it. Really delicious authentic Thai food."
Dan Thai Food,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/10/17,"Now that Berlin Food Stories has written about the place, the cat is out of the bag! Probably the most authentic Thai meal one can get in Berlin. The only drawback is the size of the place (think a tiny lounge area of a London bedsit), so it helps to get there right before 12 (or ring up to take-away if you live/work nearby). Better in the summer as you get 10 seats outside."
Dan Thai Food,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/30/16,"Delicious red curry for 7?, and they gracefully agreed to my request for more veggies and less chicken in it. Hole-in-the-wall gem!"
Pig & Tiger,Korean,3,?21-40,4,12/13/15,Nice atmosphere and rather small menu with a good selection of food. It's a tiny bit overpriced but still okay. Not the best Korean place ever but worth a visit.
Pig & Tiger,Korean,3,?21-40,2,12/13/17,"Food wasn't that good (lack of flavor and the ingredients just didn't make sense together... like why were there raw mushrooms and thickly cut cucumber in my udon noodle with pulled pork?), food was overpriced for the small portions that you get. I also tried their fried chicken strips and pulled pork buns and those were bland and underwhelming. Atmosphere was fine though, though nothing special.I've eaten at a lot of Asian restaurants in Berlin, and I would say, spend your money elsewhere."
Pig & Tiger,Korean,3,?21-40,3,11/15/15,"I'm not so sure of this place. It's good, but it's definitely overpriced. There are better Korean and Asian fusion places in Berlin."
Pig & Tiger,Korean,3,?21-40,5,11/15/15,"Love the small menu with delicious items. Kim chi was amazing and the butter garlic edamame. The food is fresh, delicious, and well priced."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,10/8/17,Great Thai food. Upscale and cozy atmosphere. Really friendly staff and I found the prices to be relatively cheap. Most appetizers around 4.5 euro most main dishes between 6-9 euro. And their soft drinks come with ice and in a large glass (something us Americans are used to that is fee to come by in Europe). Wish I had room for desert but we stuffed our selves with a bunch of appetizers and entres. I had the vegi spring rolls and the vegi pad Thai. Both were great.
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,7/25/17,"3.5 stars. Service was great! Super friendly staff!However, I rate thai restaurants based on their pad see ew's and unfortunately, this restaurant like a lot of others in Europe don't use the real noodles when cooking pad see ew, and instead opt for the same type of noodles used in pad thais. If you're into curry dishes, then I would assume them to be delicious :)"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,7/24/17,"Like this Thai Restaurant ! I was here several times for lunch ! Good food , Nice dessert and midday Cocktail"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,7/7/17,"There are many options around, but eating here was the right choice! Their menu is extensive, with options from veggie, chicken, and pork, to squid and duck. I was unadventurous and went for the Pad Thai Gai (chicken), which was a large portion that hit the spot perfectly. I had their recommended Himbeere-Minze Shake (Raspberry Mint), which was refreshing and tasty. I certainly plan to come back to try one of their many other options."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,11/4/14,"Solid Thai eats, and I'm thoroughly amused at how our server thought my co-worker and I were trying to invite him home for a threesome. Those are the pitfalls of speaking no German while still being friendly.So happy to follow the trail to Sarod's left by other Yelpers.We started off with some mixed veggies fried in a light batter, along with some fish balls on a skewer.My pad see ew with pork was done well, though it could have used a little more sizzle from the wok to beef up the noodle texture. The pad thai my eatin' mate smashed into his face looked tastier, and I was rather jealous.With our bill, we also got a little shot of plum wine each (even if it sounded like ""phlegm wine"" when we were first handed it).Solid joint, and I'd go back!"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/26/16,This may be my favorite place to eat in Berlin! Great Thai food. Pretty good portion sizes. Friendly staff who speak great English. They take credit cards! (Always nice for us Americans abroad.) The pad Thai is fantastic. As are all of their curries. The food isn't too spicy. But if you tell the waitress you like spicy she will take your bet and make it as hot as possible!
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,2/3/16,Had the best Tom Ka ever at this place and the hostess was so nice. I was pleasantly surprised that Berlin had great Thai options.
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,9/10/16,"Fresh food, tom kha gung was good but a bit pricy (4,70? for a teeny tiny bowl). We came in when the kitchen was about to close...so this place might be better when you get there earlier ;)"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,2,12/27/15,"this place is by no means ""authentically"" thai, but this is not in itself a problem - the problem is that the food actually doesn't taste good and it's too damn salty.friendly service but priced too high for what you are served."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,9/17/12,"Some friends and I were in need of dinner yesterday, and since we were all new to the city, we decided to consult Yelp and see if there are any interesting restaurants that we can visit. Upon reaching the conclusion that Mitte doesn't provide any good choices, we headed out into Kreuzberg again, and found Sarod's, a Thai place.When we got there, the outside area was crowded, so we sat at the back. I ordered Pad Thai Gung, which comes with shrimp, as well as a large Coke. I believe my Pad Thai was 7,60 EUR, which was not bad. My friends' dishes also came out satisfactorily. The service, however, is rather slow. I am slowly getting the impression that service in German restaurants are slower than what I was used to in Western New York. First, they took a long time to get our orders. Then it took a long time to get our food. Finally, they took a long time to give us our bill, so we just went ahead and went to the counter to pay. Overall, I am comfortable giving this restaurant 4 stars. I think the food was exemplary, and is worth 5 stars. But the service is a little slow for my taste, so I am giving it 3 stars for service. Everything considered, I am giving this place 4 stars. I will definitely be back here again, for the food was great. I'll just make sure I have no immediate appointment after dinner."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,2,7/27/15,"That was sort of okay. Had a Gai Phad Med (chicken cashew), which kind of disappointed. Staff wasn't overly friendly either. I've had much better."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,8/12/14,"The papaya salad is amazing although they could ease up a little with the garlic. The Hugo cocktail is very refreshing. Pricey Thai food but good quality."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,8/26/15,"I was excited to try this place because of the reviews, but I would say it's just ""OK"".  Not sure what everyone else is eating, but I won't be back.  Wasn't the worst Thai I've had, but wasn't that great either.   The red curry was so salty I could barely eat it.  The fried rice was decent- just needed a bit more heat.  Friendly staff and nice decor though."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,3/18/14,"Sarod's delivered exactly what I was looking for - delicious & SPICY Thai food!  Disclaimer: If you want the food ""Thai spicy"" you NEED TO ASK FOR IT.  No Thai restaurants I have ever been to serve their food Thai spicy unless you ask for it to be made that way.  I just moved to Berlin about 2 weeks ago from a very ethnically diverse area in Virginia and I was seriously craving Asian food.  I chose Sarod's because of it's great reviews (both from Germans and Americans) and it did not disappoint!The location is great and the interior is beautiful.  It would be a great place for a date!  The prices aren't bad - entrees range from about 6-14 Euros, depending on the size (most are available in small or large).  The staff was very friendly and helpful and they do speak English fairly well, which is good for newbie Berliners like us.  The menu is HUGE.  It took us at least 10 minutes to choose our entrees because everything sounded awesome.My husband had the Tom Yam Gung hot pot and I had the duck Ped Khimau.  Both were delicious and made ""Thai spicy"" the way we asked.  It was so refreshing to have some real spicy food in Germany!  We probably should have ordered smaller entrees - even with sharing we were both too full to finish everything.  Maybe the vegetables that come with the entrees aren't entirely authentic, as some other Yelpers have suggested, but we're not in Thailand so give them a break!  They do use real bird's eye chilies (we asked).  Overall everything was great - service, food & experience."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,1,6/30/13,"I had given up trying to find decent Thai in Berlin, but this place had so many good reviews I figured I'd try it. At the risk of being a jerk, I feel the need to provide a dissenting voice to this praise-fest going on.This place is another sanitised, spice-averse Thai place that serves curry-flavoured water filled with vegetables that actual Thai people don't eat (and none that they do - pea eggplants, apple eggplants, grachai etc.) that seems like the norm in Berlin. Not authentic by any stretch (the tables are set with chopsticks - kinda a red flag for a Thai restaurant.)I don't know why people go so nuts for this stuff here, it's truly baffling. The staff are friendly though.And that concludes my rant."
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,11/20/11,"Food was really quite good and the service was rather friendly and excellent. The atmosphere is pretty nice and the place also seems somewhat cleaner than most Thai restaurants within this budget range. Also, the place claims not to use monosodium glutamate in the dishes and I believe this.Overall, a very good place for bargain-price authentic Thai food  you certainly won't regret coming here (the red curries are slightly preferred to the green curries in my opinion). The owner is a pleasant quiet gentleman called Heiko and the lovely Noki is certainly a delight to chat with. :o)"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/21/14,"Definitely a nice place. Although I don't know thai food well enough to comment on its authenticity, I can say that here it tastes good and there are (almost more than) enough options to choose from on the menu.If you like your food spicy hot - like me - ask for it to be ""thai hot"" and you won't be disapppinted. Also, the staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care each guest feels comfortable. Give this place a try :)"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,11/12/12,"We ended up walking over 45 minutes to find this place (make sure you know where you're going!) but it was well worth the wait and we were glad we burned the calories when our food was served.The waitstaff was hospitable, attentive, (unique for Berlin) and helpful. We felt like we were honored guests as our waiter came to ask us how our meals were going and offer his personal suggestions.The location is cute and comfy, although the limited seating means that there may be a wait if you come at a busy time.Above all, the food was spectacular. Berlin (German, in general) cuisine is not known for their spice but Sarods knows how to layer spices to create a delicious effect in all of the entrees sampled. I would recommend any of the soups (they were all great!) and the pad thai although I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong here!"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,8/28/12,"Hello my fellow Yelpers! Like everyone else, I've been enjoying this fine Berlin summer, but now I'm back!I just returned from place. We ordered the papaya salad, the coconut and shrimp soup, the spicy beef salad with crispy rice, the pad thai, and lastly, the chicken with garlic and chilis.Yes, we're two small people but we can eat like an army.They made everything extra spicy like we asked, and even brought out more chilis when we asked for it!This is out second time here and it definitely won't be our last. Excellent prices, legit northern Thai food, on the same scale as Zab Elee in Manhattan. LOVE THIS!"
Sarod?s Thai Restaurant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,2/23/13,"Well, this is a very authentic Thai restaurant in Kreuzberg, Bergmannkiez.Well, I have eaten the duck salad a few times and have to say that it is one of the best things I have put in to my mouth. It is spicy with all sorts of different flavours that come together very nicely.It can be a bit on the pricey side if you have a large appetite. It's definitely worth it. The staff is very friendly as well."
Abonim,Korean,4,?11-20,5,3/7/14,"Fresh, excellent quality sushi. This place clearly knows what it is doing. Wonderful. I have to give this place credit! I left NY to visit my bf in Pankow and we were seriously in the mood for some sushi. You have to be picky or you will end up for hours in the bathroom, if ya catch my drift.  The sushi here is fresh, fresh, fresh, it is practically still swimming. It is expertly prepared and with a stylish panache. This sushi is so ridiculously good that I made a point to eat here at least once a week. DEFINITELY GO!"
Abonim,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/19/15,BEST KOREAN FOOD IN TOWN...beside all those fashionable Korean Pop Ups around the center...its not to far from the center but worth any minute more it takes you to get there...very friendly staff and DELICIOUS...
Abonim,Korean,4,?11-20,3,12/5/15,"Still a good choice for Sushi nearby, but now it gets too crowded and the tables are standing very close to each other. We feel, that slowly they are losing attention for the details, both about food and the service quality. We had some just very average evenings even. It's not that we won't come back, but now it appears they came down one level."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,11/21/15,"We tried the Korean BBQ and despite the fact,that we were disappointed about not having the chance to choose different meat (Minimum 2 people are necessary for BBQ), quality was okay. But we liked it.They just opened, when we visited the Ssam, so it was obvious that the staff was a little bit insecure.So we will give them a chance, even if we still wait for our promised receipt, they wanted to send us."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,1/19/17,"I came here with my colleague for lunch the other day. It wasn't so many people when we first got here, so we could just pick any seats like. The size of the restaurant is quite alright, don't really feel crowded, even the place was full.I like korean food, especially Bibimbap, so sure I ordered that just to try it. when I saw the menu, there was two options for this,  it didn't seem to have much different, but just one Euro. so we decided to order both to see the different.so the cheaper Bibimbap here turned out to be cold dish. that was quite a surprice for me, since I never really tasted a Cold Bibimbap until then. and the Bibimbap I used to have somehow here need to cost an extra 1 Euro for that. it was kind strange to me. The taste was alright.  The other thing I noticed that they just offered us around 6 very small dishes as starter but for 5 people. That was also quite stange to me. usually the restaurant I've been. they will offer that depend on the number of the people. each person at least will got 3 diches as starter. At the end, I think this place just alright. For me, I prefer the other Korean restaurants around this district."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,4/30/17,"An absolute no go is the fact that you MUST order at least two barbecue dishes! Even though you are alone. Ridiculous. One dish is minimum 16? or so. It's simply raw meat with some vegetables. So you do basically all the cooking.The prices are way too high for average food quality and average service. When we ordered 9 dumplings we got 8. The waitress then took it back, the chef cooked the other dumpling for about 10mins. Result was 8 cold and 1 warm one. Yay!And last but not least they OF COURSE don't accept credit cards. Cash only is a pretty common way to be under the radar of the tax office."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,2,5/18/17,The food of BBQ is nothing special. . The prices is too expensive for what it is. The view is good but a bit dusty
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,11/20/17,"Super expensive and no card payments, in a Korean restaurant (you pay everything by card in Korea)."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,12/15/16,"We ordered BBQ- Beef and Chicken Gabi, comes with rice, wrapping cabbage and 6 side dishes(refilled). Meat was tasteful and soft enough. We also ordered extra soup which has vegetable, shrimp and clam, tastes super good exactly like what I have tried in Korea. Stuffs were nice!"
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,2/21/17,"As a Korean living in Berlin, I was excited to find Ssam for comforting Korean meals. I eat here almost once a week, sometimes twice (I work nearby). I'm a pretty tough critic, but I usually enjoy my experience at Ssam.Starting from the best, So Galbi and Daeji Galbi are very good, really well marinated meats. I love their thick-cut Samgyeopsal (pork belly). Not many Korean restaurants in Berlin have this cut. The pork ribs are really good, but dolsot bibimbap was for me just okay (I have a high standard, my friends love it). Service can be chaotic sometimes, but it's gotten better these days.Despite my criticisms, I will definitely keep going back to Ssam, I'm still just happy I can find good korean food nearby!"
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,1/24/17,Too expensive for what it is. The food is nothing special. After leaving the place u smell like Korean bq for the rest of the night. Super annoying that they don't accept cards!!!!!!!
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,2/6/16,"Went there on Friday night, it was crowded, good that my friend made a reservation in advanced. We ordered BEef Galbi and pork neck for the bbq and kimchi jjigae.. The food was good, and beef galbi is the one I like the most.."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,12/29/15,the location is right next to the U-bahn exit. I visited for lunch time and the food was reasonable. main menu was good but Banchan(side dishes) are a bit disappointing. the service was great.
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,3/29/16,"The BBQ is awesome! The soy-sauce beef was just great, the squid was a bit stale but the prawns and the tuna made up for it. The Kimchi was one of the best I ever had. We went a little overboard and ordered too much even though it's pretty pricy...but it was worth it. However, the service was quite inattentive and not particularly nice to be honest."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,1/2/16,"Carnivores prepare yourselves. Korean bbq, i'm not korean but this seems like the real thing. Beef brisket and beef chops come raw to the table and you grill them to perfection. Pork ribs so lecker. Eat fast and prepare to leave smelling like a yummy slab of smoking fatty juicy flesh."
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,1/31/16,"I belong to those people, who's supporting refugees and migrants in Germany. If you aren't then it's fine with me, but please don't act like an asshole i don't need those ignorance people /restaurant in my neighborhood for sure! Please don't let your ignorance gets impact of your service/foods as well. As an Asian I am ashamed of these people. The food was ok last time but they won't see me and my friendcirle as their guest in future anymore!!!"
Ssam Korean BBQ,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,1/10/16,"The food has been altered for a German or Western palate - blander and watered down. This I found terribly disappointing, but I also recognize my Korean food expectations are way too high, as someone who lived in Los Angeles for a long time and is used to Korean food perfection in Korea-town. We had the samgupsal. The portions were not very generous; too thinly sliced and was served with soy sauce, not sesame oil! That was certainly weird. My only thought was it's probably much cheaper this way, and definitely noted as a weak point. We also ordered spicy ojingah and it wasn't spicy at all! The hamul-pachun (seafood pancake) was yummy though. Probably won't go here again. It's definitely an overpriced hipster joint, but was edible."
Vietbowl,Vietnamese,5,,5,11/16/17,"After trying to enjoy the open air of Klunkerkranich on a miserably cold and drizzly night, our group sought refuge in a warm bowl of pho. Vietbowl delivered. We were seated immediately at a long, wooden table in the middle, as if we had come for a late fall feast. Our server was extremely efficient, swooping in with menus and checking in to make sure we knew what the menus detailed (some in our group did not speak/read German). I ordered the vegan/veggie pho - mushrooms, tofu, thick udon noodles, tons of cilantro and shredded radish. The broth was perfectly balanced. I was afraid it would be salty as usual, but it had enough of a sour kick and not too much salt that I wasn't left gasping for a glass of water (which I would have had to pay for anyway, because this is Europe). The serving size was extremely generous and at only 6.70?, I couldn't have asked for a better meal to share on our last night in Berlin. The restaurant also takes card, tg, and not just EC debit or cash. We also happened to go during the restaurant's opening weekend and each got a 20% discount. Ty vietbowl, you really saved us that night (now please come to Hamburg)."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/28/15,"A vegetarian / vegan Chinese restaurant? What a cool idea. And very well worked out in this case. The food is good to excellent, the decoration is very nice and the service was great, with a young waiter doing an excellent job. You could see that he was loved by the regulars. Our favourite dish was the cauliflower, but the rest was also very nice.Conclusion: Please open a location in Friedrichshain so we can come often!"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,4,2/15/17,"Good!! Nice interior and food. I go very often even its quite far from my place. They have menu ""suan la tang ???"", its good who loves hot spicy food but time to time its bad... ask for more spicy ver. If u  wanna try gooood suan la tang."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,4,2/9/16,"We were lazy last night, so instead of cooking, we opted to find some place near our neighborhood to eat. We stumbled upon this place, even though we were walking on our way to some other location, which, perhaps fortunately, had no place for us. So we walked into this one, asked if they had a free table, and voila, we were seated within minutes.This restaurant is affiliated with the restaurant in our own neighborhood, Tian Fu, and since we knew that was a good choice, I had high hopes for this one. After all, this is quite adventurous: vegetarian and Szechuan. Given that there was a vegetarian constraint in this restaurant, I was impressed with the tasty selections they had. There was a section of the menu where they had alternatives: fake duck, fake meat, and so forth, but even if you don't go there, there are plenty of interesting items one can order. I simply loved the eggplant Yiuxiang-style. We also ordered a bunch of other appetizers (we're those snobby types that think that appetizers are more interesting than main dishes), and since there were quite a bit of eggplant, we opted to take the remainder home.I am withholding a star for logistic reasons: there is a section of the restaurant that can only be reached by climbing the stairs. While we were there, someone tripped, and almost crashed on to another table. It would have been great if they installed handrails, or at least made the steps a little bit more visible. The current paint job of very creamy beige doesn't make it too obvious, and people might miscalculate their steps.Otherwise, this place is great. I'll definitely be back."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/7/15,"What a fantastic restaurant. Great service, the food just out of this world. We got treated by the charming owner to a plateful of vegan calamari. OMG! Just amazing. This place is a must try for all you vegetarians/ vegans and spicy food lovers."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/2/16,"Dear Tianfuzius, Please come to Prenzlauer Berg! We trekked all the way from Prenzlauer Berg to eat here, and boy were we glad we did! We had Xiao Long Bao (Chinese steamed buns), Gebackene Wan Tan mit einer s??-sauren Sauce (fried Wan Tans with sweet and sour sauce), Tofutopf nach Sichuan-Art (Spicy Sichuan Tofu Stew) and Vegetarisches Gongbao Huhn mit Erdn?ssen (Vegetarian Gungbao\Kung Po Chicken with peanuts) - every item was delicious to outstanding! My non-vegetarian friend loved the dim sum more than anything and I savoured every interestingly different tasting bite of the tofu stew that left my taste buds in awe! The dim sum portions were small but the entrees were big, especially the stew! The service was nice and the restaurant interiors were lovely. Prices are fair for the quality of the food, portion sizes and location. I highly recommend it!"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/24/17,"My hubby and I were visiting Berlin and it was Christmas eve, with almost no restaurants open. We were starving and thankfully Thai Window Asia was open. The chef was friendly and kind. We ordered the spring rolls and matsaman curry with tofu. Both the dishes were extremely good. Thai cuisine is one of the favorite cuisines of our family and we enjoyed this place. This is handled by a single guy and he cooks very well (and you can see him cooking right in front of you). This is definitely a must try if you are around the area."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,3,9/8/17,"The food is not that bad but this is a one guy shop and you have to wait ages before you get your food. He makes it in batches so if you are alone, you might end up waiting for a pretty long time. I have been here twice before and as I write this review, I have kinda decided that it's my last time here."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/1/16,"Awesome food. They had really tasty thai food and lots of beverage options.  I got the hot medicinal dish with duck. Trust them when they say it's hot. It's very hot. We also got the dish with fruits, and I would totally  recommend it.The service was fast and precise. They only have 3 tables, so it might be full depending on the hour.As said in other comments, this is really a pearl on the middle of downtown Berlin. Would totally go there again.The only reason that I'm taking out one star is because the kitchen is open to the public. Some people might find it cool and Interesting to see they make it in front of your eyes, but smoke from the food comes to the common room."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/8/16,"The most authentic tasting Thai food I've had in my active search through 15+ Thai joints of all strata. The green curry actually had the mini eggplants like in Thailand! Service was pleasant and friendly, both from the owner/cook and the sole waitress. The wontons were far meatier than the average, and I had a great Bier brand bier. Yes, I wrote that correctly."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/10/15,"Do you want delicious Thai food? Go here! I am so happy I found this place. I ordered number 29 - veggies and tofu with medicinal herbs. This is seriously hot! It'll blow your face off! IT IS DELICIOUS. If you can handle heat, order this. The gentlemen that makes all the food has a small kitchen and everything is made to order. Place is super clean, feels like home, and I will be back."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/30/16,"Great tasting, authentic Thai food at a great price! I got the red curry and the BF got the green curry. Both dishes were under ?10.00 each, which is quite a steal! Terribly understaffed though. As a previous Yelper mentioned, there was only one waitress. Though friendly, she left shortly after seating us and taking our orders, leaving just the owner to run the restaurant. This poor guy had to work the kitchen and tend to customers as they walked in (and the restaurant gathered some new seaters rather quickly). Took over 40 minutes to get our orders out, but considering there was only one man running the restaurant who still managed to get our food tasting great, I find this pretty acceptable.If you're a tourist from the States, as was I, here are a few things to take notice of:1) There is no air conditioning in the restaurant. Either that or they didn't bother turning it on. I am not familiar with Berlin's typical weather forecast, but we were there in late June on a hot summer day, so we found this to be a rather unpleasant dining environment (then again, maybe we are just overly spoiled here in America with our air conditioning).2) Because there is no air conditioning, the entry door is left open for ventilation. This led to flies constantly flying in and buzzing around our food. Again, not a pleasant dining environment!3) If you didn't already know, water is not typically served complimentary in European countries! We started with two waters (served to us in little plastic cups ~6oz), and each got a refill. When we went to check out, we were told that the waters were ?1.80 each! Quite a rip for such a small amount of water. Tip: bring your own water/drinks if you choose to dine in.If based solely on the food itself, I would give this place a solid 5/5. I originally took off 2 stars for the hygiene and the long waiting period, but decided to take off 1 star only, because I respect the crap out of the owner for working so hard."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/19/16,"The food was delicious and comforting on a cold night, and at a very reasonable price. The aesthetic was simple and cozy. The man cooking was also the business owner and he was very kind, too. I will be happy to support his business if I come back to Berlin."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/8/16,"I ate here the other day, had the red curry with duck. At ?8.50 it's not a bad price, but not great either. The food itself was just okay. The cut of duck I had wasn't great. Overly fatty and tough to eat. The curry sauce was okay, veggies were okay (cut up a bit to small for my liking). I wanted this place to be really good so I had a quick easy place to get to for lunch, but the one sampling it was just average, and the place isn't nice enough to inspire me to come back. I may try it again at some point, but there are better (as well as much worse) options around."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/21/15,"Total hidden gem! Came to Thai Window Asia after looking at the ridiculous prices of touristy type restaurants in the area. Walked in and sat down in the upstairs back area. Ordered the Lemongrass green tea (delicious on a cold, snowy day), Thai Coconut soup was absolutely amazing and would definitely recommend! The hot and sour soup seemed to have a different soup base than what we were use to (tomato-y), but still delicious. Ordered green curry and the red curry. Definitely enjoyed both, but preferred the red over green. Absolutely stop here and grab a bite to eat :)"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/24/15,"Authentic thai food with all the classic dishes that you know and love, and very modestly priced. You come here to enjoy excellent thai food just like in Thailand. I personally recommend the king prawn Tom yum soup as a starter and the green curry with prawns as a main. It's more than enough food, rich with nutrients, and will cost ya under ?12. Can't lose!"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,3,11/6/15,"After I heard this would be an authentic Thai place, I went to try. Well... It was authentic German-Thai, if there is such a thing. The same crispy duck dishes as everywhere else. Main dishes are served on one big plate so that there's no chance to enjoy the rice nor the dish by itself. Not spicy at all. Everything was much too watery. No Thai drinks like ice tea. Instead, Mango Lassi... I guess the flavors are okay, and most (but not all) of the dishes are actually ones you would get in Thailand."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,6/14/15,"This place is so friendly and authentic. Unfortunately not everyone could get what they ordered since they didn't have all the ingredients and there was only one guy working that day for 2 large groups. Seriously delicious and great option when looking for some tasty thai food. They have some great asian beers also and I would never have come here if I hadn't read on yelp and heard about this place from a friend. Pass on the word, this place is delicous!"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/22/14,A cozy place to try far East kitchen. You have opportunity to look over to the small kitchen where your meal is being cooked!
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/12/14,"This place is a small hidden gem. There are 2 reasons why I have 4 stars and not 5.1. The dishes are a bit small2. They were out of a lot of dishes because of a busy dayThe sauces are amazing and rich. Prices are great. Service is goodWorth a visit if you're nearby"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/25/15,"Amazing Thai food!The atmosphere was intimate and cozy. There was only one person running the restaurant but the food came out fairly quickly and burning hot, which is how I like my food. He was extremely nice even after I accidentally spilled my beer. My partner had the hot and sour soup. Probably the best and sour soup we've ever tried! I'm coming back for that one. I had the  Tom Kha Gai soup with chicken and veggies soup which was also delicious. The chicken was so tender and the veggies were fresh. For our main course we shared the only noodles on the menu. Flavorful with lots of veggies and the perfect chewy texture. We got our Thai fix for sure. Sorry there are no pics we just dug into our food because it looked too good :)"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,1,2/15/16,"Went here for lunch today, hoping for some soup. Waited more than 20 minutes to have my order taken, only to be told he wasn't making soup because ""it takes too long"". I realize this is a one guy shop, but this is unacceptable. If you aren't going to serve everything on your menu, at least warn your guests, especially if you are going to make them wait so long to order. Huge waste of time for no food."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,6/10/15,"The food was delicious, with aromatic herbs and tasty sauces. The portions look small but I think can fill you at the end. As u walk in, there is a second room with an amazing small balcony for two. Great for some summer evening!Worth to visit overall"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/19/14,"Great cosy place with authentic Thai food, especially superb pad kee mao. The only thing you should consider is that there is only one guy cooking and serving about six tables, so you should either call in advance and pre-order or have a lot of time, if you're not the first one to arrive."
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/31/15,"pretty nice for a cheap thai meal, will definitely recommend the obst curry (fruit curry)"
Thai Window Asia,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/8/15,"This is my go-to Thai in Berlin Mitte. Unpretentious and, on the best days, fabulous. The man is a gifted chef, really. The fact he does it all by himself leaves him vulnerable to off days. Even then, though, it's still never less than excellent."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,4/14/17,"I'm always super confused after eating at Mammam because their curry bowls don't look super small but I end up in a food coma every time.I have to admit: I only come here for the curry and order it with the rice noodles because I deserve it. There are different curries (with lychee, mango, peanut or sweet potato). Every dish is well composed and comes with some fresh lettuce.Since the venue is super small I recommend to avoid the rush hours around 18:00 - 19:00 or give them a call before hand.I would eat here every day if it's closer to my place! NICE!"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,1/31/17,"I must say, there has been times where the food was very fresh and delicious. Then others where the beef in the pho tasted awful and the broth must have been sitting around for days.Stay away from the signature fried rolls, they are oily and everything but crispyI love their jasmine tea that comes free with lunch and the daily specials are usually good."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,1,8/21/16,"We ordered take-out twice from here (we believe in second chances, I guess). The food is ""ok"". I just wish that they would use somewhat watertight containers for very saucy items. That stuff gets in everything. And I wish that they knew the difference between rice and noodles. Each dish they say comes with your choice of rice or noodles. The first time we ordered from them, we chose noodles. They gave us rice. The second time we ordered from them, we specified noodles many many times - for each dish and then at the end ""noodles for everything"" in German and in English. I mean, you can't get clearer than that, can you? They were very rude to my husband when he went to pick up - didn't want to give him the change for the order.  Then as he attempted to check the order, they very rudely told him he can't do that at the counter and told him to get out. So he came home and sure enough - RICE instead of noodles. Not planning to give them a 3rd chance."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,10/3/15,"It is certainly nice to be in a place that hasn't been all fancied up yet, where you can look over the counter and find everyone busy preparing meals with care. The menu is good, lots of choices, and surely some gems among them. However, as far as Vietnamese in the context of Berlin, there are far superior places and admitedly it has become a very competitive field. This is my first forray into Friedrichshain Vietnamese/Thai choices but it does not hold a candle to places in P-Berg and Neukoln. I had the red curry with Lychee, interesting idea and decently executed. summer rolls had nothing to do with Vietnamese summer rolls, but what do I know, Im just a westerner addicted to what a decade of Vietnamese restaurants have given me. So all in all, a good place, modest in a wonderful way. But there are better out there."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,8/15/14,"When I'm hungry and don't know what to eat - Vietnamese is mostly my first options, it's really hard to go wrong with it.So I was hungry and needed some food while wandering around Boxi, found this little restaurant and thought I might give it a chance, boy, was I not disappointed! This place is AWESOME! The menu is quite diverse, the place however is really small, we sat outside and enjoyed the weather. For starters we took fried summer rolls with chicken- unlike most of the places, you can choose 2 dips out of the 4 they suggest... Came out pretty fast and tasted great! For a main dish I had fried chicken in spicy red curry that tasted absolutely wonderful, also, the dish was huge and even though I was hungry I could barely finish it.The person who served us was really nice and overall it was a really good experience and I'm coming back again for sure to try out some more stuff!"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,6/15/16,"if you're a vegan visiting or living in berlin this place is a must! the prices are great and there are many options for different diets. I ordered number 17d (Massaman Curry S??kartoffel) with Tofu... the portion was large, it came with salad and rice... a perfect pari for the curry, tofu, vegetables, and potatoes. the service is great too!"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,1,8/20/16,"Been to this place a few times and was always amazed by the extremely bad service. This time was even worse. The waiter played on me a cheap trick when I ordered a small drink and received a big one instead in order to make me pay more (ordered in German so it's really hard to confuse). Ordered a dish and asked with no Onion. I received it with onion of course. When I told the waiter he said ""Just take it out with the fork"". Also my friend didn't receive her drink at all. Horrible. Not going there again."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,8/28/16,"Came here because of the good reviews. Were quite disappointed though! Don't know why this place is rated 4.5 stars. We ordered summer rolls (divided into 4 peaces each even though we asked them not to cut them... was sticking to the plate like nothing good plus they were below average), glasnoodle salad, a vegan rice noodle dish and two of the daily dishes. DONT EVER ORDER THEIR DAILY DISHES. Especially do not let yourself fool by the double baked duck. I think there is only one reason why it's double baked...Maybe their other dishes are far better. Or maybe we just had bad luck...but don't think we'll go there ever again."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/20/15,"Seriously delicious Vietnamese food. It doesn't have a fancy decor - but the Mekong sharing platter of hot & cold spring rolls, the mango salad and Tom Yum soup - were SO GOOD.It is also very cheap and all tables are served by one waiter (who was quite efficient!)"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,6/19/15,"Very nice place to have real vietbamese pho or salad , with great deal lunch offer. Service is also really nice and all food is glutamat free , which is essential to my food ethics.My fav Vietnanese rest. In Friedrichshain."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/15/14,"Don't be dissuaded by the quite small seating area and the ""take-out"" flair. The food at this place is legit! You can expect close to authentic asian food (not that easy to find in Berlin or Germany for what it's worth) and efficient service at a great price. I had the Pho with beef which was flavorful and fragrant. I asked for fresh chili's and was handed chili's and a pair of scissors - just like I'd do it at home. Kudos to the waiter! My girlfriend had the days special - Tofu with mixed vegetables in peanut sauce and she was pleasantly surprised. The Vegetables where crunchy and the sauce creamy without being overly fatty or oily. She was very happy with her dish (and me too, as I could steal a bite or two). I can also wholeheartedly recommend the summer rolls: Crunchy fried prawns, fresh salad and comforting noodles all wrapped together and ready for the provided dipping sauces. Delicious! Tl;dr version: I can't recommend this place enough. Tasty food at a reasonable price. Just go there already. You'll thank me later."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,4/2/15,"Really good vietnamese food, really cheap and very friendly people. This is a small restaurant but there are around four to five tables there. Seems like a lot use it for take away. But we stayed and had the best vietnamese food for the weekend here."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,12/30/13,"Simple and tasty good food! This is no gourmet, but you can't really expect that in this low price range. We had a tasty lunch with drinks for two and spent 18?.There are some cold dishes that you might expect to be warm. So ask to be sure."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,11/28/13,"Great food, terrible service.I've been there two or three times, because the food is tasty and portions large (and, like many place in Berlin, prices cheap), but the service has always been poor. The guy just doesn't seem like he likes his job."
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,9/15/13,"Das Mammam bietet super leckere Gerichte zu g?nstigen Preisen an. Ich war hier bereits mehrfach mit Freunden und Familie essen und war jedes Mal sehr zufrieden. Die Bedienung ist freundlich, die K?che schnell und das Essen frisch, gut portioniert und sehr schmackhaft. Laut Freunden, die durch S?dostasien gereist sind, soll das Essen weitestgehend authentisch sein. Fragw?rdig ist die Beschallung mit 80er-Jahre Musik, die hier manchmal gespielt wird. Vor ein paar Wochen konnten wir neben dem Essen eine asiatische Variante von Deutschland sucht den Superstar im TV bewundern  das war wesentlich am?santer und irgendwie passender. Einen Stern Abzug gibt es f?r die Sauberkeit der Tische und die ungem?tlichen Sitzhocker. Es handelt sich hier aber eben auch eher um einen Imbiss als um ein Restaurant, in dem man lange verweilt. Ich werde auf jeden Fall f?r eines der leckeren Gerichte wieder kommen!"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,6/30/15,This is really ok.  It is not the most authentic Vietnamese I've eaten but not bad for the German take on Vietnamese food.  I've definitely paid more for worse.  I had the Ph? which was herbed & spiced enough to have an ok flavour.  Love that there is fresh chilli on he table!  The meat wasn't the best quality but edible.  I'd come back here again for a Ph?
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,8/30/12,"Exzellente leichte und Gesunde K?che zu kleinstem Preis.Meine besondere Empfehlung: der Mangosalat"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,3/14/12,"I will definitely go back whenever I am in the neighbourhood. After a few disappointing asian/fusion food experiences recently, it was a relief to finally have a decent, well made, super tasty Vietnamese meal. I had vietnamese noodles with peanutbutter sauce, veggies and tofu. The peanutbutter sauce was just perfect in my opinion. The noodles could have been cooked slighlyt shorter, but they were still fine. The staff is friendly and speaks very good English (menu also in English), it is a nice and clean environment, and the prices are really good. I can't find a reason not to go there!"
Mammam Gark?che,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,8/7/12,"Pretty good and pretty cheap. I'm a fan!  slightly more rice with the curries would be an improvement, it's very curry heavy."
Kien-Du-Kiang-Thong,Thai,4,?11-20,1,7/15/16,"Very expensive value for money! We order a pad Thai with prawns, no prawns but chopped shrimps. We Also ordered chicken red curry, few pieces of chicken with lots vegetables in a small bowl We walked in late so got a nice window table and people came for the next table, we had not ordered yet and they gave our menu card to the next table!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/16/15,"Excellent food and staff! I had the spring rolls, the number 16 (I think bo mac chau maybe), and mango fridge. All of it was so delicious and cheap!The location was excellent as well, especially for tourists because there are a number of bars/pubs/beer gardens around. I will definitely be coming back here!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/22/17,"""Another Vietnamese place ?"" is what you won't hear me saying about Vietnam Village. Their interior design is smooth and homey (maybe authentic, well probably not but it`s a good sign I might think it is).The food is classic Vietnamese food such as Crispy duck in red curry sauce which has everything you want if you?re in the mood for some Vietnamese. My personal favourite is the ""Wok-fried Beef in Noodle Pho"" the way they spice the beef and seasoned the chicken broth is amazing. Another plus is that they have an open kitchen where you can watch  youre food being prepared freshly every day."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/6/17,"Best Vietnamese in town! Large variety of amazingly fresh and delicious food. I especially loved the big choice of fresh fruit shakes and drinks. They taste like summer! The staff is extremely friendly and quick, especially Vuong. He was so considerate and patient throughout the whole time. Definitely worth going to!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/25/15,"I am a big fan of Vietnamese food, but I am generally used to a very simple decor. Not the Vietnam Village! One gets the fancy decor AND affordable prices.Since I was in Prenzlauer Berg that day, I searched for an inexpensive Vietnamese restaurant and came across this one. Due to the great and affordable rating I decided to give it a try. When I drove by I could not believe that the ""low price"" rating could possibly be true. And was a bit intimidated to go in, as it looked really fancy from the outside. The decor and the restaurant itself looks really ""Feng Shui"" like from the outside. I was greeted by the waiter when I stepped in and shown to a table. The decor is warm, the atmosphere classy and yet super relaxed. Upon receiving the menu, I was truly surprised how affordable the food was. So, the reviews were really justified. The place has a very comfortable vibe and the eyes wanders around the entire room. It is def. an eye candy.The food came out fairly quickly and tasted qualitatively good. We ordered two small pho (choice of chicken or beef) for EUR 2.50 and a summer roll (choice of chicken or shrimp) for EUR 1.90. The waiter was nice and attentive and took our order. Since I was there with my 5-year old he even brought out a fork for the noodles in her pho without asking. That is what I call great customer service! I was there on an early Saturday evening/late afternoon and the place was not crowded but I can see that this place can get packed on the weekends. It is a nice place to take your friends out on a Friday or Saturday night for a low-budget dining experience. It is kids friendly because as we were there another young family came in with their young son, who had a kids walking bike with him. The waiter accommodated them including the little walking bike and joked around with the little kid. He was also very sweet with my daughter.So, I agree with all the great reviews and will be back soon! Highly recommended."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/24/15,"Cool Vietnamese place in p.berg with one of the best summer rolls I've had.Sat here with a friend from out of town on a nice sunny day, we took advantage of the nice weather and sat outside.so we started with some summer rolls, which came stuffed in lots of veggies, herbs ,yummy fried tofu and a tasty sauce.The main dishes came not too long after - I've had a chicken curry with veggies which was pretty good... There's a salad and rice on the side as well.The menu is pretty diverse and there is a lot to choose from.This street corner is packed with good places and a great urban atmosphere. The service is good and the prices are fair, I'd recommend spending a nice sunny afternoon, and if the weather is not too nice it's pretty nice inside too, so no worries!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/17/16,Very good service and sent food promptly. Authentic Vietnamese food and drinks with reasonable price. Highly recommended for lunch.
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/13/13,"This really is a little gem of a Vietnamese restaurant, the prices are low, and the veggies are market crisp and fresh. That combo is rare to come by - so no wonder why this place is always packed. The poor waitress is running around like crazy..Everything on the menu looks great, and I can endorse both the summer rolls, as well as the fish and veggie curries. Kudos for using organic sweet potato. The mango lasso is a delight, while their take on the mohito is a bland affair.The only big drawback, and BIG  it is.. there's now vegetarian pho on the menu! What's up with that??? If I'm lucky they'll put it on the daily specials board one of these days.."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/11/13,"This canteen-style place has always been packed each time I've been. Absolutely loved the added touch of the faux chicken coops hanging off the tree outside, giving it an authentic village feel ha. Lots of outdooe seating available and on a warm summer evening such a great atmosphere. The first time I came here I had something off their weekly specials menu, the Lemongrass Chicken Bun noodles with the Vietnamese Spring rolls to start. Service was quick and efficient despite it being busy. The rolls were crispy and the portion size was generous considering it was a bargainous 2,50EUR. The Chicken Bun noodles were also delicious, the rice noodles just right and not soggy, veggies nice and crisp and again a huge portion size for under 7EUR. A meal for 2 for under 20EUR! WHAT!!! Such good value, this would almost never happen in London! My only qualm is that the dipping sauce/nuoc cham could have been spicier or at least the option given to me to make it spicy, but I guess that it has been toned down to suit the German tastebuds maybe?!  Nevertheless a great little gem, will definitely be back!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,5/16/15,Food was very tasty. Chicken a bit dry. Poor service. Waited 25 minutes for food. The waiter forgot one of the starters which came with the main course anyway...
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/2/15,"Great food, good price, good ambient. My favorite viet place in Berlin."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/25/14,"My first dinner in Berlin was a keeper! I had vegetarian spring rolls and red fish in garlic sauce. All was delicious, piping hot, flavorful but not too spicy. And the cost was very, very reasonable. I would without a doubt go back!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/10/14,"Yes, there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Berlin now and I am sure there are many good ones.For me Vietnam Village is one of the best I went  to in Berlin.  I  especially love to go there in summer when you can sit outside .  The food is always tasty and it is not expensive.I was in Vietnam myself, so I am able to compare.  I thought the food is really authentic and I also love their different juices and teas.  I recommend!"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/5/14,"Our most favourite Vietnam restaurant in Berlin! The food is always amazing, the vegetables are always fresh and... let?s say... ""al dente"" :-D and I love it! And the prices are also very budget-friendly! The best idea is to visit this restaurant during warm months when you can sit outside."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/19/12,"Vietnam Village opened about a year ago and it has become my husbands favorite on the street. The food is really fresh and tasty, the prices are reasonable and the service is easy."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/8/13,"We spent a week in Berlin and I went 3 times to Vietnam Village as I love the food. It's fresh, tasty and inexpensive. Plus they are open all day so easy to have food after you did your sightseeing tour. I found the service very friendly and helpful even asked them if they could open another restaurant near my home..still working on it."
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/7/11,Very fresh and tasty Vietnamese food. Had better abroad but among the best I had in Berlin.
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/27/13,"Nice atmosphere, fresh vegetables and tasty food, plus the prices are ready good"
Vietnam Village,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/7/12,"Mein totales Lieblingsrestaurant! Bin bis zu 4 Mal die Woche hier. Deshalb kennen sie mich und wissen ganz genau, was ich gerne esse. Die Bedienung ist sehr freundlich und Man erz?hlt sich schon tolle Geschichten und quatscht einfach mal ne Weile miteinander. Es ist so nett und die Atmosph?re ist einfach toll! Und das Essen!!! Oh Gott! Ich kenne keinen besseren Vietnamesen in Berlin. Soooooo guuuut!!! Jedem zu empfehlen."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,9/9/17,"This is my new favourite vietnamese restaurant, the food was well priced and delicious, the atmosphere is nice with both tables and floor seating, as well as an outside option, and the service was so nice. The appetizer soups are a perfect size, and the food was really impeccable."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,2,1/7/18,"The food is okay, service is not very good, ambiance is nice. I ordered ""grilled fish"" which was absolutely NOT grilled. It was pan fried smothered in mango sweet sauce. I asked for the sauce on the side, didn't happen. When it was time for the check, I first gestured the universal sign of putting your hand up with fingers mimicking holding a fake pen and the signing gesture while mouthing ""the check please"".  The waiter comes up to me and starts discussing about how I should be ableto afford my meal. It should not be expensive, do I have cash on me? ... And is refusing to just bring the check until I went to management. The owner/manager doesn't speak English so he said 'sorry,' understood something made me unhappy. I paid my bill and left. I was dressed in sweats and had a backpack with me, so the waiter must have prejudged me, I can only assume, though my cloths were clean and my hair groomed. It was very insulting and I'll never be back to this place."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/3/16,"We always wanted to try this place and finally did. So happy! Great service. Food came out fast and it was delicious. Nice, big portions for great value. The atmosphere is lovely. Duck was cooked perfectly in a mango curry sauce with vegetables underneath. The only thing about the beef bowl was that there was too much sauce at the bottom. But it still tasted amazing.Had to come back. Even better the second time!"
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/24/17,Very nice and authentic place! Loved the food. Staff was very friendly as well - overall definitely worth a visit!
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,2,1/18/16,"New Day is the climate more exclusive vietnamese cafeteria.Not convinced me this place at all, especially since you're after a visit steeped in the smell of the kitchen.Be careful, because you can get a dish of another table. Staff is one big chaos, they never know who ordered what. Prices a little too high for what they represent.I know better places."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,3,5/8/15,"Spacious and calm. With a typical berlin ambiance in the outside seating. Nothing complicated, just straight forward, decent Vietnamese.Appetizer: spring rolls with shrimp were okay. Nothing special. Rather tasteless lime dressing with no kick.Daily special: tofu with ginger sauce. Doused in the delicious sauce were fried tofu, nuts, onion, corn, heaps of coriander. Served with a big portion of rice. Very fragrant and fulfilling. This made my 3 stars."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,3,11/17/16,"The food was ok, not as great as expected and not as fresh as for example  in Hamy or Pho Phan. Would not go back there since there are way better Vietnamese restaurants."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/2/16,"Great place, tasty food. The mango milkshake is awesome. The mango curry duck and pho was great as well. Nice atmosphere, nice staff. Recommended."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/17/16,"Very good and fresh Vietnamese food, well designed, good service and very good value for money. We will come back."
New Day,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/25/14,We enjoyed two vegetarian dishes sitting outside watching people walking by on a warm spring night. The food selection is large and the quality is very good. You get plenty and thus will be satisfied without getting the heavy feeling after eating too much. Prices are reasonable and service was very friendly.
Krua Thai,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,8/15/12,"A very good place! Very friendly and authentic thai. The food was great, fresh and tasty! If you want, you can watch how they make it. Drinks are not expensive at all. I will definitely go there again. Highly recommended!"
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,8/14/16,"I love this place so much. I mean where else can you find a great plate of Thai food for just 5?!? Pad Thai is always on point and so are their curry dishes. The place is a bit small, but that makes it feel more authentic and homey. Definitely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood for some cheap and good food."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,2/23/16,"Authentic cheap and delicious thai food in Neuk?lln. The place is super teeny tiny so I did a take-out because it was soooo packed at 6pm. Food is around ?5-8 and the appetizer is around ?3-4. The service was ok. You place an order, pay (cash only) and get the food when she calls your order"
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,8/18/17,Not quite sure what the fuss is about. It is mediocre Thai - heavy on the fish sauce and salt. It is a good price but really not worth it end the end
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,11/22/16,"Love this place! It's sometimes a battle to get a table in the very limited space, but the food is great and brings me back here often."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,8/23/16,"The best Thai food I've ever had in my life. The red curry with tofu is amazing. It comes with rice, no salad. Service is suspiciously quick, probably not very fresh but I don't really care because it's incredibly satisfying."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,7/16/15,"Went last year around four times for eat-in and takeaway, once this week. This is a great little Thai for comfort food and takeaway, the red curry and tinten salad are our usual choices - but don't expect eat-in dishes to arrive at the same time! If you're a lychee fan, make sure to grab one of their lychee canned drinks from the fridge."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,9/24/15,"I probably come here once a week.  This place is just nice tasting, thai food which feels like it's coming from your own personal thai aunties.Pad Thai is a classic, a little too saucy sometimes but still tastes great!Pad Wann Senn is nice, definitely something you gotta be in the mood for, worth trying out if you haven't had it beforeTheir curries are all delicious, you can't go wrong with those.  I've tried Pa Naeng and the Green curry.  Both absolutely delicious."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,12/29/15,ultimate thai food with super cheap price. I come here once or twice a week.
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,7/6/14,"I am extremely happy I came across this place today!!!! I tried the red curry with chicken and although I like the sauce to be thickened a bit more, it was excellent!!! It was just spicy enough, for 5?. This is definitely my new favourite Thai place and just a 20 minute ride on the Bus 104, passing Tempelhofer Feld.Why pay double the price when this will do very well indeed???? As everyone else has mentioned, this is an Imbiss (take-away) and very little seating space is available. I cannot wait to go back again and try their other dishes, such as pa naeng curry, Pad Thai, green curry, etc. It's not the best Thai I have ever had but considering the price, taste, freshness, etc., it's definitely one of the top places."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,7/18/16,"a very cute small place, vegan friendly and very cheap!! the food was great and very filling!"
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,9/30/14,"The food is all that matters, so ignore the tiny cluttered restaurant and the stern-looking ladies cooking and serving: this is excellent Thai food. And when they say something is hot, they mean actually hot, not ""German-hot"" which is definitely not. I'm already debating what to try next time and working out how long it will take to traverse the entire menu."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,8/25/14,Ordered Pad Thai with tofu. Received heaven on a plate. Husband had Pad Thai with shrimp and he was also very happy with his meal. Stop in! Very very reasonable prices!
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,6/7/15,"this local favourite isn't the best thai you'll ever eat (i hope), but it's reasonably authentic, cheap and without fuss. great place for a quick meal."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,9/9/11,"Not really a sit-down restaurant, more like a small takeaway or street food place.  The ladies who work here are the best.  Five of us came in right near their closing time, but they were welcoming, friendly, and joked around with us.  Portions are huge, prices are cheap, and it was all delicious.  Don't come expecting your favorite Thai specialty; the noodle and curry dishes were generic stir fry style with your choice of meat (for instance, you won't get the rad na or pad see ew you were craving, but you can get rice noodles or egg noodles tossed with veggies and meat)."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,2/6/14,"Teeny tiny hole-in-the-wall that is easy to miss, but worth the visit.  It's nearly like being served in their home, as there are only a couple tables in there and only a few dish choices.  I asked for spicy though, and I got SPICY.  As many expats know, this is a rarity in Berlin.  It's not the best Thai I've ever had, but the curries are cheap and decent."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,6/26/11,"It doesn't get much more genuine than this little Thai gem. The curries and stirfries are EUR5 or EUR6, which makes this the perfect lazy mid-week dinner. And they've an English menu if you're new to German."
Mae Charoen,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,11/20/12,"So good. Very authentic. Eat there all the time. Although, to be fair, I found the pad Thai a bit disappointing. Stick to the curries! Mmmm.."
Show Me - Teppanyaki,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,7/23/17,"Super nice restaurant for special Chinese cuisine. And no mention the performance, super! Very nice staffs ?can't wait to go there again!"
Show Me - Teppanyaki,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,1/3/17,"Cozy and friendly place.  We started with the wonton soup and also ordered some of the dumplings. All was very tasty and freshly made. Also, they had a very good tea selection.  Very happy I found this place in my neighborhood."
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,5,11/30/17,I've spent only several day in Berlin but I eat at least 4 times if tomorrow I still have lunch there. Quite good taste as Boss is from Nanjing where I studied. Enjoy the noodles!
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,1,9/2/17,"Ok, if you love me, please don't come here!!Bad service, average food and way overpriced.Anything around is a better choice.How can you serve bad rice? Its hard to mess the rice but still they managed todo it.Also dim sum here is bought from the supermarket."
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,1,9/2/17,"Dim-Sum are clearly supermarket bought. Service is extremely slow and cold. The tea is very low quality but priced at 5 euros for a very small pot they say would be for 2 pers.after 40min wait i've got my main course order wrong, a different dish was brought to the table.there's also a hotel in the same building and tourists with luggages keep flowing through the restaurant room.would not recommend.plus, its the only restaurant that manages somehow to serve bad rice, very sticky and tasteless."
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,1,4/17/15,"Went to check out this place after it came highly recommended & ranked by some alongside some very good Berlin Chinese restaurants such as Shianiu's House of Noodles in Wilmsersdorf & Asia Deli in Seestr.It's up to 2x the cost of those places and the food was almost inedible. Tasteless and zero chilli even in Szechuan dishes famed for their chilli content (and listed on the menu as 'sehr scharf').  Most of the dim sum seemed to be of the store bought frozen variety and came served with sweet chilli sauce.. Even the jasmine tea was bad, much too strong. Couldn't even finish the food and left hungry. Particularly unfriendly guy serving seemed irritated with us for no apparent reason.. No 'bitte' no 'danke' no 'bon appetite' and well: no tip for you buddy.Totally unacceptable quality, price & service. If you want decent Chinese food go to Shaniu's or Asia Deli."
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,2,5/17/15,"If only the service was as good as the food.My partner and I had to wait a good half hour between his meal and mine. We were warned that the 'vegetables were cooked fresh' and 'may take a while to arrive'!One meal came and half an hour later, the second came.It's not a great thing when the waiting staff sit on the next table with friends smoking with friends whilst 'one of us' is trying to eat their meal either! We were sitting outside. but still.A shame because the food was good but won't go again.."
Shan-Shan,Chinese,3.5,Under ?10,5,2/5/15,"Super solid Chinese food. I had the seaweed salad to start and then the twice cooked pork (fried, roasted, ???) and they were both excellent. The decor and signage on the exterior are a bit weird, but who cares. The food is wonderful."
Son Kitchen,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/7/17,"Very tasty food! This spot is cute and modern. Staff was nice and the portions were a good normal size. I do wish they had a few more standing tables though. For me and my husband's big order we got a tiger ball, kimchi tacos, supreme burger (I think?), homemade green lime tea, and lime soda. Everything was delicious and warm. I think we'll come back here next time we're in town."
Son Kitchen,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/9/17,"Been to this stand several times (and it's super dangerous because it's only across the street) and I have to say that it is delicious!! The reputation that they are making is well deserved! The staff is always cool. The supreme burger is so amazing and the bibimbap is super lecker and the tiger ball is definitely worth cheating on your diet for. Sadly, can't say the same thing about the KFC sandwich. It was lukewarm and the bun was chewy and the chicken was way too small to fit the enormous bun that it was on. Other than that, you've got to try this place. It's awesome!!"
Son Kitchen,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/4/17,Good inexpensive food. Was very happy to see them cater at Cisco Live! It really made the night!
Son Kitchen,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/12/17,My friends and I got take out there and it was absolutely delicious! I had the supreme Burger which tasted great. Fluffy and fresh brioche buns and really tasty meat. My friends had the vegetarian bibimbap and one which was served with honey BBQ beef. Very fresh and large portion sizes.
Deli House,Dim Sum,3.5,Under ?10,4,7/2/17,"The place might not be beautiful or nice, but the food is really good and cheap for the quality. We had dim sum, duck crepes and then beed szechuan and lamb with cumin. All very tasty and the meat was very tender. If it weren't for the slightly 'cheap' decor and the waiter in shorts I'd even give 5 stars."
Deli House,Dim Sum,3.5,Under ?10,4,2/24/17,"I really like this place.  Fresh and authentic Chinese cuisine.  You won't find sushi here.  Cause sushi is japanese not chinese.  Most every asian restaurant in berlin tries to do it all instead of choosing a cuisine and doing it right. Service is friendly and efficient.  Space is cozy.  Prices are just right.  I have been here a few times and have liked most every dish."
Deli House,Dim Sum,3.5,Under ?10,4,2/6/16,"Went there several times for lunch break..  Overall the food there were good, my favorite one is the beef noodles..Good price for lunch break.."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,2/21/16,"I really enjoyed this place. The food was lovely and delicious, and not too terribly pricey. I would say don't go here during the lunch hour if you're in a hurry, though, because they did seem understaffed for a very full restaurant. I had the papaya salad (nice and crunchy, spicy, and funky) as well as the red curry tofu. Both were delicious. I would say the curry was a little more watery than I'm used to but the flavor was excellent. The amount of rice they gave me was enough to feed a small army--I hope they didn't just waste it after I ate about 1/4 of it!"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,11/18/17,"Hmmm, how do I give zero stars?   Food was so so and if I based purely on that, might have been a 3 star.  The wait staff is so rude, I was truly appalled. I guess they really do not like tourists visiting, which I am all too happy to abide by.  There are way too many great restaurants in Berlin to waste time, or money on such a miserable excuse of a Thai restaurant and the bad tempered, low substandard waitstaff.  It's truly alarming that a restaurant with such poor service and mediocre food can survive. Enter at your own peril."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,9/24/17,Probably not the best Thai food in Berlin and service is REALLY slow.  Waiter and hostess both were very rude and unfortunately for them I speak Thai and the terrible things they were saying about their customers were appalling. :o(. I ordered a Mojito which tasted like a club soda with limes in it and they totally ignored us after a large party came in.  For dinner I had the Ginger Chicken which didn't have any ginger in it and tasted quite bland.  I tried asking for chilli sauce to help spice up the dish and they seemed offended.  I would recommend finding a better Thai restaurant elsewhere in Berlin.
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,4/18/17,Appetizers was rock hard. Beer was warm. Had the beef fried rice as an Entree. Fried rice wasn't not too bad. Had a good amount of flavor.
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,12/30/15,"Awful experience, feeling very unwelcomed.And the waitress let the couple coming after my friends and me sit first. Feeling being discriminated. It's wired that they don't have Thai tea and mango sticky rice which are both very Thai food. And they don't give me cutlery even after I asked.I sit near the bar counter. There was a candle holder above me. Everything was fine until the candle wax started dropping. The wax was all on my coat. I told one of the waitress, she said she was sorry in a way that I felt insulted. And without giving me a viable solution she left us there. I said I won't pay the bill until they solve this problem. It wasn't the coat it was their attitude. I didn't feel like I am a customer. And she was so angry and started yelling in Thai in a very rude way. I think she was saying some very bad words. Every one in the restaurant was staring at us. Then she took the food and the bill away before we finished.Very bad experience. Food is okay but unless you want to pay a lot for a bad service."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,2,2/19/17,This is a 2 only because the food was actually good. Service is truly terrible. I witnessed another customer get yelled out by a waiter because the waiter bought out the wrong dish. I heard the customer order the dish. Only after I stepped in did the man stop yelling and pointing his finger at the customer to go get the right dish. The staff placed rice and plates on our table. Well the table next to us got their food first. The staff took the plates and rice and gave it to them. I had no problem with that except that we opened rice already and were talking and leaning over the plates. Prices are decent. Preceded at your own risk.
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,4/19/16,"Grat green papaya sald, great lunch menue, a verny nice thai place with good food, ibliked it , its not to pricy.. very friendly staff"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,3/8/17,"I showed up 5 minutes before closing and they would not serve me.  If you do not want to serve when you have stated hours, then change your hours to when you want customers.  All of this was amplified due to it being a downpour."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,1,12/30/15,"Service was horrible!!! horrible!!!They use Thai language to insult people! The candle leaked to my friend's coat and they did not even feel sorry that the incident! They did not responsible for what they did!Do not serve mango sticky rice or Thai tea!!Can't understand English!!"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,5,8/4/15,"Excellent Thai food with cool presentation. The atmosphere is chill and service is laid back (little slow) but it's worth it. Appetizer, entree and a drink can easily be done under ?20!"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,4/10/16,"Very good food and bar. Service was just a bit slow,but very friendly....else I would have rated higher."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,2/24/12,"Great Thai food and great atmosphere. Prices are descent, but the service was a bit slow (at least for American standards). Great variety of food! The presentation was very nice as well.I went here with three other people and everyone really liked the food. Great Thai place if you are in the area."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,5,8/23/15,"Spectacular!After a Thai massage, the masseuse gave me this restaurant as a recommendation. I really don't think I've had better Thai food  anywhere! The red curry's are amazing. The pad Thai spectacular. The Tom Ka Khai  soup was delicious.  The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place for a casual yet wonderful dining experience.Came back a second time as it was so good!!"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,8/25/15,I thought the food here was all right and that it could be better if cooked more but the service was excellent. The Thai ladies running the restaurant were funny and cool and the prices were very reasonable. The one thing that annoyed me is that the coke came in very very small glasses costing EUR 1.9 for each serving and my food was spicy so I had three servings of coke but this is not something that would prevent me from coming here again on my future visits to Berlin.
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,5,12/7/13,A small and nice eatery. Have visited it twice. The food is fresh and well cooked. Polite and friendly service. Price level is reasonable!
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,3/18/13,"Now, almost a year later I can confirm Sheena's comments. Still good selection of good meals, decent prices and a pleasant atmosphere. Give it a try"
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,6/29/14,"Friendly helpful staff, good food - fresh and tasty, reasonable price. I had the yellow curry which as good, not quite as good as the yellow curry as the Lemon Grass at home in Moline, Il! But good. Dolores had the crispy fish and it was also prepared well."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,8/8/15,"The food is great, but service could be improved. The server appeared to have little attitude when we tried to order. Overall would recommend this place due to the good food."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,4,12/16/10,"Kann meine Vorg?nger best?tigen. Essen sehr gut. Einrichtung sehr Bambuslastig, die Suppen sehr gut, aber kleine Portionen. Netter Service. Ruhige Location in der N?he des KDW. Gut zum Entspannen."
Suksan,Thai,3.5,?11-20,5,11/4/11,"I ordered the duck with mango, pineapple etc. it was delicious. the accompanying Jasmine tea was a regular tea bag version so I'd advice not to order the tea. still, I was there for the food and that was great!"
Cao Cao,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,11/11/17,"Their pho was actually quite good!! Beef pho all-day :) Pho ha noi is different from southern style so it was quite a nice surprise.Great service !"
Cao Cao,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,10/20/17,I love the coconut orange sauce?And the sweet potato chips and the beef?The service is great too. Strongly recommended.
Cao Cao,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,6/30/17,Excellent food served quickly at a reasonable price. Service was very good and internal decor of restaurant was very nice. Overall the best meal for the money we had in Berlin. If you like Vietnamese food you will be happy with this restaurant.
Arirang Bulgogi,Korean,3.5,,5,6/9/17,Even better than the one in Zoologischer Garten. Everything is perfect here! Big portion and good price! One of my favourite restaurant in Berlin!
Arirang Bulgogi,Korean,3.5,,2,8/18/17,"I cannot say I was impressed here. I was here the other night with a friend, and we were looking for dinner. We ordered two dolsot bibimbaps, as well as a plate of steamed dumplings to share. It was great that they had these little plates of appetizers, which is typical of Korean food. The bibimbap had somehow more rice than vegetables and meat. I definitely had better bibimbap in other places.But the most shocking thing of all was the dumplings. When we took a bite, it was still frozen inside. We sent it back. It came back after a few minutes, slightly better, but of course, first impressions count.There aren't a lot of choices in this neighborhood, but after my first experience, I definitely would want to search somewhere else before even thinking of going back here."
Arirang Bulgogi,Korean,3.5,,1,9/6/17,It's a bad place! I live in the neighborhood so went there hoping for real korean food. Food is not fresh at all. Frozen or made couple of days ago. On the top the waitress doesn't care about your questions and simply act unprofessional. She tool away the sauces from our tables before we got to use it. I am not picky with food but these restaurants should be closed down by the hygiene services!
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/26/14,"Exquisitely delicious Vietnamese food in the hinterlands of Asi-k?lln at unbelievably good prices. There can only be one!Cash-only. Bigger variety of dishes than its competitors at similar prices, and Pho Phan sticks to what it knows best- traditional Vietnamese cuisine. Surprisingly fabulous soups, standards control factors of Summer Rolls & Tom Kha Gai pass tests with flying flavour!Twice-baked chicken curry is very good, and I ordered the crispy duck a l'orange right off the daily specials. The food tasted fresh, well prepared, and authentic. Nice also to have three lassis to choose from, plus very good tea sorts. The only negative finding was they're understaffed, meaning my food my food-runner couldn't understand German & ran our food right back to the kitchen by accident. The hostess-owner gets accordingly a bit overwhelmed...a good reason to support this business!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,1,9/15/17,Probably one of the worst Pho I ever had. I saw the reviews and it looked good-brought two friends and we all left dissatisfied. Won't be back again & I truly don't understand how this place has 4 stars with the horrible customer service and bad food.
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/17/16,"Very affordable Vietnamese place in Neuk?lln! I got beef pho. It wasn't the best pho I've had but it was only 5,50 and the broth was good. It was quite simple -- just some pieces of thin beef. My friend ordered the red curry with duck. It was only 6,00 and a good size. They gave a significant amount of crispy yummy duck!! Another friend enjoyed his fried noodles, which was huge (7,50). The service was alright and the restaurant itself is spacious and clean. I'll definitely go back when I'm craving Vietnamese food because the place is right in my neighborhood. However, I'll keep searching for the better Vietnamese places!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/4/17,"Absolutely amazing quality food for unbelievably low price. Our mains were ?6 each. I have never eaten so well for so cheap in either London or New York. Portion sizes are huge (see my photos). For mains we ordered mango salad with beef and peanut red curry with beef. I haven't had vietnamese food so good anywhere else. For appetiser we ordered chicken say. Two sticks. Really good. I cannot imagine how lucky we are to find it.They have English menus as well as German (obviously). Servers were really responsive and very kind.It's too bad we don't live in this area otherwise I would come here all the time!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/21/16,"This Little, somewhat hard to find Restaurant serves good food. Pretty good to be honest, I had a soup + main dish and didn't even have to pay 10? for them. Between ordering and arrival of the food, a good 15 min passed.The staff was friendly and fast. Overall a good Vietnamese Restaurant."
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/30/16,One of the best Vietnamese places in Berlin. Me and my wife just love it. We are often here on weekends. You can also order for take a way. The food quality is very high and prices are cheap. Service is good and fast. If you want to feel yourself in Vietnam just visit Pho Phan.
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/23/17,Amazing price value ratio. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. Delicious food. Recommendation!
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/22/16,"came here for dinner last night. Though it seemed understaffed, the staff were helpful and friendly. Ordered fried rice with crispy duck and it was tasty! Will definitely come back here again!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/20/16,Amazing food! Very big portions for a low price. Service is okay could be a bit more friendly. Overall very satisfied!
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/4/17,This place beats top London restaurants for third of the price. Absolutely amazing food !
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/17/16,"This the best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to, the atmosphere could be cozier but with this kind of tasty and fresh food I don't really mind at all. Highly recommended!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/16/14,"Great food and great prices!  The best Vietnamese I've had in Berlin so far.  The restaurant is small but comfortable and was perfect for a dinner with friends.  Service was quick & friendly. My group had a variety of dishes (pho, vermicelli, curry) and all were delicious.  The portions are larger than most in Berlin, which makes them an even better value!  We also had spring and summer rolls and Vietnamese espresso - everything was great!I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Neuk?lln!"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/3/14,"So... We arrived here in the afternoon, visually it's better than most of the Asian restaurants I've seen... Once you get you get struck by the smell of food (good food) and there always sitting aroundThe prices are very economic and the portions are significantly BIGIf you're hungry and you're around you better get inIt took them a while to take the order but the food arrived rather quick (less than 15 minutes)"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/9/14,"After a nice workout I went into this inconsiderable restaurant. Inside it looks not well build for having a awesome food experience. First of all the soup was nothing special. You can taste, that the chicken was kind of swimming inside there more than one hour. But was still fine. After this it happens: The main dish was a mind blowing one. Will come here again. And right now when I'm writing this I'm getting hungry. Please send me some rice noodles with beef. Plssssss"
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/28/14,I just love this place. It is really one of the feq places in Berlin that doesnt only serve food to a low price but also of best quality. Everything I have tried has always bern super fresh and  tasty - which is not always the case for cheaper restaurants in Berlin. A lunch for two (incl. Drinks) for 15? for for this tasty lunch was well worth the travel from Sch?neberg
Pho Phan,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/16/12,"I like this place. Only have gotten a few things, always to go. Really nice service always quick!"
Xiang Shan,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,10/20/17,Great Chinese place next to our hotel. Service is good and reasonable prices. The chef's special chicken was excellent.
Xiang Shan,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,5/4/15,"Very nice place with pleasant decor. The woman who seated and waited on us was very nice and spoke English. The menus were bilingual and had the usual selection that we find in most Chinese restaurants. The food was good and the prices were very reasonable. We had Chicken Fried Rice, something like Kung Pao Chicken and Pork with Asparagus and Mushrooms. All were good but the chicken was not as spicy as we like. I had a spicy curry wurst earlier in the day and found it very mild. We haven't had anything that comes close to spicy in our travels in Europe. The food was good here and we would come back."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/21/17,"Really nice! Very casual setting, we had the pho and sashimi and both were great and served quickly.Super close to Stadtmitte so if you are close to Friedrichstrasse it's a good option."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,12/30/17,Overall I think the food is reasonable compare to the Asian food I had during the trip.  However I was very displeased at them charging me 4.4 euro for hot water.  They claimed that the water were from a bottle not tap water.  I really doubt that.
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,2/4/17,"I have a Asian stomach. I crave for my clear pho broth or some sort of broth when I haven't had any Asian food for awhile. This hits the spot pho-fillingly and especially on a cold night!They serve up sushi rolls too so it's Asian fusion here. Win for the pho broth well made here."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,1/2/18,"Ordered a beef pho last night, it is the worst pho I have ever seen, basically they don't know how to make the pho."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,11/5/17,"Very good sushi, service, and atmosphere.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  Comfortable seating and minimal street noise inside the restaurant."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,8/19/17,Awesome place. Great food & service. Loved the tea as well. I will certainly come back again.
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,9/11/17,"This unassuming place is rather special because of the huge jars of fermenting fruits, etc. along the counter, e.g. garlic Schnapps, sugared limes, etc. We didn't try any of this, but the dishes we had were delicious. Unfortunately rather loud on the Leipzigerstr. but that's going to be true of any place there. Reasonable prices."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,12/29/16,We went with some friends and tried the sushi and a chicken pho. The sushi is not really authentic - it is probably more suited to the German taste profile. We were disappointed with the pho which was a little bland. It was quite busy so our food took a long time to come out. The food and drinks were very good value - the bill for 4 or us with drinks came to around ?85!
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/8/17,"Ordered the fry beef over rice noodle.   It's beyond my expectation, excellent sauce, done just right.   Best Vietnamese rice noodle I've ever had!    Pleasantly surprised with all Asian restaurants in Berlin so far!"
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/18/16,"Try their grilled chicken with Mango Curry from the handwritten menu supplement- it's amazing. We came here our first night in Berlin and I'm sure we will keep coming back. They have everything - won tons, sushi, pho, vegetarian options and lots of curry entrees and delicious pots of tea.  Be warned this is one of the many German buissnesses that does not accept credit cards so bring cash."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,3/25/17,Are you kidding me??? 3 euros for still water and told me cash only???? Who carries around 60 euros in cash all the time in this day and age. Yelp says this place takes credit. I don't like restaurants that lie to customers.
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,7/30/16,GO here if you're stuck in the tourist area and want to have a lot of rice with some sauce and some meat. Don't go here is you want authentic vietnamese food. DEFINITELY don't go here if you want sushi.  That's a bad idea.
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,12/31/16,"Mediocre food, service and atmosphere. Food took forever to come to my table even though the place was empty. No cards accepted. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,12/1/16,Great food and inexpensive. The miso soup was very flavorful and larger than other places I have been to in Europe. The Hanoi rolls and vegetarian rolls tasted great and their potions were more than we expected. I had their sushi 7 special and an unagi roll while my wife had the vegetarian rice noodles with tofu. The noodles were cooked just right and the tofu was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Two reasons keeping me from giving it 5 stars. 1-they don't take credit card so make sure you have enough cash. 2-they didn't have tamago on the sushi menu. I was looking forward to trying it in Berlin to compare to Tokyo. I highly recommend the place and will go back next time I am in Berlin.
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,9/28/15,"We stayed close by to otito when we were in Berlin for a week, and although we didn't dine in there we grabbed some takeaway on a couple of nights when we couldn't be bothered going out. Takeaway from here wasn't a compromise on quality though- every dish I had from here was fresh, and the portions were huge (particularly given that everything we had was under 10 euro!). The staff didn't speak great English, but enough to get by and by the end I they even recognised us and just passed us the takeaway menu. Would definitely recommend."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,10/10/14,"I met up some friends who came over for a visit from home, and called in advance to book a table-they were very nice over the phone and when we got there, are table was resreved indeed,We were nine people in total, started with some fresh summer rolls - one with tofu and the rest had some chicken in them, they were really greatOn to the main courses - I had Yellow curry with chicken and sweet potatoes - can't say I liked to chicken too much, but I have enjoyed my dinner overallAlso got to taste out of my friend's crispy duck which was absolutely greatThere were some other dishes on the table and everyone [except one person, who just doesn't like vietnamease food] were really satisfiedWhen we were done we took some dessertes too and shared deep fried apples and bananas that were yummy! In the drinks section my choice of Pineapple, Mango Mint fruit shake was starring, and my friend who ordered ""Otito Smile"" cocktail seemed pleased as wellOverall, Service was really nice and good value for money [I was expecting it would be a bit more pricy as it is located in Mitte, close to Stadtmitte station]."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,8/27/15,"We ate here 5 times during our 6 day stay in Berlin! We stayed at an air bnb above this place so it was super convenient and they stay open late! They didn't speak any English but that posed no problem, we just pointed at what we wanted and the food spoke for itself! So so good! I had several different kinds of sushi and my boyfriend had  several kinds of curry chicken and other specialty plates! Everything we ate was amazing! I miss it oh so much! If I ever find myself in Berlin I will be back! Also their tea is incredible!!!!"
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,9/9/12,"I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday, after walking all morning. Somehow, the idea of a warm pho enticed me to enter this place. There are two parts to the menu on offer. They have a Vietnamese menu, and they have a Japanese menu. The owner and staff are Vietnamese. So I decided to ignore the Japanese menu and order myself a hot bowl of pho with chicken. I also ordered a beer.They both came rather quick. After all, there weren't a lot of customers, just me, a couple sitting outside, and another single customer sitting inside.I liked the fact that they offer fish sauce as a condiment. I don't see that often, at least when I was living in Buffalo. I don't like the fact that they don't offer fresh Asian mint. They also have a discrepancy with respect to their prices. The menu they give you said that pho is 6,50 EUR, but they charged me something higher. They charged me 7,50 EUR, which matched the menu posted at the door. It would have been great if they synchronize every menu they have so people won't get confused. Anyway, for pho, I think this was more on the expensive side, given that the pho they served me was just okay. Nothing spectacular. I'll try to find other pho establishments and see if I can find something better than this."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,8/19/14,"This restaurant saved our lives on a Sunday night, when everything else around was closed - so make a note, lost tourists who thought Berlin was way busier than that: Otito's kitchen closes at 11pm! Yay!Food is quite good, even if we found the Ph? (?6.50) a bit tasteless (no spices, no sauce - the soup basically tasted of freshly chopped chive). The Bun Bo (?7.50) was way better, we highly recommend it - and do not hesitate to splurge on nems as starters (?3.50), they are really worth it.Service is OK, quite rushy, even though I do understand that the fact that we showed up so late probably didn't help. They don't serve tap water and make you pay ?2.50 for 0.2L of mineral water, which is not due to us though, and definitely contributed to make their note a 3 and not a 4."
Otito,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,9/8/15,"Really solid food, surprisingly fresh and tasty. What else can one ask for for this price range? The place doesn't look fancy but the service was friendly and accommodating. Apart from the slightly tasteless chicken (which is often slightly dubious (=cheap and overcooked) in Asian restaurants in Germany but also the cheapest ""meat"" on their menus) everything was really fresh and tasty.  No complaints. Mixed crowd. Lots of tourists seem to wander into the restaurant, probably due to its location close to check point Charly & Co.Definitely recommendable!"
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,5,2/14/17,"Really cool restaurant, with tasty food. The tapas concept, allows you to taste a lot of different food, which is nice, but make sure you order enough. The waiter suggested we ordered two dishes each, and a bowl of rice, but she was also quite small compared to us, so we had to get three each, to be satisfied. However, she was both friendly and fast, so that we wouldn't sit starving. The atmosphere in the restaurant was easy-going, and the decor was hip, you would be seated at long wood tables next to some other guests, which made it feel authentic and casual. It was fairly cheap, and definetly a place I would comeBack to, if I was to stay longer time in Berlin. The location is also good, in the middle of Friederichshains cool area, with lots of restaurants and bars."
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,2,9/2/17,"Service: 1/5 Food: 4/5The food was pretty good, and the atmosphere fit, but the service was truly nonexistent. We sat ourselves after waiting for 10 minutes, then waited another twenty minutes before my friend stood up and stopped an employee walking by so that we could order. Then we waited for our food for about an hour. at this point we'd invested too much time to just walk out. We'd finished our drinks but of course never got the chance to ask for another. Finally our food came, and it was the wrong order! What we ate was very good, but it definitely wasn't what we ordered.  Finally we waited another twenty minutes before we just stood up and asked a different waiter for our bill. ?38 total, for what I'm not sure since i don't know which meal we were charged for. Overall took about 2 and a half hours. Obviously will not be returning. Maybe it was just an off night? It was a friday, and the restaurant was probably 90% full so? maybe that's why. But food wasn't good enough to convince me to try again."
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,2,9/2/17,"Went and the service was largely unfriendly and never came to see us- we waited 40 minutes before someone came to see us about our order, and our food took another hour, and we didn't see them again until I stood up and got someone for the check. Food tasted great, there's a good variety, but we got the wrong dish (but at least it was good anyway, and the same price as what we payed for). The cocktails were way too strong, almost pure alchohol."
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,4,6/4/17,"A huge selection of dishes. The duck was a bit too crispy for my taste, but I enjoyed the rest of the food. Try out any coconut curry dish and the fried dumplings!"
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,5,12/15/16,"Best food in Friedrichshain. Fresh and flavoursome, friendly service, nice environment. A little pricey but highly recommended."
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,3,8/10/17,"I was back today and sadly the food wasn't quite as good. one of the sauces tasted like its gone bad and the waiter said ""its a different recipe"", but gave us no refund or anything else to try instead. Not used to such lack of customer service. Especially cause this place is not cheap for Berlin standards. Sad."
Hangmee,Laotian,4,?11-20,5,3/2/17,"Very nice staff, delicious food and drinks! Many vegetarian options. I liked the atmosphere and interior, with attention to the detail. I am very happy and will come back."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/3/15,"In a word - best dim sum I have ever had in my life, even better than in China!Longer version (for the brave) - hands down, best dim sum I've had so far.We've arrived here for dinner before it got really crowded, so if you plan on coming here after 20:00- reserve a table, the place is pretty small.Once we've opened the menu we were thinking ""ok, so what do we not order?!""As my friend is vegetarian, we had about 9 options to choose from if you exclude the ones with chicken/pork/seafood.Which is quite a lot! So we've settled on four, all vegetarian.The one who took our order asked if we're vegan or vegetarian, we said no but didn't really understood why - until he put complimentary prawn crackers on the table, super nice and highly considerate! For a starter we had a soup that was kind of tasteless until we added some soy into it, but as the dim sum arrived we forget about it.9 - kakao traum, absolute best! If we weren't full after all the food we'd totally order one more round of those, perfect flavor, perfect serving.The others we've taken were also really good, but this was really something else.From our point of view this is a place you can't really go wrong.There's no good and bad, just tasty and tastier!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,3,3/2/16,"Hmmm apart from the very cute utensils and the super cute dessert baozi (one with chocolate in panda shape and one with strawberry jam in piggy shape) the other dimsums are average at best.Ha gaw and dumpling are most likely frozen ones from the supermarket with super thick wrappings. The filling is tasty but the wrap just kills the merit of the filling. XLB is very disappointing :("
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/25/17,"My first experience with Dim Sum. I can't vouch for authenticity, but it was definitely delicious.Go early or reserve ahead. Space is limited"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,2,5/2/16,"Worst dim sum ever.. Yes.. I got suckered in as I saw the miss piggy dessert pictures on other reviews. The miss piggy dessert was nothing but bread with artificial strawberry jam in it. The rest of the dim sum was subpar compared to any other authentic Chinese venue. I ordered the typical dishes shi jin bao, cha shao bao, dumplings with vegetables, glass noodles, and carrots, and xiao long bao. It just didn't taste fresh at all. Our server was nice and attentive. She gets 2 star for that. End of story. I don't know how this place has so many stars."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/10/16,"Tried it out if curiosity. I got a salad (cucumber) and  dumplings. I loved both. They have so many kinds of dumplings. I tried a couple and have fallen in love with this place. Situated in a charming street , I think the only restaurant I'm this side of the Street, this place has a lot to offer. Definitely worth checking out."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/26/16,"I wanted to try this place for some tjme and finally made it! Wonderful place for dumplings! Cheap, tasty, fast and a great service! It's a small cute shop in a nice area, the tea is super special. The menu is small but I find it a good thing. Their specialty is the dim sum. They have also quite a few options for vegetarians and vegans. Absolutely love it."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,1,7/30/16,"The 3 color(dish no. F4 Sanse) is the one I like the most! Good service, nice stuff but the food taste not surprising, not really recommend... I feel sorry"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/15/15,"Oh my goodness - AMAZING DUMPLING AND GREAT SERVICE!Came her around 5 a couple days ago expecting to wait for a table (based on the other yelp reviews) but we were quickly seated and given cushions and a nice table spread to make sitting outside more comfortable. The waiter and waitress were very sweet and attentive and our food came out in a timely manner! The prawn crackers they serve before your meal are delightful. The dumplings were delicious and ask for the sweet chili sauce! It's really nice with the shrimp dumplings. The green tea is served in a nice porcelain detailed painted tea pot with adorable little cups. And every dumpling plate is ?4.90... What could be better!Wasn't a huge fan of the dessert chocolate bear dumplings but it was good to try. Can't wait to go back!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/15/16,"so, SO good. amazing prices (we drank and ate until we were stuffed, for under 25 euros). small restaurant and cash only as far as i can tell, but i would come here every day if i could. most importantly, EXCEPTIONAL service (which is a rare find)."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/22/16,Very nice place to eat for cheap! Service was mediocre.
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/3/14,"I've always been a fan of dim sum. It's like heaven in your mouth. So when an opportunity presented itself to go to this place, I immediately took it. A companion was visiting town, so when we needed to have dinner, I suggested this place and made a reservation.They don't have an extensive menu. They have two soup types, a handful of cold salads and other appetizers, about 5 vegetarian dim sum, and about 8 meat-filled dim sum. But that was enough to bring heaven to the inside of my mouth. My companion and I each ordered a soup, and I tried the wantan soup, which was delicate in its flavor and presentation. The wantans were floating in warm soupy bliss. It had just the right taste, and was meant more to enjoy and savor, than to simply slurp.Then my companion and I ordered three different dim sum to share. With perhaps the most expensive order still being under 5 EUR, this wasn't an expensive meal. Each order have 5 pieces of dim sum, presented inside a steamer, and yes, they provide wooden non-disposable chopsticks. They also ask you what kind of sauce you want, as they have several choices at your disposal. Oh, the shao mai, and the shrimp-filled steamed mini buns, they were all heaven in my mouth. Next time, I'd go down the menu and try the other items.I'll definitely be back. This is a great find, and is something that will be on the top of my list for a while. Reservations are recommended, as they are a very small place, with only a few tables inside."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/20/15,"I love dim sum- it's my absolute favorite. This place was absolutely delicious, and they have some very unusual kinds. They have an entire selection of vegan/vegetarian dumplings, really adorable dessert buns, and unusual and flavorful sides.The place is pretty small, but it has a nice homey atmosphere.  I'd recommend arriving before the peak dinner hours, or making a reservation. However, if they don't have any open tables, they also take your number and give you a call when one opens up, so you can explore the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in the meantime."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,1,11/10/15,"Edit May 2017: 2 years ago I visited the place and rated it with 5 stars.Today I'm giving it just one star because the dumplings taste like supermarket frozen ones.I expected fresh dumplings that are not teaming with preservatifs but there you go. Not gonna find that here."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/8/16,"Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it was still really good. The price was fair and the waitress was really sweet and on the ball. The other woman working there was also really nice as well. Definitely coming back."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/11/16,"So so so good. Loved the wonton soup and the rice wrapper pork dumplings! The perfect place for a quiet, low-key, delicious meal."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,1/23/15,"We already ate at Lecker Song a lot of times since this little restaurant with just a few tables opened . It's always very good, always very fresh. Everything is homemade, original and tasty.You're always warmly welcome, both the owner and the staff are very friendly.A good place, to recommend."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,3,7/2/16,"This is a cozy cute place. Offers mostly a small portion with about 4 tiny one bite size (no bigger than McNugget size) dumplings costs 4.5-5 Euro average/per plate. I would not consider this to be exactly cheap. If you are hungry and sharing, you would probably want to order about 3-4 plates each person. I do not have a size of cow stomach and I am a tiny woman. Do the math. Should not be listed as ?. More like ??? for what it is."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/7/15,Amazing dumplings and friendly service. This is the best dim sum I've had in Berlin. Their tea selection is also amazing.
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/30/16,Amazing place to experience authentic chinese dumplings while also being able to eat fully vegan if you want to! Everything vegan on the menu is deliciou and the staff is really nice!
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/24/14,This little and tiny restaurant is hidden just behind Helmholtzplatz. The first time I tried to find it I almost passed it. Once you enter you are being welcomed by the friendly owner who offers you one of the very few buy cozy tables. They have various dumplings with many different fillings and tastes. I always just order a few and then more along the way. In that way you can spend a good and relaxed time with friends here. Food tastes solid but there is still a bit  room for improvement. It's pretty pricey as well but overall better than all the places along Kantstrasse. Certainly worth a try. But rather don't come in large groups.
China Imbiss,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/31/10,"Excelent food, very delicious and good prices. I had duck, which was almost fat free. Very good prices 3 - 6,50EUR. I waited only few minutes for food even I had actually duck. But they've got no daily menu in English and they don't speak English."
China Imbiss,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/26/11,Nothing fancy there but some really decent food for such a cheap price.
China Imbiss,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/2/11,"Really really deliscious! Fast as well, and very friendly! Check it out!"

myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/1/15,"Prices are fair and affordable.Staff is friendly, welcoming and cares.Food is great and is prepared with love and passion.The restaurant itself is clean, simple and easy-going. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.The lady at the counter was singing to herself while she was preparing the meals. It made the ambiance even more comfortable. This is my new neighborhood Thai restaurant because there are still many other things on the menu I want to try there.Also, a big plus: They have a note on the wall stating that they are not using MSG a.k.a Glutamate. Yay!"
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/13/16,"Delicious food. We had pad Thai, a mouthwatering papaya salad and a refreshing and not overly sweet Thai ice tea, it was exceptional. The prices are good and the food is awesome and the service is also friendly. We highly recommend this place if you appreciate incredible food at reasonable prices."
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,3/1/16,Solid as usual. I got sukiyaki (thai style suki) today and it was great! I was full after a ?6.5 bowl of good broth. My friend got satay and paneang curry and was happy about it. We came towards the end so the ladies were less cheerful than last time we came but the service was great though not as welcoming and as friendly as last time :(
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/9/16,"Delicious thai food in the heart of Berlin. Better yet, they had THAI ICED TEA! My first thai restaurant that I've come across who serves thai ice tea. The pad thai was good, but the green curry was the best --delicious."
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/14/16,Excellent food! Ambience ok for a quick bite. Wanted to order a second dish right away!!
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/30/16,"If you like Thai food and are in Berlin this is the place to go.I have travelled extensively in Thailand in non-touristy places. When travelling in other countries I always try to find good Thai restaurants. Outside Thailand ""My Thai"" without a doubt serves the best Thai food I have ever had. I doubt whether you can get the food any more authentic outside Thailand. My son and I shared a Laab, a dry red curry and a red curry with coconut milk. All three were delicious and we were asked if we wanted the chili heat to be western or authentic. Great for those of us who like chili :-)The staff were really friendly and helpful and the food was served very quickly.All together a superb experience. Unfortunately it was our last evening in town, so only managed one visit that time around. Not the last though - that's for sure."
myThais,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/31/11,"One of my favorite restaurant for lunch after class, the restaurant is small, cozy, close to Goethe Strasse in Charlottenburg area. The cooks are Thai and very friendly ladies.. I always find it a pleasure to sit there, have a long lunch with some friends and enjoy the food that fits to my taste bud. One more thing, it's very affordable, especially for its lunch menu!"
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/1/14,"I would make it short, and just sum it up by amazing!Really good restaurant, very friendly and caring staff, good and tasty food, very calm and laid back and prices are really good too for the quality of the placeHad a really good time and I will come and again for sureSorry there are no pics but it was too good I forgot"
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,1,7/10/17,"This place was a total disgrace to Thai food. It's more like glorified Chinese food. Think Panda Express scoop sloppy junk food into your bowl and call it a day. The Tom Kha soup was acceptable, I'll give them that, but that's where it all ends, instantly. We ordered a duck dish and an octopus dish, both of the dishes we received were completely different ones than what we ordered. I'm guessing that the huge complex menu they have is more of a show off than reality, and they're really only serving a few dishes from each respected meat/seafood choice. I ordered the duck that was supposed to come with a pineapple, mango, and apple curry, and what I got was junky duck soaked in a .05 cent sesame sauce. My girlfriend ordered the fried octopus in red curry, and what she got wasn't even octopus, it was squid, and it was also soaked in the same terrible sesame sauce as my duck. I know they got our orders correct because we ordered them in Thai and gave the number, but I'm willing to bet that they just expect people to be clueless on what they're really ordering and instead of making all of these complex dishes they have on their menu, they just pawn you off with a basic simple dish that 99% of people are just going to accept as what they ordered. Simply put, the food was disgusting. We eat Thai food multiple times a week in our home city, and this isn't even Thai food. I won't even get into the lack of spiciness, that's Berlin as a whole, so I won't rant on that. Do yourself a favor and stick to the well known Vietnamese places around Berlin, they're actually good.Looking at the response from, what I'm guessing is the owner or manager, it just goes to show I must have hit a nerve. What an immature and unprofessional response to valid claims, that you just proved to be true by your little temper tantrum. The only ""Trump"" here is you, with your little temper tantrum and avoiding the truth. Maybe you should go sit in the corner now and read a cook book before continue this pathway of embarrassment. Then while your at it, post some more fake Yelp reviews to boost your terrible restaurant."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,6/17/17,"Nice Thai place with an extensive menu but somewhat lackluster dishes. Their som tam thai (traditional papaya salad) and tom yum gai are not spicy at all and are a bit lacking in flavor. Those dishes, in Thai cuisine, are supposed to SPICY, and the ones here were not spicy at all. Kind of disappointing, to be honest. That being said, the portions are generous, their smoothies are yummy, and the servers are nice."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,10/29/16,"This place may have the best bang for your buck. I wound up getting the chicken satays, whole fried fish, and the mango & ice cream and the price was quite reasonable. They give you 5 large pieces of chicken for the appetizer which really nice and the fish itself was huge. I got a whole fish for 12.50 euros which is probably the cheapest I've ever gotten one at a restaurant. I asked for it Thai spicy because I'm a huge fan of spicy food and they did not disappoint :) This is one of the few places in Europe that has actually satisfied me with spiciness. The one complaint that I have is that the mango & ice cream dish at the end of the meal was unripe and it was difficult to cut through the mango. It kind of took away from the rest of the delicious meal, but this place still gets a four stars because the rest of the food was so good! I would highly recommend you check this place out if you have the chance."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,10/25/15,"Yum! My new favorite Thai place in Berlin. Since first eating there a few weeks ago, I have gone back every weekend. I love their curries and love their giant urns of rice they bring to the table. Service is friendly and fast. Make sure to make a reservation, it is cozy!One negative point: the take out is noticeably not as good as the in-house food. The portions also really seemed a lot smaller :)"
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,8/8/15,"Not spicy enough IMO. The Tom yum soup was good though. Nice ambiance, good for spending an evening."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,3/8/14,"Just had dinner here with my brother and a friend from New York. The service was very good and the restaurant was relaxed. Even though it was a bit smaller, it didn't feel overly crowded.I was expecting the soup to be a bit more spicy, but flavour-wise all was very nicely prepared. My brother had a starter which included the home-made plume sauce, which was excellent!I felt I had the least interesting of main courses, although that does not mean it was bad; the others were just a bit more interesting. I had the duck with a sweet sauce and nice veggies.Overall, a good place to get good Thai food for a good price.Kevin"
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,9/29/14,"Really great Thai food at a great price! Friendly staff that provide a nice and cozy atmosphere. We had a great dinner, and can recommend their red curry :). They don't accept international credit cards, only German cards - reason why it's only a 4."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,6/22/14,"Honestly I've never been to thailand but I have eaten in plently of thai restaurants all over the world but this is among the best. great service, cosy interior and quality food. I love this place"

Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,6/25/11,"This is a lovely little place. We went there with a large group of people and although the place is quite small all worked out very well. The food arrived in good time and was very good. The extremely nice waitress didn't even panic when even more people showed up than we had told them when making the reservation. Would go there again."
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,6/25/14,Good food and lovely attentive and friendly staff. Simple as that!
Taleh Thai,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,12/30/12,"We just ate at Taleh Thai for the first time, pleasantly surprised by the cosy space and good service, extremely nice smell coming from the kitchen. We had fried (veg) thai rolls which were fine but nothing exceptional and a very good papaya salad, fresh and generous. As a main course we had tofu pad thai that was good but a bit too sweet and maybe a little bit too oily, but especially I felt it was lacking lime. I took myself a special dish which was steamed seafood in coconut curry sauce, that was very good and tasteful (plenty of thai basil and lemongrass) but I must say that we were a bit shocked to see surimi and some sort of fish balls among the seafood.Another negative point has been the fresh mango served with icecream, which was clearly not a good mango (kinda green and a bit hard).So my conclusion is that the service was great, food was good at this price point (52euros, starter/main course/dessert for two, plus 3 (very good) teas) but a few disappointing details.I think we will give it another chance, picking other dishes"
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,9/24/17,Excellent Thai. Just fantastic. Some of the most tender and flavorful chicken and beef my gf and I have ever tried (and we live in NYC and eat standout Thai regularly). Caipirinhas we're top notch also.
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,7/4/16,"Food was excellent. Well prepared. Bursting with flavors. Good sized portions. Sat outside in back, nice area. Service, though, needs attention. Drink order mixed up, had to request correct drink several times before it was brought. Sharing all food between 4 people, plates should have been brought to each of us, had to request it. So, balance tasty well seasoned and prepared food against spotty service. Would I return?  Yes."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,7/17/16,"If you are hungry and should be as happy to be nearby Alexanderplatz, you have to go and eat here. It's not right at the Alexanderplatz, you have to ride the cable car for two stops. But it's definitely worth the ride. My Airbnb-landlord suggested it to me, because all of their sublettees tell her how well it is and their are dawn right. When I got there, I even saw some Cologne YouTubers sit there and eat. Now about atmosphere and the food: I was there in summer and they have quite a big terrace to sit at. Still, all seats were taken (all the other restaurants nearby were empty). We were five people, so usually it's not easy to be seated if the place is so busy. But... after waiting in the queue for five minutes, we could sit down. These guys are really attentive. At another table, some guys tried to sit down where other people left and thus would safe some waiting time. But the waiters immediately told them to stand up and stand in line like everyone else. I've never seen before that waiters are so attentive. The food was really delicious and served in way you just wanted to eat it right away. There are soups, dishes with rice or noodles as basis and the food as such tasted really genuine. The very special thing: Self-made drinks and smoothies make every dish even a little bit more special."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,4/29/17,"Hands down, this is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. For our appetizer, we ordered veggie spring rolls with this delicious sweet and sour sauce. I also had the fried rice with chicken skewers and it came with a delicious peanut sauce that was life changing! The ambience of the restaurant is modern and relaxing, and the staff was friendly."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,7/1/15,"This place reminds me of P.F. Chang's: big and spacious environment/semi-fancy dimly lit atmosphere, and great food -- although not authentic asian food if that's what you're looking for. More asian fusion that slightly leans more on the Thai food emphasis. After all, I did have the Gai Sam Rod from the Chicken section of the menu (crispy chicken with pineapple, water chestnuts, snap peas, and peppers in sweet and sour and spicy sauce), but they did have less Americanized options.Their portions are pretty big, and the prices are slightly above average. However, I think they make up for it in the food presentation (beautiful!) and the nice ambiance.I didn't think service was slow, but we did go past the lunch rush around 1:30 PM. They also don't mind serving tap water if you ask. If you're looking for a place with tasty asian fusion food in a nice atmosphere, I would definitely come here! It's a good time. (Ha.)"
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,12/22/16,"Located in the heart of Mitte,this Thai joint delivers qualitythai quick fast and in a hurry.i had the Nasi Goreng andmy partner had the CrispyFried Chicken with red curry.Both Dishes complimented by Fresh Mojitos. The Mintand Lime in the CocktailsCombined to create a Thaitaste that lingered on the Tongue whilst cleaning the Pallet. A Sensory ExperienceSecond to None.Good Time=Good Food.p.s. the 'Open Kitchen' is a ThaiTrademark and should becomestandard."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,1/26/16,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in; greeted with very friendly staff. They spoke German and English and although we had no reservation, they arranged a table for 7 in no time.The place is often crowded. It has very nice tropical-inspired decor; which is complemented with the also tropical-inspired staff uniforms and dishes.The service is quick and the staff is well informed about what comes in the dishes they are offering.I would definitely recommend this place. My favorites were the following dishes:- Lumpia Sayur (spring rolls)- Udang Bawang (grilled prawns with garlic chili sauce)- Sambal Udang (stir fried prawns with Sambal sauce)- egg fried rice- fried noodles- there is a side entrance that could be used for wheelchair users"
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,1/9/16,"Food: The food was delicious but not spectacular. The portions were rather small, so if you are hungry I recommend to order at least 3 dishes for two people. We've ordered the papaya salad, pad thai with shrimps, a curry dish and the ribs. The curry dish and papaya salad needed more flavour (e.g. herbs). Pad thai was good - not too oily nor to dry. The ribs were a bit disappointing- too dry and carelessly served. Furthermore, they have self-made lemonade/drinks with fresh herbs and fruits in the summer that were refreshing and tasty - a must try.Service: Young team of servers that are friendly and easygoing.Interior: Chic and stylish decorated interior. The whole restaurant is equipped with dark furnishings and curtains that create a quiet and private atmosphere for each table.Price: Pricy compared to the quality and portions of the dishes."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,7/8/17,"Had the spicy minced beef stir fry with rice.    Very spicy but I can handle it well.   Hot and tasty, although a bit oily.    Havn't tried other things on the menu yet, but will do next time."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,2,8/30/16,"German PF Chang's but more expensive, slow, and bland. If you're in Mitte, it's okay in a pinch but really best avoided. Take the train for ten minutes and eat somewhere better. Thai food in the US is much better."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,2/18/15,"Excellent food! There was a group of 6 of us and all our dishes, from Duck, Curry, Beef were super tasty.  Even though it was a Wednesday night, the place was a full house. Thankfully we made reservations. The reason why I did not score higher is because of the service. They were very eager to make money but with 6 people, they only offered 2 bowls of rice. Ofcourse once we asked for it, they gave us another bowl. Perhaps it's better not to waste, which is why they put our less?"
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,3/18/17,"Walked by Good Time and was curious because of the, not a lot of traffic out front and from the front two windows we thought ok, it's a small restaurant and only half of it was full so we decided to try and my friend wasn't to sure. But we walked the place was a buzz and there was another whole back section completely full and we didn't have a reservation, but they found us a table. And I was so so glad we stopped in. By far the best Thai food in Berlin. I will return every time I'm in Berlin."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,5/14/13,"Most Thai restaurants are with the mom-and-pop variety: it isn't swanky, and there are plenty of Thai royalty decor adorning the walls. This one is more Thai-inspired Asian fusion. If you were looking for the authentic Thai-restaurant-where-Thai-people-go experience, then this isn't the place to go. Go to DAO Restaurant near Savignyplatz instead (http://www.yelp.com/biz/dao-restaurant-berlin). That being said, I think one can still enjoy this place given the right mindset. This is one of the more swanky bring-a-date sort of place, though the interior can be a little loud.I ordered a pad kee mao (No. 29), and what came out was something totally different from the pad kee mao I was expecting. I was expecting a noodle dish that is very spicy, complete with Thai herbs and peppers, but what came out was a duck dish with the same spices, but the noodles were relegated down to being a side ingredient, not a main ingredient. And it now comes with rice. So, instead of a pad kee mao, I got a ""pad kee mao"". I originally thought I'd give it 3 stars. But once I fixed my mindset, I upped it to 4. After all, there's nothing bad in going to a Thai-inspired fusion restaurant. Besides, it's not like they're claiming to be authentic. Bottomline, if you want to go to a restaurant where Thai people go, don't go here. But if you want to feel a little swanky while eating Thai-inspired cuisine, then by all means go here."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,7/7/15,"Interesting place. The food is tasty. Would recommend this place without hesitation. Sitting out on the sidewalk is quite pleasant, especially in the late afternoon."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,9/5/15,Average plus. The service is good. Prices a bit expensive. The dishes were interesting
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,11/26/16,The foods are very good but the drinks are little expensive. Nice location but inside is too laud.
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,1/4/16,"Went with two couples on a Sunday evening. The place was well visited but not packed. Despite that the service was inattentive. It took ages for the occasional waiter to show up and our meals arrived separately over a period of 10 minutes. We skipped deserts after it caused the waitress by surprise that after she collected the plates and never showed up again we dared to ask for a desert menu. Clearly there is a problem with the employees' incentives. Nevertheless, the food was actually quite good and so were the cocktails, but with that kind of service this place will not see us again anytime soon."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,6/4/14,"Damn good. Will trek over here for this damn good kickn Pad Thai. Best Pad Thai in Berlin, although I had to take a star off because they downgraded their shrimp from superb quality to just ok. Come to think of it, good service and layout too... in stark contrast to the freaky hostess with terrible service at my former #2 in PBerg.All around, highly recommend. Right off the Bahn."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,7/18/14,"We had a lovely meal sitting outside the restaurant under the umbrellas. We didn't arrive until after 10:30pm but the kitchen was still open. I had the extra spicy beef dish that was identified in menu with many chilli pepper icons. It was spicy as advertised and might be a too hot for European palettes. For my North American palette it was exactly what I was looking for. It was delicious, flavourful and the spice was not over powering. I loved it. Just order a Tiger beer to go with it.  My wife is a vegetarian and she had a great selection to choose from. It was nice that we could find top notch choices for both of us for once. Give it a try. We enjoyed ourselves."
Good Time,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,11/1/15,"Great pad Thai and curry chicken dish. Great value and casual dining considering it is in the touristy area. Spare ribs for starters were a bit sweet for my taste but spring rolls and sauce were excellent. Service was good and friendly. Place was busy for a Sunday night. Would recommend it for anyone wanting something other than German food."
Thai Cuisine,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,11/17/17,"Good, not great food. I think I want to come back for dinner and try their other foods, but lunch prices were reasonable, but even when asking for spicy food, it was very bland."
Thai Cuisine,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,4/30/17,"Good food, great atmosphere. The owner is super nice, and seems to know his Thai pretty well, even though he's German. It's a little overpriced in my opinion, but maybe that's to compensate for their great interior design."
Thai Cuisine,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,1/2/14,"Probably the best Thai in Berlin in terms of flavor and diversity of offerings.  Flavors are close to the real thing, and the kitchen isn't afraid to go full spicy.  Some of the dishes veer uncomfortably close to the generic ""brown sauce"" of Asian cuisine in Germany, and the seafood options are occassionally a little off, but the restauarant's presentation and good service make up for the occasional food stumbles.  The Middle Way does not serve alcohol, but offers by far the best assortment of fruit drinks and non-alcoholic punches I've found in Berlin."
Hikari Sushi,Sushi Bars,5,?11-20,5,5/27/16,"Great Sushi restaurant in Zellendorf. It's clean, service was great. The menu has a diverse choice. Sushi was fresh and very good. I recommend this restaurant."
Hikari Sushi,Sushi Bars,5,?11-20,4,7/29/16,My family and I tried this place yesterday for the first time. The service is great and very friendly. The sushi is fresh and you will get great quality for a fair price. We can really recommend this place if you are looking for a sushi place in souther Berlin.
Hikari Sushi,Sushi Bars,5,?11-20,5,2/6/17,"Nice and clean place for a quick lunch or dinner. Absolutely love the quality of food. Simply tasteful. Pleasant service, fair charges. Delivery works very good as well. Highly recommended."
Hikari Sushi,Sushi Bars,5,?11-20,5,11/29/15,I live upstairs and their are really competing against my kitchen :) food is really really good and people have lovely attitude. people I went hear with are having the same satisfaction. :) great to have your guys in zehlendorf
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/24/14,"Truly authentic, fresh and beautifully tasty Chinese food.The eggplant is really good. Nice authentic Chinese food and great service. Oh, and you can get hot pot too! Just call ahead to book it :)"
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,2/26/17,"I tried a soup and the vegetarian dumplings - nothing to write home about, but the service was ok and nice."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,4/7/16,"Excellent and authentic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin. It's probably my favorite Chinese restaurant outside of China or Los Angeles. It is so good. I recommend the pork soup dumplings, pork belly, beef tripe, and jellyfish and cucumber. It's fun for me to read the menu in Chinese and German when my primary language is English. The wait staff speak it all so be comfortable ordering. I hope this restaurant stays in business forever. Perhaps they can open up a location in West Berlin too."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,11/1/16,"I don't like given Chinese restaurants bad reviews since I'm Chinese myself, but this place does not deserve 4.5 stars.  First of all they serve jasmine rice instead of traditional sticky rice. Also, the dumplings and tofu were the cheaper store bought kind.  I don't expect homemade tofu everywhere, but at least spend the extra 20 cents and buy the silken tofu for your mapo tofu.  I will say the waiter was very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,6/8/16,"The food is nothing special at all. I guess the right word would be ""edible"". So, no reason to go. Also, that waitress sure was awkward and not very good."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,11/4/16,"Our group of four had an excellent meal here last week. Service was fine (by Berlin standards) and, more important, the menu was varied and the food tasted great--the spicy dishes were actually spicy (and not Germanized into blandness). We had the Qualle (quail egg) appetizer, Aubergine appetizer, and the boneless chicken in Szechuan chili oil sauce to start--all very good. For main courses, we had Gongbao chicken, lamb with coriander, and the pork belly (favorite of Chairman Mao, supposedly). All very tasty."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,8/2/16,This restaurant deserves more recognition. Very good food at decent price. Huge menu.
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,4/2/16,"The only reason I've given this restaurant 1 star is because the food is good. I'm not going to go into detail but if there's more than 2 people in the restaurant, don't bother. You could be waiting hours for your food. More attention is given to take-aways than guests VERY patiently waiting hours. And I do mean HOURS! Never again!!!!UPDATE!!Went there again! The restaurant looked pretty quiet so we went in to give it another chance. The food was typically good and there were 'TWO' pleasant waitresses BUT, as we waited and waited for our food, numerous take-out customers came in to collect food and at one point, most of the customers were Deliveroo and Foodora deliverers. Is this the way restaurants are going?We were getting to the point of 'where's our food!!!' when it arrived. The Mayflower should downsize to being a take-away restaurant and save on rental space. It clearly gives take-out customers preference. Seriously. That WAS the last time!"
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,7/20/16,"This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot and sour soup was as sweet as ice cream, stank of vinegar and it was not spicy(hot) at all. The Gongbau chicken was mostly tiny bits of chicken and cabbage swimming in a sickening red-orange gloppy sauce, with perhaps three peanuts. It was not spicy. While Berlin can be a difficult city for Chinese cuisine, there are much, much better options. The owners should be ashamed: this is of such a low standard I can't comprehend how you could knowingly serve this food to customers. While I can see some other Yelpers have liked it, I wonder what their standards might be..."
Mayflower,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/10/15,Most amazing Chinese restaurant with the best Sichuan cuisine I've experienced so far in Berlin!
Furusato,Korean,4,?11-20,5,12/27/17,Authentic Korean food in Berlin. Service was very friendly and prompt. Nice trendy decoration and relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely visit again!
Furusato,Korean,4,?11-20,5,11/23/13,"Korean, a good one, a real one!!!*Food: I had the Su Du Bun(soup with silken tofu and seafood). It's cold outside and I requested it extra hot; A MA zing ! Served with well cooked and rightly portioned rice.As expected in a Korean restaurant, several small plates of vegetables came along. Was super filling and worth the price. Not cheap 13,5 for the soup but for that quality no one should mind.*Staff : the place is owned by Korean ladies; difficult to do more genuine. The ladies are very service oriented which makes the experience even more agreeable *Atmosphere : cosy eve w close friends or date*Location : a couple of blocks from S bahn Savignyplatz, easy to reachIf you are in Berlin and crave for Korean food, that's the place."
Furusato,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/3/15,"Lovely sidewalk table. Seafood Crepe, then bulgogi cooked tableside.  Complimentary hot after dinner drink of ginger, cinamon and honey.  Perfect meal before swing dancing around a few blocks away at Cafe Keefe's."
Furusato,Korean,4,?11-20,3,8/29/15,"Me and my friend occasionally discovered Furusato on our walk in Charlottenburg. We were really pleased by simple and stylish design of the place. Service was also nice. About the food: I am not expert but it didn't seemed really special to me. It felt like small Korean bistro style. Prices are a bit too high for what is offered. However, as a bonus everybody gets small portions of ... I guess 6 different appetizers. That was really nice. The table was looking fool :) Disappointing point: : when we came there was a big and very loud english speaking group dining in the first room (the one which comes to the left when you enter). The woman on the bar (waitress or the owner) directed us explicitly to sit next to the group mentioned. I guess because she wanted to have all the guests in one place. Logically, the whole evening we spent in the shadow of this loud group, listening (we had to, no other chance) to them. I think this kind of big groups should always be in a separate space for the sake of others.So, I suppose it's quite nice and cozy place when there is no big groups."
Furusato,Korean,4,?11-20,5,4/25/11,"We went here for dinner last night and had a really enjoyable experience! We were two veggies and one carnivore and they catered for us all really well and the waitress spoke both good German and English. We had steamed and fried dumplings as well as miso soup to start and we couldn't fault them. I thought the fried dumplings were the best though and the soy based dipping sauce was a cut above normal sauces with a slighty sweet, garlic and sesame flavour to it. For main course, my partner had a vegetarian version of Bibimbap (his favourite) which the waitress offered to show him how to mix up - he declined as he has done it before - but the owner then insisted on ""helping"" him some minutes later as he clearly hadn't done it right. This could have seemed intrusive to some but it really didn't feel it as overall this is a very friendly place where the owners and staff take a great price in the quality of the food as well as the experience of the diners. My vegetables with glass noodles and my friend's duck in sweet sauce were also excellent and we had clean plates all round. Along with the main courses also came a portion of rice and a selection of sides which included kimchi, black beans, potatos, courgettes, cucumbers etc in a variety of Korean spicy and non-spicy preparations. The waitress again was able to tell us what everything was in English which was a great help. The price of the food wasn't the cheapest in Berlin but the portion sizes and the little extras really made up for it and it wasn't overly expensive anyway at 9-15 euros for a main course. Although we didn't have any of the BBQ menu as we only had one meat eater and it's for a minimum of two, we did see other diners having it and it looked excellent. Overall I recommend this restaurant."
Mai Linh?s,Thai,5,,5,1/31/16,"Mai Linhs is great! Best option is to come with a group and all get something different so you can try everything! (Everything is delicious) I usually get the fried chicken or duck or the mango chickenIt's a really cozy family owned restaurant, the owner cooks everything himself so be a little patient but it's totally worth it! Also really affordable~Sehr gut Essen !"
Mai Linh?s,Thai,5,,5,5/2/16,"Cheap good Asian food! Went here frequently for a hardy dinner after Uni, or a day in the mitte. The portions are large and totally worth the money."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/10/17,"Authentic Northern Chinese cuisine ... even the atmosphere is authentic (ie more Neon than nostalgic ;) ) Chinese. Great food with pork as mainstay. Oh, and craft beers. Best to come with at least 3 diners to samples some variety (Chinese, not European dishes served here)."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,1/25/18,Went to DJL for dinner. Authentic Chinese food and service was pretty good too. Food was served fast.
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,2,6/11/17,"If this is the best Chinese food that Berlin had to offer... wow... maybe someone should take a trip to China. Although the service was friendly and the menu seeming authentic with the inclusion of a few north eastern Chinese dishes, this is meals are aimed at the German palate, if your palate favors the toning down of flavors this place is for you. When it comes to looking for authentic tasting food, I'll steer clear of local reviewers thanks. Although I did have pretty tasty Chinese food in Frankfurt, so maybe it's just a Berliner thing."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,9/22/17,"Authentic cuisine, pretty good! We enjoyed the cucumber salad/ dumplings/ salt and pepper prawns/ bok choy w shiitake/ sour soup fish."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2/9/16,"Relatively cheap and pretty authentic chinese restaurant. The servers are super nice and friendly so I want to give 5 stars for that.Food was also pretty authentic although the choice was a bit limited. The duck was pretty good and crispy but yuxiangrousi ???? was a bit too sweet. The fried rice was ok. And the bokchoy and mushroom was good ????. Guobai ?? was great (i believe the place is ?? dongbei food. They also gave us free white rice! The food took a while to come out and the choice was somehow more limited than in the Bay area/california (i know this sounds weird since they have pages of food but they lack some super common authentic chinese dishes--- which to be fair not many people might order those here?) Otherwise, super good service, tasty food at decent price! Cannot ask for more for a chinese restaurant in Berlin!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/4/17,"Very good place for dinner, friendly servers, some dishes can serve up to two people. I recommend asking for the spring roll of entry - 2.80 euros. Recommend the dish with chicken fingers and vegetables - 9.90 euros."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,11/20/16,"Very authentic Chinese restaurant. Everything is well prepared and tasty, even the ""Westernized"" dishes.Service is a bit quirky but friendly. Totally recommended"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/27/16,"This restaurant is a little out of the way but totally worth the trek. The food is very good and the service is wonderful. If you're unsure, the front part of the menu has photos of each item to help with your decision. If you want good Chinese food while in Berlin, Da Jia Le is worth a stop."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/12/15,"I've bookmarked this for the longest time, and finally, I got the chance to get here. Oh, how wonderful!It's always a joy to find a Chinese restaurant that doesn't tailor its cuisine to the ""needs"" of the local population. Hence, when I was living in the US, I always sought these little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants because I didn't really dig General Tso's Chicken. And so here in Berlin, I am glad to have found this.One tip: if you ever try and eat here, don't order from the menu that has no pictures. Order from the menu that has pictures. The picture-less menu is your standard Chinese fare that you would expect every Chinese restaurant would carry. But the menu with the pictures, those are the bomb!We ordered three dishes which we shared between the two of us. We ordered the beef tripe (D03), the seaweed salad (D12), and the pork belly stewed in tomatoes with glass noodles (D33). All the dishes were amazing!And surprisingly, they also have quite a good selection of German craft beers, which definitely work well with the hot dishes that they have!I would definitely try to be back here when I can. But first I'll try to exercise and burn away this meal I ate."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/6/14,"I like the food here. You can choose between the western Chinese style or the transitional style. Both of them taste good for me. Das Essen schmeckt mir gut. Mann kann zwischen der westlichen chinesischen Art und der traditionellen chinesischen Art ausw?hlen. Beide gefallen mir. Lecker. :)"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/16/15,"After living in Beijing for almost 4 years then moving to Berlin 2.5 years ago I've been craving REAL Chinese food and I'm very pleased to say I've found it! Authentic dishes,  superb flavours and very nice staff (they even kindly put up with my terrible out of practice Chinese!). Another delightful surprise was the great selection of craft beers on their menu BONUS! But I stayed faithful and had a Tsingtao to truly have my ? Chinese fix. Do yourself a favour and go eat some real Chinese food,  you will not regret it."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/13/15,"Well tickle me pink!  I had gone past this restaurant so many times and thought ummm meh because I have to admit it's not so welcoming looking from the outside. I also peered through the windows at night whilst passing in the car a couple of times and thought nah! Then I saw the reviews on yelp and thought seriously?Having joined the yelp community and met some of the reviewers I thought...Yes seriously this must be good. So I took my little cold to try out something spicy.Well we only ordered three dishes, I would have liked to have gone all Asian but I would have needed the stomach of a cow with it's four chambers to get through it all... on that subject you can indeed order stomach, trotters, tripe and the like should you so wish. We ordered Sichuan Style Tofu, Peking styled fried pork with pancakes and the Pork, shrimp, egg and vegetable dumplings. The dumplings were a good size and tasty. The tofu was firm and had a lovely spice to it, just right to unblock my nose! The pork wrapped in pancakes was delicious too. Portions are generous and we were really quite stuffed. Thankfully my friend knows me quite well and stopped me ordering by the third dish otherwise I would still be there eating now! I liked this place very much and will return to try other dishes. But my main mission will be to find people who have a stomach for the more adventurous side of the menu. Really want to try their intestines, hope it's like how my father used to make them. So many dishes to try! Just happy this place is so nearby and to think I have been searching for so long! Prices are a little on the steep side but I have to come to terms with that when it comes to Chinese food unless you get a greasy noodle box from some public transport station, but that is a whole different ball game!Oh I should also mention they have an impressive selection of craft beers too!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/27/16,"The food was really good and the service was great! My favourites were duck with shrimps and for desert the caramelised sweetpotatoes!Wonderful!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,3/30/16,"Probably some of the best Chinese I've had in Berlin... I can't say I've tried every place but everything I ordered was really fresh and tasty. The portions were actually quite large as well so you get your money's worth!Also they have some local craft beer selections which is a plus!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/8/15,"Last time I tried the Sichuan-style chicken, which blew me away. I needed to give them one more star just for that dish.I asked them about Hunan food in Berlin and they recommended another place not too far away which I tried, too."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,6/9/15,"I ate here last week and had a really delicious meal.  The restaurant is in a kind of odd location - just down from the Yorkstrasse station in an area of mostly apartment buildings and sp?ti.  It took us a second to figure out how to get inside the restaurant...turns out there are sliding doors on the right!  The interior is nothing special, just the typical Chinese restaurant stuff, but it was quiet and the booths felt intimate. The menu is quite large!  I had difficulty picking something out from all of the options.  Eventually we settled on a chicken and a pork dish (I don't remember the names because they were Chinese!) and some pork & shrimp dim sum.  Both of our dishes were awesome!  Especially the pork, which was cut into very thing strips like straws.  The dim sum was very good but it took a loooong time to come out; we had nearly finished our entrees before it was delivered. One cool thing about this place is that they serve craft beer!  I was impressed with the beer selection and, although I opted for a Rollberg on draft this time, was excited to see so many unique options. All in all, it was really nice and I would definitely go back!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/20/14,"This place is incredible! I live only 2 blocks away and just discovered the place! The waitress was super friendly and the food was exceptional! I never write reviews on Yelp, but This place was too good for me not to. If you want delicious authentic Chinese food with big portions, this is the place to GO!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/23/16,"Food: Authentic, delicious, and freshest ingredients. Drinks: Selected craft beers and top notch wines for an affordable price.Service: Run by a sweet and friendly family.Perfection!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/29/16,"Wow, this is a great chinese restaurant. Already when you enter the restaurant you somehow feel you are in China. The decor is a bit tacky and the place itself has a very large dining room with a lot of tables. The food is really great, I would rate it as the best Chinese food I had in Berlin. We went for the cold potato salad and the squid for starters, both excellent. For mains we had some steamed fish and fried sweet and sour pork. The dishes were just excellent and on top of all this great food this place also has a craft beer list that matches some fancy bars in Berlin. A full thumbs up in every aspect."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,5/20/16,One thing for sure. Check their fish menu! Everything is the next-door-girl but their Fish is a diva.
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/6/18,"Wawa serves very large bibimbab bowls and I have to admit that I like that. I like the concept of creating your own bowl by choosing the toppings since this gives me more options as a vegan.Apart from bibimbab they have some of the Korean classics such as bulbogi (not for vegans), mandu, pajeon etc. Everything is really well prepared and well seasoned. My fried mandu came with some pickled radish that balanced the flavour nicely.The staff also brought us a special birthday pancake (a sweet pajeon with nuts and brown sugar) which was super nice.This venue is a lot of fun for omnivores and vegetarians/vegans."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,1/8/18,"Food was nice, but the service not so much. I booked a table and the wanted to give us a sit in the small bar close to the door (kind of a ""waiting area "") but we said no and waited standing to other table to finish"
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,12/27/17,"OUTSTANDING!! From the moment I enter the door the staff was friendly and provided excellent service. The food was just amazing! I was lucked to get a seat without reservations but like I said the staff was able to fit me in, so make reservations! Thanks WaWa for a great dinning experience!"
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,11/11/17,"3 stars because you don't grill the meat yourself at your table. Flavor wise, excellent. I asked for ""half scharf"" bulgogi I which is between the normal non spicy and very spicy and it opened my sinuses but didn't cause tears. Wait staff speaks great English and explain how to do eat each dish if you look confused. The decor is stylish, great for date night. Only good for 1st date if both over Korean bbq. They give you this little roled up wetnap for your hands, NOT EDIBLE. I didn't try but I was like ""was ist das????"" Menu is German and English. Vibing music for the decor and clientele. On Friday and Saturday have a reservation or come close to opening. I got there at 6pm on a Saturday with no reservation and they were booked up from 7pm onward. Not too loud either!"
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,6/1/17,"I am a fan of Korean food and this place doesn't disappoint -- neither does the Kimchi. Whenever I am in the neighborhood I try to stop by. Prices are okay, wish they were a bit lower."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/11/15,"Wow, I have to say the food of Wawa is simply amazing. I haven't tasted such great Bibimbap for ages since I moved here. I have tried several Korean restaurants already, but surely this is the best one so far.The restaurant itself isn't so big, the design inside is quite simple, very down to earth. Great place to hang out with friends. There is a bus stop and U-bahn station Kleistpark close by, it took around 6 mins to get from one to another. I went there with my partner and friends, we all enjoyed the food really much. I had Mandu as the starter, it looked just like dumpling, but in Korean style. It tasted great. My main dish was Bibimbap with Bulgogi (beef), like I mentioned before, it was amazing. Haven't had something like this for a long time. I also tried the Bulgogi dish a bit. Super, both of them recommended. For dessert, I had the Hott?k, which recommended by our waiter. It looked a bit dull, but tasted surprisingly great. For me, one round was definitely enough, it was quite sweet.At the end, I think this place is amazing. Great service, delicious food and great price. If you like Asian food lover or particular Korean kitchen fan, there is surely the place to go."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/3/17,Sooo delicious! The staff is also very friendly. I became a regular customer in the past 1 year. I would recommend to reserve before going.
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,2/25/15,"Short story: food is very delicious, staff is extremely friendly, lovely atmosphere and enough space for everybody, great place to meat friends for a lunch or to be alone if you desire so. One of the best Korean Restaurants so far.Long story: I have been here as part of Yelp Elite Event. Staff of Wawa organized everything very well, so the event went smooth. In my opinion, they had really good choice of food. Sadly, we did not try any Ramen (being a Korean TV-Series junkie I know they love it), but we were so full that we couldn't possibly try anything else :-) It was really funny to make a wrap with salad, rice, meat and paste and put it in your mouth - I mean the whole thing! Delicious :-)Weird, but I've never been here before. And it is indeed weird, because I live just around the corner and am a huge fan of Korean food. Location is lovely - red color rocks! Service is exclusively friendly and polite. I think it'll be good for a lunch with friends or eat by yourself and enjoy the atmosphere.5 stars, because I have nothing to complain about :-)"
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,2/15/15,"Nice cute westernized version of Korean cuisine. Missed the onslaught of pickled vegetables. Mandu had a nice crispy skin but the filling was kind of plain. The bulgogi beef lettuce wraps were wonderful  especially the dipping sauce. The savory Korean pancake was good but not extraordinary. The ambiance is tasteful and modern but the heating reminded me of China in the winter - cold air coming through the wall that opens completely in the summer and must be great for sitting outside. The prosecco was unimpressive, the Saar ros? very nice for the price (?13)! The waiters were friendly and polite. It feels like a family business which is nice. Verdict:We liked this restaurant and will be back - a new corner of the city for us - but we're spoiled by the very good Korean restaurants in Guatemala City (who'd have thought)."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,2,2/1/16,"Got the veggie mandu and bibimbap. The former were great, but as for the latter -- everything was fine except the rice, which amounted to the whole affair being the worst bibimbap I've ever had. (Which, to put in perspective, isn't that catastrophic, since it was all in all still a fine, edible lunch.) The best I can describe it is dry and broken instead of the wonderful elastic chewiness for which I dragged my been-sick-for-going-on-a-week ass out of bed, down four flights of stairs, through January drizzle, three bus stops north. And to top it off, there wasn't an egg topping it off (or rather, there wasn't even such an option).Good service and a lovely interior, though."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,9/1/14,"I love this fairly new Korean which has opened up by me. The menu is limited: 3 starters, 4 mains, 2 of which offer variations, 2 sides and 2 desserts... but what they do, they do extremely well. The food is melt in your mouth delicious!I had a craving for Asian food after my craving for tacos in a nearby restaurant was quashed due to it being closed. Besides, I had wanted to come here since it was opened. The place is decked out in a simple contemporary way. The service team were efficient and courteous. It was around 9.45pm when we arrived and the place was half full. We took a seat outside because it was relatively warm.To start we had the Edamame and an order of Mandu. Both were very good, the Edamame were perfectly seasoned and the Mandu, just right with a crunchy pickle garnish.  For his main dish my bf had the So-Bulgogi , a huge portion of marinated beef which was served rice, kimchi and  some sort of Ssamjang (Mixed Soybean & Chili Pepper Paste) dip.  It also came with Lettuce so you could make Ssam if you prefer (lettuce wraps). Well he was very pleased indeed with his choice and I could taste why.  The beef was just melted on your tongue.  It was so good, it cost ?12.50 but like I said it was a huge portion and perfected prepared.For my main I decided to try the Bibimbap with Dweji -Bulgogi (marinated pork) for ?8.50. The portion was also huge and though the dish was hot it didn't really sizzle so there was less crunch at the bottom which I do confess I like! Having said that, it really was very, very good!  The ingredients were carefully prepared and very fresh. Up until now I had only ever had Bibimbap with a fried egg on top at WaWa they replace it with cut strips of egg instead.  I wondered if this would alter the dish somehow in terms of taste and texture but it didn't. Very tasty indeed!The other customers seemed happy as Larry too as we exchanged glances of. I will be coming here again. I couldn't manage dessert as I was absolutely stuffed but you can bet I will be updating you on that as soon as possible!All in all, a lovely little Korean restaurant!"
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,8/12/15,"4.5 stars for lovely easygoing atmosphere and service, 3.5 for food. Had the beef and veg bibimbap, which were both enjoyable, but didn't reach into the fantastic or memorable realm. Will go again for sure to try the bulgogi. Great place to take people to try Korean food, but for one experienced in Korean you may want to play down the food and play up the atmosphere."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,2/24/15,"Few steps away from the U-Bahn Stations Eisenacher Str/Kleistpark, and right in the middle of the chilled out but cool area of Berlin-Sch?neberg.The staff has the well known asian friendly aura, and speaks fluent english . They were friendly enough to assist me in using the korean chopsticks, how to follow the Korean dinner etiquette , and most importantly how to eat!Loved the lettuce wraps that you can do yourself. It has a social touch, where you try things with your friends and switch between the ingredients.The korean beer tasted more like german beer....which is good enough for me.perfect 5 stars."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,10/27/14,"I tend to agree with the other reviewers in that Wawa seems to be the best Korean in the area. Their chilli paste isn't super spicy but gets the job done. Daytime offerings are a few different kinds of Bibimbap and a few soup variations. The kimchee is fresh, not fermented and they offer a not spicy one as well.I understand there's more on offer evenings though..."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,7/27/15,"The food was good for a Korean restaurant in berlin.  However, the korean food experience is diminished by the lack of the plethora of banchan, or korean side dishes.  Even the kimchi, a must at the korean, table was not offered with the meal, but as a purchased side dish.  The prices are reasonable, but guests should be offered selected banchan for no cost."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,9/24/15,Very cozy place with super nice people. The food I have had better in other Korean restaurants but this one is unbeatable when it comes to atmosphere and service!
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/6/16,"This was my first visit to a Korean restaurant ever.  We asked the waitress for suggestions and she explained what were the more traditional dishes and also how you eat them - very important when your meal is delivered with about 5 or 6 dishes together (sides, sauces, etc.).  The lettuce wrap dish was SUPER hot.  Good taste but wow, be careful."
WaWa,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,3/31/16,"This is a very good, authentic Korean restaurant in a very pleasant setting at Grunewaldstrasse in Sch?neberg. Frequented by lots of Asians ( Koreans?) which is slways a good sign. They only have a limited menu but everything is delicious. Prices are really reasonable. Excellent small restaurant!"
Ampai,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,3/22/15,"The Guay Jap soup is to die for. Even if you don't like anything other than traditional cuts (so for example you don't like Liver, etc) you should order the soup because of the broth -- just don't eat the parts you don't like. Insanely good -- I dream of this soup."
Ampai,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,1/11/16,Looks like canteen and there's no pleasure of eating there. Food quality not so bad but they should definitely make bigger portions or lower prices. Not the place you want to come back.
China-Restaurant Bambus,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,1/14/09,"I tried only once, the buffet.From 1 (worst) to 5 (best)Food taste: 2 No better than imbiss (take away cafe).Food variety: 1 Fewer than 10 meals for buffet.Price: 2 Expensive for take-away quality.Mobility: Easy to reach. Recommendation and comment:Will not step in again."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/22/17,"Excellent and dedicated service. Took the time to present and discuss a wide variety of wines befitting the dishes we had chosen.The food was absolutely splendid, especially the Korean bbq was worth a mention.Will happily return on my next visit in Berlin."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,1/27/16,"In a word - a fusion of Spanish and Korean food, not only sounds interesting but also tastes good! Longer version (for the brave) - so I got here a while ago with a friend who always wanted to try it out, we even reserved a table just to make sure we won't miss it. As we got there we did get a pretty good table but then turned out wrong as they moved us due to a mistake, I was a bit upset because the new seat was right in the middle of the restaurant (which is small, meaning everything and everyone passing next to you) - so we received a glass of sparkling wine as compensation without even asking, overall, despite the seat - it was a very pleasant experience.The staff is very nice, English speaking and professional, they indeed contributed a lot to make the evening better than expected. So there are the obligatory tapas with a Korean twist, so we took a starter that combined the two - with manchego cheese (my personal fav) and kimchi, sort of a quesadilla (you'll have to forgive my poor memory) - which tasted absolutely fantastic. Then for the main dish I have ordered bibimbap and my friend ordered a salad with prawns and seaweed, my friend really liked his dish, and mine was pretty good -Decent size, great flavors and all the little extras on the size (a.i - kimchi, sauce etc.)They also have beef dishes that looked pretty amazing and even made me somewhat regretful I haven't ordered that steak! Next time maybe ;)To sum it up - it's not a place I would go to daily, but every now and then, when you feel like trying something a little different and enjoy a fine evening - this is it, they definitely have a lot to offer! Reserve yourself a table, the place is pretty small."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,3,5/27/16,"Dinner based on a recommendation. Unusual mix of korean and spanish food...kimchi tapas... the starters were quite good while the mains had mixed reviews from the group. Esp the vegetarian main, a salad, disnt get much praise. The service was ok but nit great amd the waiting time for the main by far too long. Popular place so a reservation is highly recommended !"
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/14/14,"The lunch special was better than I expected, which included beet soup, rice cakes (authentic) and dessert, overall it was good value for 8 euros. I would come back to try the ""Korean tapas."" I found it interesting to find no Koreans working in the restaurant and some of the service was a bit spotty, but overall I enjoyed the meal and would come back."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/9/14,"We had dinner here last night. We enjoyed the food and the warm service. It was a quiet night in the restaurant, which we loved. We had the kimchee, an aubergine dish, and croquettes filled with curried sweet potato to start. Every dish was flavorful and delicious. We enjoyed vegetarian bibimbap for our main, followed by a dark chocolate mousse with pear gelato and fresh quince for dessert. The Rioja by the glass is excellent value for money.If you are in Berlin, we definitely recommend dining at this restaurant."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/18/16,"Excellent food, a cute restaurant, and reasonably priced booze made this place by far our favorite foodie place we tried in Berlin."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,1,2/15/15,"The ""BEST"" serviceThe attitude of the Korean boss there was really bad. She was not nice and even a bit rude to my friends. Food was fine but not the best. And they are a bit too overpriced. There are a lot of other nice Korean places here in Berlin so definitely won't go there again."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,3,1/26/15,"The restaurant has an interesting concept, it actually tries to create a fusion of Spanish and Korean cusisine. The decor is very nice and feels intimiate. We got a reservation for the same day, the restaurant can be busy, so reserve in advance. When we arrived it was still quite empty and we where shown a table. We asked if we could change the table as this one was just next to the heating. The waitress denied this saying that the other table was reserved for 1 1/2 hour later. To our surprise a couple that showed up 10 later was given our table of choice and they stayed almost as long as we did, well beyond the mentioned 1 1/2 hour, not very good practice... On to the most important thing, the food. Unfortunately this has been a let down. I am not sure how they made into the Guide Michelin. They offer tapas style Koren food, which I think is an amazing concept (Transit, a restaurant not far, is doing this amazingly since a while now). At Kochu Karu it felt off though. The majority of the dishes are plain Korean, with some offering a Spanish twist. We didn't feel this was successful though. For the octupus chevice the chorizo overpowered the whole dish. The meat skewers were not seasoned enough and the veggies where just plain steamed. The corn pancake was just flavourless and the Gogi dumplings which were served with a Spanish dip were dry. The Japchae salad was the best dish of the night, but also not real must have. In the end the sweet Korean pancakes were overall dry and raw in the middle. With wine we spend 100 EUR for two. I won't go back there."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,4,7/8/13,"During this trip, we were on a mission to try more Korean restaurants that we didn't get around to last year, and I was surprised to find that there were quite a few nearby where we were staying in P'berg.  We went to Kochu Karu (which is red pepper powder used in Korean dishes) on Sun evening.  There weren't a lot customers, and the service was prompt and courteous.  I thought it was nice that the waitress took the time to meticulously explain every dish to us as if it was our first time having Korean food.  I didn't have the heart to tell her that kimchee to me was like sauerkraut to her.  However, considering that Korean cuisine is relatively new in Germany or Europe for that matter, I assumed such lengthy explanation was necessary for most of their patrons.      We ordered Korean tacos, bi bim bop, and so bulgogi.  Bi bim bop was as good as I'd expected with nicely marinated veggies and meats.  The marination of so bulgogi was disappointing, and the quality of the meat was subpar, no better than grilling chopped beef on a hot plate.  Korean tacos, however, was great.  It didn't have a lot of veggies in it, but you get a side of nicely grilled tomatoes and guacamole to put on it if you want, and the meat in the tacos was better marinated than bulgogi.I saw the banchan menu or tapas, as they call it ... ingenious!  Most of the items looked good; however, having spinach and kimchi as tapas is like making sauerkraut a special dish ... a little contrived, I think. All in all, we really enjoyed the meal, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was absolutely charming.  I would definitely go back to Kochu Karu when we're in Berlin again."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/21/13,"We weren't sure what to expect with a fusion place. Was it going to be a cacophony of flavors? Was it going to be overpriced and undersized. Instead - it was lovely. Perfectly located between Eberswalder UBahn & Mauerpark, it's outside tables offered a comfortable place to watch the bustle of those passing by as we enjoyed our food. It was my first try of Bibimbap and though I was sucked in by the name, I loved the flavors. Simple, comforting, delicious.Also - bonus points for good service! Are we still in Berlin? The waitress took the time to explain the menu & concept and the best way to eat our dishes without being pushy or looking bored. Basically a first in this city."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/10/12,"My general understanding of the origins of Korean tacos is that they started with a truck in LA that announces where it will appear on Twitter.  Berlin doesn't seem have anything like food trucks---there's no shortage of restaurant space and petrol is quite a bit more costly than back in the ancestral homeland---but Korean tacos are available in Berlin at Kochu Karu.  They are, after all, destined to take over the world.If you're interested in non-traditional Korean, definitely go check out this place.  The space is great, and food's really well executed.  We had Bibimbap along with the tacos, but will be back to try out the Korean tapas.  I would definitely rate it above Kimchi Princess, which is the only competition I know about in this particular category.  (But if you want a chigae, just go to Madang in Xberg, since they don't have them here.)"
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,4/12/16,one might not expect it but this is a splendid combo of Spanish and Korean modern cuisine! the owner gives explanations and recommendations before ordering and everything is fresh and tasty. thumbs up!!
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,4,6/15/14,Spanish Korean cuisine. Food was good and different but not quite what I would have expected. Octopus salad was very fresh and the dumplings were well seasoned  but overall it was missing this special something that makes you wanna come back all the time. A bit pricy too for Berlin standards.
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,10/24/14,"Friendly waitress, delicious food ! I decided to eat bibimbab there but at that day it's not possible. Because the menu is fixed.  They have only one main course :-( everyday they change the main course so I had no luck that day:-(. But I had noodle and it's very good. I liked it :)"
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,2,5/28/13,Stingy on the Kimchi!! How dare they! Especially when the prices are already higher than other local Korean restaurants.
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,3,1/3/13,"It is a fusion restaurant though so it has the unavoidable lounge music and kind of thought after decoration. I love Bossa Nova but I wish asian restaurants could use something else without fearing to lose western people.As for Korean food, it is decent though noting to dream about either. You do not get metalic chopsticks but the disposable wooden ones; felt a bit weird to me Especially given that the prices are the same as in Korean restaurants (the really good ones) you find in Paris.To wrap it up :Very kind service, decent though not memorable food, fusion clich? ambiance, rather high prices for the area IMO.30% Quality, 70% Hype. Berlin usual ratio."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/13/12,"After Louis T's brief but convincing discourse on Korean tacos, I headed over to Kochu Karu to try. The place is pretty charming, with a nice exposed ceiling. I think those tacos are really pretty good -- well stuffed with pulled pork and beans , with sides of kimchi, light guacamole, soya sprouts and good blanched tomatos. Just good. Next time I am going to try one of their specials, which I totally ignored. They're also serving ""Korean Tapas"" - smaller plates at EU 3.50. I'll be back to try those, too."
Kochu Karu,Korean,4,?11-20,5,10/20/13,"We tried it on a Saturday evening having a reservation. It's a small restaurant with just few tables but has a nice atmosphere. The service team was really helpful to make our choice for dishes. We tried some starters and main dishes which all have been really yummy. The best starter was the grilled spinach, but also the kimchi and the squid were tasty. As main dish we had udon noodles with pumpkin and grilled pork. We enjoyed both. The service was really attentive and cheerful with some good recommendations. Wine was pleasant. We had a nice evening and the price was adequate for that quality in Berlin. We will come back to try more. We tried it a second time for a 5 course menu and enjoyed a very happy evening with surprisingly gorgeous dishes and singing. We've been really satisfied even given the higher costs for that kind of menu. Quality was even better than the last time, the dessert was fantastic."
Duc Anh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/24/14,"You can eat  some great Pho here. Most cost around 6,- and are very tasty. Lots of Vietnamese dining here so it must be good. Service is fast and friendly."
Duc Anh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/20/12,"Just had awesome B?n cha there! Great, fresh, healthy."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/3/14,"Best Chinese I know. Always delicious and friendly. Very reasonably priced as well.Lunch menue is unbeatable in quality and price! Tastebuds what'ya say ?YUMMIE"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,7/26/17,"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Food is great, spicy but acceptable because of the quality and the freshness of the food. Lots of Chinese restaurant is using glutamates to cover and give the impression of Chinese food. Here none, it's just well prepared with delicious and fresh vegetables. We loved it really!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,6/8/15,"Really good Chinese food! Had spicy chicken with pineapple, carrots and peppers. It was really solid. Nice interior, very clean and modern, white tablecloth kinda place. Very nice service and a menu in English. Much appreciated!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/1/14,"Been here twice. Great Chinese food! The chicken was tender and fresh and the veggies were perfect. Friendly, fast service as well. Nice quiet neighborhood to walk around in as well. Will definitely come back for the dim sum which looked delicious."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,9/11/14,"Not bad, it's exactly Chinese style. The boss is from Zhejiang, the soup is good, home style."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/18/11,"Great authentic Chinese food at reasonable price. The location is great although it might have been a little cosier if the lighting would have been a little bit darker.I tried a very spicy chicken, believing it would be Sichuan spicy. This was not the case. The chicken was great but not as spicy as expected.I would easily recommend this place!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,1/29/11,At the moment this is one of my favourite chinese restaurant in Berlin. The food is delicious!
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,2/25/16,"This location has been moved a few blocks west of its original location.I got a bibim box (or however you spell it) and it was very very good. Wish it was a little spicier for Korean food though. Also it's a little bit pricer than most places in Berlin, but still worth the ?5-7."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,7/24/17,"Mwoa..Burger was ok, not great. Price for the burger was ok too. But with fries and a drink the meal is waaaaaaaay overpriced at 15 euro's."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,3/19/16,"We were getting drinks in the area in was looking for a quick place to grab a bite to eat. Ban Ban Kitchen was nearby so we gave it a try and made it right before it closed. The kimchi fries were delicious! The nori tacos were ok, it can get a bit messy to eat. The kimchi box looked pretty good. It's mostly a one person operation.. order taker/cashier and then he turns around and starts cooking. There were no lines when we arrived but while we were eating, numerous people came in and had to wait. There's limited seating (about 3 tables inside). If you're vegetarian, there's a soy super veggie option."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,2,10/2/16,"Overpriced and not very tasty.  Bulgogi Bim Box quite average, too many flavors literally mushed in together."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,9/8/14,"I've walked by this place on an almost daily basis since the start of Summer. Today was one of those ""oh crap Fall is literally around the corner"" days and we decided to order some Ban Ban Kitchen and take a seat outside.My boyfriend and I both ordered the Chicken Nori Tacos and the Seoul Fries. I think the nori tacos are a great concept. They're composed of two, maybe three sheets of nori (seaweed) with a layer of white rice, possibly mayo, cabbage, and grilled chicken. I wolfed them down quickly letting my hands get messy as any proud American would (Kein Gabel bitte!). The Seoul Fries were steak fries sprinkled with chili powder and served with soy sauce (to dip). I forgot how much I love steak fries. The chili powder was a nice touch but I lost a lot of it when I used my napkin to wipe off the excess salt. I had never thought to use soy sauce as a dip before because of the high sodium content but it's worth it! There is limited seating, which will probably be non-existent come winter but they do takeaway. The hut itself is super cute and built around a huge tree. We waited no more than ten minutes for our food.*One Week Later*I tried the Kimchi Fries and loved them. They're steak fries with kimchi (I have been missing some spice in Berlin) with chicken. They're simple in context but not simple in taste."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,1/14/15,"Oh boy oh boy oh boy, I was never so excited to write a review! I've been living in Berlin for a while now and every time I passed by this place I was either on my way somewhere or it was closed.My first experience with Korean food wasn't too good but I felt like I can relate to some of the foods that they offer, so this place seemed to me like an easy start.If you don't know it, it's a very small place that looks like a shack, and the tree inside makes it even smaller, there are very few chairs and two people in the counter/kitchen- So the main idea is that you can choose between chicken beef or soy that come inside or on top of seaweed tacos, fries, burger or bibimbap (sorry if it's spelled wrong)The guy at the counter was really nice and helpful and recommended to my friend who couldn't decide.Not too long after we got our dishes- they were not too big but very yummy-My friend had chicken with seaweed taco and I had bulgogi beef on kimchi friesThe sauces and flavors were really good! And it was very warm and cosy inside, despite the small size of the place.The drinks section is also pretty fascinating because some of the drinks they offer are not very popular in other places... A.i ginger beer or aloevera drink.I'm coming again for sure"
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,9/9/14,There is barely something as nice as nori tacos in the middle of the night. For real. I mean it! Ban Ban kitchen is a small cosy food stall randomly set on the side way which offers some pretty good S(e)oul food. The kitchen is Asian fusion and you have the choice between burgers with kimchi and bulbogi or tacos wrapped in seaweed with rice and other yummy toppings. Ever wondered if kimchi goes well with fried? They do! Try it here! Their menu isn't huge but everything is so good that in the end you want to order all of it. And to be fair...  Do it. #yolo
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,10/26/15,"Good burgers and fries are also delicious. I am a huge kimchil fan so to have fries smothered in kimchi is like a dream made from heaven. Its a great place to go for food on the run or in the summertime, grab it to go and head to the Tempelhofer Feld just a hop skip and jump away. This downed with some beer is a defo great quick dinner that is cheap and satisfying. My only wish is that the burger meat was all together and not chopped up to bits. Not a fan of that."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,1,6/12/16,"We are very disappointed. We were expecting to try some different food, but it tasted like warmed up leftovers. To add, each meal costs around 6eur."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,3/9/16,"Always great! Only thing I don't like on the menu are the Nori Tacos but everything else is delicious. The dishes could be tiny bit bigger to be honest. The new location at Schillerpromenade is a bit more modest, I liked the raw garage atmosphere a bit better but this is also nice."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,1/19/15,"really tasty, fast, friendly, nice price, nice place, sense of design. its really nice in summer.i tried nori tako, and bibim box with chicken.they created really good in 'fushion food'im korean, but its also good taste for me too.most of korean restaurants which ive tried were a bit only for 'Ausl?nder(foriegner)' but ban ban kitchen mixed very well.i will try also kimchi pommes next time. there is Hite, korean beer, its fresh and also good for drinking, like coke. many friends of mine love ban ban kitchen also."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,3/27/16,"I had the soy meat burger and it was so tasty! Kimchi and fresh cabbage made for a really nice garnish and the bun was soft outside and crispy inside. The fries were disappointing though - I thought they were a but undercooked and I wish they made sauces free and not 0,50 per serving. I'd like to go back and try the bibim box!"
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,5/18/14,"I loved the chicken nori tacos, inventive Asian comfort/soulfood! I'm coming back for the kimchi fries and doner. Cute streetside shop with really friendly staff."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,11/24/15,Had the soy burger and kimchi fries and they were really tasty but there could be more volume for value on the burger's end.
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,9/22/13,"The Korean tacos are fantastic. You get 2 for 5?. They are delicious. They fill you up.Yes that's maybe a euro or two more than a d?ner, but please support these guys, I've had enough d?ner for a thousand lifetimes."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,9/18/14,"Great Korean fast food place.I just love to eat there every time I'm in this area. Staff is very friendly!The food is really good and at a reasonable price."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,10/15/14,"It's unique fast food that you have to eat on the sidewalk, but we thought it was a little overpriced for streetfood. We were still a little hungry after 2 mains and 1 side."
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,4/14/15,The food and service is great as is the location and vibe. I really like to eat here but I also prefer Mmaah which serves similar food nearby. I was a little disappointed by the size of the portion of fries considering the price but the rest of the food was a good portion and delicious so it's a minor negative. They are also always playing music that I like which is a plus.
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,8/29/14,Streetfood Korean Style. Good prices and certainly something different compared to the your regular D?ner. Recommended.
Ban Ban Kitchen,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,12/7/14,"This is one of my favourite places in Neuk?lln. Inexpensive, tasty, spicy good comfort soul food with a Korean touch.  The kimchi fries with bulgogi beef are absolutely delicious! Very original. I can really recommend this place."
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/14/16,"Awesome, homely, well balanced, healthy and tasty food!! A regular visitor to this place. Lovely people who make yummy food! Would recommend this eat out whole heartedly!"
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,3,6/23/17,"Very cute neighborhood spot for both classics and cool new spins on Korean food. The service is quick and friendly and I like the way the space is set up and how it's decorated. Definitely not the best Korean food I've ever had, and the fact that you have to pay 2 euros for kimchi is a bit ridiculous. However, I would stop in again if I'm in the area."
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/14/16,"The place is cute, but we tried the bibimbap (too salty) and the japchee (not enough flavor) and also the seeweed salad, which was also too salty. They had a new employee who was struggling to do the cash register and she also made the salads, which could explain that, but unfortunately the main dishes were also way too salty."
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/8/15,"Nearby, nice 'n cozy atmosphere and you get served a delicious bibimbap. The owners refine the taste of everything such as the seaweed salad or homemade gochuang paste (a spicy red chilli paste). The bibimbap was unlike many other restaurants made as it is supposed to be with many fresh ingredients and superb beef just as I know it from Korea. Also the gluten free desert was a fluffy sweet dream. Thank you. We come back."
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,3,7/8/16,"Very cute small place. Had tofu bibimbap and it was okay but not exceptional. The red sweet spicy sauce, gochujang was lacking the flavor and needed tiny bit more sesame oil. I am so spoiled and usually when I dine in Korean restaurants in the U.S., they give at least 5 of free dishes, banchan, usually, kimchi, bean sprouts, potato salad, seaweed, tofu etc and with this place, it cost extra bucks to order kimchi. I know things are different depending on places. I am grateful that I can still have one of my favorite food in Berlin. I would give a big prop for opening up independent Korean joint in Berlin and people seems to enjoy this place."
Korean Food Stories,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/10/15,"Delicious!! Really good quality for the buck, a great team of people and cool ambience. the bibimaps were incredibly good."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,5,5/4/15,"Service was excellent. Food was delicious and wasn't too salty like most food in Germany. You could taste a lot more of the ingredients more instead of just salt. Dae-Won's open kitchen was also nice to watch.The Herb Salad was fresh and tasty. The Root Vegetables were also delicious.The King Crab was tasty and came with breaded oysters which were great. The blue fin tuna sashimi was extremely high quality. It was served with fresh wasabi grinded right at the table.The Galbi was fall off the bone tender and the pork belly was also tasty.The Chili-Chocolate Mousse was tasty and not too heavy after a big meal."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,3,8/9/17,The food was really tasty but when I ordered a glass of wine it was marginally larger than the taste I received.
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,4,8/12/15,"Didn't expected this. It was amazing. Wellmade fusion korean dishes based on korean cusine factors and I gradients. We ordered vegi course and yachae, galbi, bingsu, ginGer something and dakgogi. Except biBimmyun(was too oily.), everything was good. Compare with other korean restaurants of course much more expensive but I like really restaurant concept and design. And service too."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,1,6/18/16,"Food was fine.  As menus were being handed out I mentioned to my dinner mates why don't we get some bubbly.   Server returned, tried to order sparkling wine at 45 euro.  Server had come out with a bottle in hand.  He said it was his recommendation.  I asked again for the 45 euro bottle, server told me they were sold out and pointed to another that was 65 euro instead.  At this point we had been talking for much too long at the table, I just told him to pour the bottle he had in his hand after he suggested it again.  Check came, bottle was the most expensive on the menu at 145 euro.  Totally unscrupulous, stay away."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,4,4/3/15,"Top shelf ingredients with creative touches to Korean cuisine. The gambari(sp?) nori and rice constellation is very nice: picked vegetables, delicious slices of omelet, a bean-rice sashimi decorated with nasturtiums. Carabinieri: The oysters breaded in crushed seaweed are amazing. They fill the oyster shells with a seaweed salad, light and refreshing. The pork belly with fresh beans was also fantastic - the most scrumptious, melt in your mouth pork belly covered in a BBQ sauce. We also had the danchen pickled vegetable small plates that usually come first at a real Korean restaurant - here they're 9?. Very good though: tiny dried fish with a hint of sweetness, soybeans and kimchi - obligatory, all made in house. The decor is beautiful, very modern with Asian influences. The service is particularly professional, attentive and friendly - wow! -an extra star!! We had an excellent sp?tburgunder from Franken, not what you expect in an Korean restaurant but this is Mitte after all. If you want to watch the chefs at work come with a larger group and sit next to the open kitchen in the back. Otherwise it's cosy in the front. Definitely recommendable - many small details make for an excellent experience. Not cheap but worth it."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,5,5/30/16,"Great Asian food, and friendly service. We were a party of four, and all the food was exceptional, except the seafood soup starter, which was a bit tasteless. The tuna avocado, and the mushroom starters both made us want to lick our plates. The pork cheek was the favorite main course, melt-in-your-mouth tender! Would absolutely go back here."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,3,12/19/14,"Expensive but very good food. Takes aprox. 1 h between courses... So be prepared to spend some time waiting."
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,5,8/2/15,"Amazing food, presentation and service. Book a table near the open kitchen, sit back and watch magic happen!"
Dae Mon,Korean,4,?21-40,5,8/5/15,An amazing korean restaurant with creative kitchen. The interior is very cozy and the food just great.
T?nis,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/14/17,"One of the dopest curries I had in Berlin for a ridiculous price. The venue is small and not very cozy (also the interior is a terrible accident of neon green and blue) BUT GOD DAMN THE FOOD.I am a huge fan of cheap asian food because it's usually good enough. But T?nis set a whole new level. The curry is bursting with flavours and fresh vegetables. I absolutely love this ""No time for BS"" attitude: No GMO, No fancy shmanzy interior, No asian fusion hipster bla bla. Straight up solid and delicious food."
T?nis,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/2/16,"This place is rather tiny so I wouldn't recommend it to larger groups BUT I would definitely recommend it to everyone else! My girlfriend loves this place and wanted to show it to me for quite a while already. Now I understand why. The menu offer 13 different options which I appreciate. To me that the stuff they do, they do well! In the main part of the restaurant you basically sit right by the kitchen and see everything that is going on. When we were there, there was a male cook and a tiny (probably vietnames) lady who took care of the guests. She was that kind of lady you want to have up front representing your business - always smiling, having short casual conversation with everyone and just being very nice to the guests in general.About the food... As I mentioned, I had meal number 12 and although I am usually not the biggest rice-eater, I devoured this dish. That should actually say enough about my opinion about the food. I can really understand why people like to come here regularly."
T?nis,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,5/30/16,"Good and cheap, but was not blown away. Expected more since it had a five star rating. I got the curry and it was pretty good but definitely not the best I've had by a long shot. Service was also pretty slow."
T?nis,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/30/16,"Cheap, tasty, fast(unless you arrive at 13-14 during a brake of all the office clercs arround).Meals are nicely balanced and rounded."
T?nis,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/9/11,"T?ni at his best! Really fresh food, good tea (jasmine), nice rice, undisputable facts & folks. Ups! But authentic value! Go for gold! No glutamate  that's what it is :-) We lived here for almost 8 years. And went there for many times.Und auch hier wieder der Vergoldung virtueller Rundst?cke hinterhergehechtet.

Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/16/15,"One of my favorites Viet restaurants in Berlin, Chez Dang is a very cute place with a nice staff. I've tasted many dishes on their menu and I've never been unhappy with what I had (Pad thai, red curry, green curry, sweet and sour chicken...)One of my favorites is the red curry with tofu, it's quite spicy but I loved it every time I had it ! It comes with a lot of fresh vegetables and some rice.The price is definitely fair (around 7? I think), and they have a lot of gluten free options."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,2/2/17,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY. BAD QUALITY. VEGETABLES NOT FRESH. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE COMMENTS HERE WHICH SAY THIS IS THE BEST VIETNAMESE IN BERLIN. I'VE BEEN TO MANY. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST ONES.Well, this was a big disappointment. I've have been to lots of Vietnamese and Asian restaurants in Berlin and the food at Chez Dang is miles away from all the nice things you can have anywhere else in this city. Really, anywhere else. The vegetables were not well-cooked and clearly not fresh, the green beans in the curry came out of a can from Netto. This would be ok or at least more acceptable if the price were a bit lower. Yet, the price for a main course is similar to a main course at Umami or Good Morning Vietnam (on Bergmannstr.), where the food is not sublime but definitely waaaaay better. Places like Pagoda (Thai, also on Bergmannstr.) offer a wide range of main courses for half the money and unlike those at Chez Dang, they are delicious. The food was overall not cooked with love. The curry sauce was watery and the rice really mediocre for a Vietnamese eatery. The only good thing was the service, really nice and friendly as well as quick. Definitely NO VALUE FOR MONEY and NOT GOOD FOOD FOR A NICE DINNER. This is a place where I would pay up to 5? for a lunch package. Not a place to enjoy a nicely made curry with your friends in the evening.CONCLUSION: DO NOT GO THERE IF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS NICE VIETNAMESE FOOD. You can buy curry paste and coconut milk at an Asian supermarket and make an awesome curry at home yourself with fresh veggies that do not come out of a can and spend 3? instead of 10?.A HUUUUUGE disappointment considering the array of Asian, Vietnamese, and Thai restaurants in Berlin which offer way better food for half the price. NOT WORTH IT."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,8/11/16,Best asian food in Neuk?lln. I would solely live off the spicy beef salad if that was'nt so embarrassing...
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,5/16/16,Pretty mediocre to be frank. Atmosphere and interior is pretty nice but the food is only okay.
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,3/4/16,"Very good lunch soup one day, very tasty dinner another time! Love this place, like the deco which is s simple tasty affair, and staff is very friendly and fast. No hesitation to call it the best Asian around, and one among the best restaurant in all categories around."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,11/6/14,"Super cheap and tasty (quite spicy) Asian food.Friendly staff, very fast service (food is usually served within 5-10 min)"
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,12/9/14,"The Chez Dang is an honest petite Thai style (Lao). We were there yesterday and had the daily dish for EUR 5,90, vegetables, coconut milk, peas, lime leaf, fish sauce served with rice and with Chicken or Tofu. Both dishes were fine for the money and what is most important, fresh and savory. The decor is typical for Neuk?lln/Kreuzberg, simple room a bit like a bit living room. Pretty good service and fast serving of food. We will come by again to re-try soon and would recommend the Chez Dang to people who enjoy a hearty and healthy dish of great food!"
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/25/15,"The only legitimately spicy (and tasty) Thai food that I've had in Berlin. I'm a HUGE spice fiend and as other spice fiends will know, Berlin's spicy game is weak. Come here for some delicious and fiery dishes. I had the shredded duck salad."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,2/23/15,"Food is really yummy, and service is very nice. Not the best looking place, but still worth it."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,9/8/14,I ordered the daily menu what was delicious and enough for an all day long wandering in Berlin. I really liked the green tea with lemon grass what was available as an option in the daily menu. Alltogether it was only 10 ? and totally worth it.
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,11/6/13,"This place has a very nice atmosphere, very small but with friendly staff (something that is apparently rare here in Berlin). I had the noodles with vegetables and beef (#13) with was OK. Not enough beef for me and a little too bland. My sister had the ""Monsoon Wedding"" (#10) which was a very cool dish, kind of a combination between an omelette and a crepe filled with vegetables and a topping of your choice, we took the prawns which great but we wanted to have the pork, but they didn't have any left. All in all it's probably the best Vietnamese restaurant, but it just wasn't my cup of tea."
Chez Dang,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,3/13/13,The soups are great but the other dishes I've tried suffer from an overdose of sweet and sour sauce. If you're within walking distance from Jimmy Woo you sort of need to make a little bit more of an effort.
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,12/31/16,"For Chinese Food in Berlin on New Years Eve, without reservations, this was a solid choice.  Service was fast, the menu was extensive, and the dishes I ordered were perfect.  It's a large ""hall"" style Chinese restaurant, with a lot of tables, and a few smaller seating areas built inside, but it wasn't too noisy, and didn't feel cramped at all.I'd definitely go back if I wanted Chinese food and were in Mitte."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,8/4/16,"I am not really a Chinese enthusiast, but the food, service, and location is good. I ordered the mini vegetable egg rolls, fried noodles with chicken, fried noodles with beef, chicken, and another meat that I can't remember, and fried rice.  I would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,6/4/16,"The most authentic Chinese restaurant I found so far in Berlin, should not be missed for ones looking for real Chinese foods but western Asian."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,5/19/15,"As a suggestion from one of my co-workers in Berlin, I ate here with my boss during a business trip to Berlin for dinner.  What a great choice!The service was fast, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was okay.  Plus it was in walking distance from the Courtyard Marriott where we were staying.Another place on my list when staying in Berlin."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,3/27/15,"Lots of options but the quality isn't that great. The staff is helpful. I do like the ambience. Spacious. I got the fried noodles with chicken, beef and vegetables. It was a bit too oily and not all that flavourful. For what you pay you can get better portions elsewhere."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,3/15/16,Too much MSG and the green peppers tasted moldy. might have been my taste buds so I give three stars. overall quite generic.
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,6/15/14,"Avoid at all costs if you don't to be treated as an intrusion rather than paying customer. I usually trust Yelp reviews because I know the reviewers care about great food as much as I do but this time I totally disagree with previous reviewers.We chose this restaurant due to its closeness to our hotel rather than one with better reviews a distance away.  From the minute we entered I have never encountered such disdain, rudeness and lack of interest on behalf of the restaurant staff.  After 10 minutes after seating we still had not been greeted at table even though only 3 tables filled in restaurant.  Eventually got attention of waiter and the evening went down after.  His attitude was downright hostile - could it have been because we spoke English and not German? We were  a diverse group with Malaysia, Indonesia, Indian and US represented out to have a nice business dinner.Now the food- pan fried dumplings okay, soups poor. Mains- crispy duck in Szechuan sauce & prawns in paprika-pepper both 3.5 stars.  Fried fish filet with mushrooms - no flavor & no fish!  Sweet & sour pork - 2 stars.Decor- dated tacky Chinese decor with abundance of dirty/dusty fake flowers everywhere.All in all- would have give 3 star but cannot tolerate or accept such rude and indifferent wait staff."
China City,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,1/24/13,Very good Chinese restaurant! Cook very fast and delicious! There is always a lot of visitors ... Very often it eat and enjoy!
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,7/21/09,Excelent Thai and Vietnamese food!
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,7/23/17,"The food here was so good, but the woman that waited on us was SO rude. She was unhappy to answer any questions and asked us to hurry because we were taking too long to pay. WHAT. Also, she didn't speak English or German very well"
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,3,8/12/16,"It's cheap. That's the best part of this place. My boyfriend and I ordered pad thai with crispy chicken and the salmon tom yum soup, which were both below average. But again, it was cheap, and service was fast. People watching on the street was fun, and the waitress spoke English. I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone on the basis of food, but we finished our meals and were full, so..."
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,1,11/17/13,"I cannot believe why this place has such a high rating. Perhaps knowing that ruined my experience, because seriously, I have experienced better Thai/Vietnamese places than this one.So my companion and I were here for lunch. We both haven't been here before, so it was a virginal experience for both of us. I ordered the pad thai with tofu (gotta do the pad thai test when I am in a Thai restaurant for the first time), as well as a Vietnamese iced coffee. My companion on the other hand ordered a chicken dish. Oh, he also asked for tap water. But guess what? The staff said ""Ah, tut mir leid, wir haben kein Leitungswasser."" Seriously, you don't have tap water? How tacky.Ok, so my pad thai arrived. And guess what I found? I was expecting to see no meat in it (I ordered the tofu pad thai after all), when there's this renegade piece of duck on my pad thai. It was well-disguised, and I didn't even notice it, until I tasted the fatty piece of poultry. Oh, shall I say that the pad thai noodles were also dry?And I also had high hopes for my Vietnamese iced coffee, expecting this aluminum contraption of coffee brewed right at my table, dripping slowly. But no, it's just your regular run of the mill iced coffee. So why even call it Vietnamese?So no, I refuse to go back here again, knowing that there are better places out there. I did give a 1 EUR tip, but that's where my niceness stops. I am also giving it 1 star, and vow not to go here again."
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,8/23/14,"Good food, good prices and good service:) if you feel lika having asian food and are closeby I strongly recomend tjis place. Its a bit far from aleksanderplats but its worth the walk. I had the housespecial as I always do(if they call something a specialty I always recon its beacause of a reason), it was somekind of chicken-vegtables-peanut-wok, have to say it was really good. You could also choose if u wanted it with beef, chicken or tofu with all dishes.The weakest thing was the asian inspired chairs that was kind of uncomfortable to sit at:)"
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,3/29/15,"Tasty and simple, but just missing that ""wow"" factor to make it a 5-star place. The service is quick and you will find all of the typical-of-Vietnamese-restaurants-in-this-city fare on the menu, plus a little more. The portions are decent. I got the yellow chicken curry and thought it was delicious, but just a little bit too salty. The Vietnamese coffee was nice and thick with a good amount of sweetness. The decor and prices are modest. It is pretty easy to reach with public transport, but I don't think I would go out of my way from another part of the city just to go here."
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,7/15/14,"Maybe the best meal we had in Berlin, very simple but a great Thai meal. Our host told us it's in the top 10 of best restaurants of Berlin. I'm not sure if she meant the top 10 of Thai restaurants, but it was great! We arrived pretty late around 21:00 (for Germany) but were still able to eat."
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,2/20/14,Nice small thai place. Food is good but not spectacular. Service and general attitude is great. Prices are reasonable. Go for massaman curry dishes if you dont like too spicey. No way you can fail. Ohh my ducks are so crunchy =)
Minh Quang,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,5/20/14,"Food is simple, yet tasty. Ordered the fried vegetables with chicken. Tom yan gung soup is a variation of the original thai recipe, but it was tasty. nice athmosphere and good prices."
Tak Kee,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,11/13/16,"While I think that this spot is very great for authentic Hong Kong food I must say that I was very disappointed by their vegetarian  menu.I was here with a friend from Hong Kong who likes Tak Kee a lot. She ordered one of the traditional clay pot rice bowls with chicken and I must admit it looked great! The chicken meat looked tender and the marinade smelled amazing. Actually their entire menu sounded amazing but sadly most dishes were mostly with meat or fish.On my question if it's possible to order one of these traditional clay pot bowl without the meat ingredients the waiter insisted that I should order one of their listed veggie dishes instead. Not sure if changing the dish is against their concept or not but it left me with a very limited choice of 4 semi interesting vegetarian dishes. I decided for veggies in a clay pot which didn't convince me in flavour nor concept. It was a boring food experience.It seems that authentic Hong Kong cuisine is simply not made for vegetarians since my friend had a hard time on naming 5 street food dishes that are meat free.However, I respect that and can highly recommend this spot for everyone eating meat. Its just that i won't come back since there is plenty of nicer options for me to eat in that corner of Berlin."
Tak Kee,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,7/26/16,"The food was decent however the service was absolutely horrible!! She was super unfriendly since she was only talking to other customers whilst we were sitting behind them with no menu given for 10 minutes."
Kin Dee,Thai,4,,5,12/6/17,"Thanks to Dalad and the entire staff for presenting one of the best meals of my life! Incredible night for us + our guests, everyone at Kin Dee was so accommodating and lovely, and the food was just B E Y O N D our wildest expectations. Spectacular presentation, the best + freshest ingredients for a more-than-reasonable price, and beautiful and lovely place to be. We CANNOT wait for our next visit!!"
Kin Dee,Thai,4,,2,8/9/17,"The food was average. Each dish was moderately flavorful, somewhat difficult to eat, and not presented with an applaudable aesthetic. The organization of the meal was also very poor: after each course, dirty plates were left in front of us for ten to fifteen minutes and frantically cleared immediately before the next course. The wine selection was good, however when I asked for a Malbec the waiter insisted on getting me the Bordeaux and there was no convincing him otherwise."
Kin Dee,Thai,4,,5,8/30/17,This place was incredibly tasty! I loved everything about it. From the aspect of sharing plates with your dinner companions to the complex yet simple thai flavours. Everything was superbly cooked. Had the beef curry and octopus which were both just amazing. Everything else was excellent as well. Chef greeted us at the end of her shift which was really nice too!
Kin Dee,Thai,4,,5,5/26/17,"Our favourite restaurant in Berlin. Real Thai served to share.  Fresh spicy flavours with local produce. Smart restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. Just select your main course (beef, chicken or fish) and chef sorts out the rest. A balanced meal progressively arrives."
Caf? Bistro Shaniu,Chinese,5,,5,1/15/18,"Stop the world: there's finally an authentic restaurant in Berlin that whips up a proper Chinese breakfast. While there's a bit of a markup because we aren't in New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles (read: hubs for good Chinese food), I think it's still worth stopping by this tiny little restaurant in Wilmersdorf over the weekend if you're craving some dim sum, baos, or youtiao. (It's conveniently located on four U-Bahn lines: the U1, U2, U3, and U9, so you don't really have much of an excuse.)Sadly, I wasn't able to order the xiao long bao because I no longer eat red meat -- what a time to live in Germany, right? -- but every other party in the room had at least one native Mandarin speaker who took the initiative to order xiao long bao for their tables. From my eavesdropping, they all seemed pretty pleased. I ordered a single youtiao (?1), a vegetable bun (?1.50), an order of four ha gow (?3.50), and a glass of hot homemade soy milk (?2.50).For those who aren't already familiar with Chinese cuisine, the menu lacks item descriptions and is a little barren. For example, the highlight of my meal was hands down the vegetable bao, but the menu only describes it as a ""steamed bun"" auf Deutsch. I don't think that does the savory combination of mushrooms, cabbage, and carrots justice. ?1.50 is also a very reasonable price, seeing as a bao goes for $1.50-2 in San Francisco. The ha gow was a little pricier and a bit smaller than what it would've been in San Francisco, but there was still a decent amount of shrimp inside and it tasted delicious, so no complaints!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/22/17,"Hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area that are willing to make the food as spicy as we would like it to be. The owner was quick to help us order the correct amount of spice and the woman cooking in the back was responsive to the spice level. Normally, Germans do not like much spice in their food. Rest assured if you ask for spicy food, you will get it. Really enjoyed the variety of food available. 4 different items, 3 drinks for 50? is a good meal. We will be back!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/11/17,"Best Chinese food I've ever had! No English menus but the waitress was beyond helpful. I actually ate here on my one night alone while my husband was at a work conference, and enjoyed every bite of my solo dining experience!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/1/17,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant by far. Their food is excellent - I have never had a dish I didn't like - and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you happen to be in the area around lunch time, try one of their soups (with fresh, homemade noodles!). The dishes can get quite spicy, but you can always ask beforehand if you're not sure."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/18/16,"This place is perfectly authentic! It's a small tidy restaurant, the dishes are so delicious and the price is reasonable. You can ask for recommendations and you won't be disappointed!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/17/16,"I haven't been to China, but this is what I picture as more of (from what I've seen on TV and from how friends describe it) as more authentic Chinese cuisine. Small place, very quaint but nice. My wife and brother in law had a chicken dish with green veggies (mostly onions and Lima beans, IIRC). It was very light in flavor, but in a good way. They both really liked it. I had a hot broth dish with some really great chili spices, beef, potatoes, and veggies. It had some real kick to it, but was pretty great. They served a family pot of white rice to eat everything with. Ended up being a little over ?10 per person I think. We will definitely be back here to try more dishes, strongly recommend."
Hoang Gia,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/11/16,"Nice and friendly staff.Fairly empty so it's a fast service and cheap prices, which makes it a hidden gem for food to go (there are also tables to eat in)."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,8/2/17,"This is the most authentic Chinese restaurant we've found in Germany. ?????????????????309 sichuan style chilli chicken is just so good, crispy and tasty. And the place is very easy to find. With nice decorations and light."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/19/17,Very nice place with great food. I said I wanna spicy so the waiter asked for extra spicy for me. Very thoughtful. If you are looking for a place that down to earth but has very good food. This is the best choice around the neighbourhood.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,12/29/15,"It indeed is a place that you can take a look if you really want some Chinese food in Berlin.But the service here is extremely bad. A fat short-hair ~30-year-old male waiter here is a living definition of how bad the service can be provided. He ignored requests of customers and he was lazy and bad-tempered. He looks like a king in the restaurant but he is actually a pig: he only smiled at young ladies and frowns at male customers.I wouldn't come back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,2/16/17,Very authentic Chinese Resturant. Try 309 (Sichuan-style Chilli Chicken).
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,7/1/17,"Below average service quality, food is ok. The waiter was rude; we were always ignored thus decided not to tip generously, he gave us the eye and complained rudely."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,1/18/17,"I've been to a number of Chinese restaurants in Berlin but this one is a real deal. I was so happy to find an authentic, yummy Sichuan Chinese place in this city. I read some people had problems with a rude male server there. My server was a female and she was friendly. Please don't get discouraged by a potential rude server. The food is worth a visit."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,1/24/17,"The best seafood soup I've ever had. Simple, yet so perfect. I don't remember the actual name but you can't miss it. The Shrimp is delicious! Really authentic. Definitely going back in a few days."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,12/29/15,"Honestly rating one star is overrating for tian-fu restaurant. Food, environment is ""ok"" in this place but overall not as good as the reviews. HOWEVER the service attitude towards to customers is ill-mannered especially the middle-aged waiter. The wait time was more than 30 minutes and this rude waiter said its normal to wait such a long time for dinning like its the customers problem.I also noticed that other customers came in without reservation were treated inpatient.I would not consider to have Asian food in this place any more."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,5/11/17,Who knew I would find one of my favorite Chinese restaurants ever in Berlin. And I don't even like Chinese food. Have spent a lot of time in China as well. Thanks guys.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,3/5/15,"I went here with some friends who highly recommended this restaurant. It is pretty authentic in Chinese cuisine but I didn't particularly love it. We ordered a bunch of dumplings and dim sum items. They were all pretty good, just not amazing in my opinion. I would try it again but definitely try some others out first before I go back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/12/16,"great chinese restaurant! With quite a nice selection of meals, not only the classic ones!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,1/25/16,"Word of the day is BANGING BUFFET. This place got a pretty good buffet if you ask me, take my word or dont you foolios. The staff and waiters are deaf and blind so dont expect anything from them. Its all about the food. Xie xie means thanks you in chinese so dont forget to use that one, it all ways works. Trust me. Peace"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,3/24/15,"As far as I know this is the only good Chinese restaurant in Berlin, and it's actually as good as anything I""ve had back in San Francisco, New York, or Houston.Once Berlin gets a decent cal-mex or tex-mex restaurant I'll never have to leave the city again for good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,10/22/15,Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin..  Try the spicy chicken (#309).  It's borderline too hot for me but the taste on the chicken and veggies is amazing.  We eat from here a couple times per month.  May need reservations for evenings.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,1/28/13,"By far the best restaurant for Sichuan food in Berlin! Couldn't find anything like this outside of China ;-)Top!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,11/28/13,"It gets five stars for being the most authentic northern Chinese cuisine I've had in Berlin (I used to live in Beijing); malheureusement the prices reflect that.Do you want ?????, ????,  ????????, ??.... ?? It's all here and it's all very, very tasty, ????, you won't regret it."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,2/11/15,Excellent chinese food! I can absolutely recommend this restaurant! Service is not too friendly but still polite. Unfortunately this restaurant does not accept credit cards.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,6/27/11,"I quite enjoyed this restaurant.  Unlike a few others in the street (on a Saturday afternoon), this one actually had clientele. I indulged in a number of vegetarian options - dim sum, aubergine, mixed veg, and a water spinach dish.  All good - the aubergine being the highlight.  Friendly service, quiet, and good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,5/24/11,"If you order a main course marked with 3 chilis in Tian-Fu, it really is uncompromisingly hot. Authentic Schezuan food, I must say. However, consistency seems to be an issue. Also the service of the male waiter was lacking."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,1/3/10,"So far, I found this place to be an adequate Sichuan restaurant. Atmosphere is nice, service is friendly and good, and the food is not too bad, although I haven't tried too many dishes. The good news is that the dimsum is actually homemade, the bad news is that it isn't that great but full marks for trying. The roast duck was passable, the fried rice was quite good and a couple of other dishes were tolerable. I will be back again as the hotpot looks quite interesting and so do some of the more traditional Sichuan dishes. The only comparable Sichuan restaurant in Berlin is the original Ming Dynasty in Br?ckenstra?e 6 and they are both pretty much neck-and-neck, though Ming is perhaps a little cheaper. Oh, the other good news is that I did not detect much use of monosodium glutamate in Tian Fu, so that is definitely a plus point. NOTE: I did come by again for the Sichuan hotpot and it was pretty good. Still, I think the Lucky Star in Friedrichstrasse does a slightly better hotpot with a tastier soup. Just my opinion!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,8/27/17,"One of my favorite Chinese place, fast service, staffs who can speak Chinese, English, German and Vietnamese.Nice food, price acceptable, nice location"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,8/14/17,"We have been visiting Good Friends for over ten years now and have never been disappointed by the service or the quality of the food.The restaurant can be quite overfilled on the weekend so to all the annoyed people out there: reserve yourself a table!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,6/28/17,"Went to Good Friends for lunch and ordered grilled pork, duck and stir fry Choi Sam. The service was good and efficient, unlike some other restaurants with arrogant attitude from the waitresses. Food was tasty though grilled pork is a little too salty. Definitely an authentic Chinese cuisine. Will come back again in the future"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,9/30/15,"I'm really happy that I could find a good Cantonese restaurant in Berlin,  So far I have tired many different kind of the Chinese cuisine, from different regions in China here. I always wondered if there is a one just for Cantonese. And then passed this place the other day, just couldn't help myself to give it a try. And it was just amazing, really tasted just like what I can have in my hometown. I ordered the most typical and delicious dish from here, the Cantonese roast duck.  It was really good, I enjoyed the meal a lot. Even my friends he wanted it so bad, the only reason he didn't pick it because of it got bones on it. But let's say he was a bit regret it, after he saw my dish. We also ordered some din sums,  the spring roll with shrimp was quite good, my personal favorite is the Har Gow (that is Cantonese, which means dumpling with shrimp). Just give it a try, you might love it. I went there with my partner and friends. At the end, we all enjoyed our food really much. The restaurant offers not only traditional Cantonese dishes, but also the westernize dished. So in this case, depend on the guest's mood, surely can find something on the menu. The restaurant is right next to the main street. It's really easy to find. Beside, you can have a peek of the roast duck from the window. Inside the restaurant has a really traditional Chinese style, how it decorated and how the tables set. It could be nice place to get to know some Chinese culture.  The waiters sort of remind me the waiters in Hong Kong, very efficient and don't talk much, but warm inside, if you need anything just ask. The price here is generally alright. When we were there, the restaurant was completely full, we were quite lucky , got a table without waiting. After a while we sat down, the waiting line start to appeared. And it was end until outside the restaurant. That is a good sign for the restaurant.  Just try to reserve a table, if you want to go. Otherwise it will really depend on luck and what time you are going. For me, no doubt, this is one of the great places for Cantonese cuisine in berlin. I will come here. Thumbs up!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,9/18/16,"One of my favorite restaurants in berlin. The food is really good and authentic. Good service and great atmosphere. Always a pleasure!!!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,2/26/17,"Good tradisonal chinese food, a bit stressome athmosphere. The service could be better..."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,3/3/17,"Visited for the second time today and food was really delicious. First visit went for sweet and sour chicken then on the second visit decided to try fried noodles with beef and I LOVED IT! Also, generous portions. Must try!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,5/18/15,"Had a family dinner at Good Friends just now. I was quite impressed by the food. Not bad at all. We are from Southeast Asia and has been traveling for alkost 1 month in Europe. We miss asian food and ""Good Friends"" is a good place to satisfied our taste bud"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,8/5/16,"Really good chinese food, try some fish dishes. Kind staff. A bit noisy and busy. They had TVs inside the restaurant for the Eurocup and I don't like football :("
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,1/7/16,"been there many times - and it is always a blast. We had the peking duck yesterday - which is a starter, actually. Even for me, the big eater: excellent."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,8/22/14,"I was here for dinner with two other companions earlier tonight. Since one of them wanted to try out a Chinese place here in Charlottenburg, we opted to start with this place. I placed a reservation earlier in the week, and when we arrived, sure enough, a table was waiting for us.We ordered several dishes, all to share. We ordered the dimsum platter, as well as a wantan soup for starters. After that, we also ordered the pork belly fried with snow peas, as well as the chicken fried with asparagus. I should say that I had better Chinese food somewhere else. Not that this place is bad; in fact, the number of people eating here are enormous, and so they must be doing something good. But I have to say that there are other places that have more spectacular food, and this place just ends up as being okay for me. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would also want to try other places as well.One tip: there is a difference between the orange part of the menu and the green part of the menu. The orange section is for Germans, while the green section is for those who want to try authentic Cantonese cooking. We only ordered from the green section of the menu, yet it still felt like I was eating Chinese food from the United States. Overall, not bad, but not stellar either."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,4/22/15,"I am probably biased, since I am not the best expert when it comes to asian food.The staff was formally friendly (which is a diplomatic form of saying, a bit stiff on the communication side of things). Yet they were pretty quick, and the food tasted fine.The pricing is more than fair, and the location is easy to reach with the public transportation system."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,4/6/16,Super yummy food and almost authentic like the food you may find in China.There are some pretty exotic cantonese dishes too.I was sitting close to the kitchen and was surprised to see the variety of the dishes they serve.and yes i was totally salivating!
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,5,5/9/16,Amazing! Nice dim sum. Great main dishes. Good desserts. This is the real Chinese food :) Everything falls perfectly
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,1/31/16,"Waiters are kind, but restaurant looks shabby and the food is the worst we've ever eaten. Nothing more to say."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,6/22/14,"After the bad experience at another Asian restaurant in Drsden called Good Friends, I'm going to try again with this Chinese restaurant called Good Friends...two times the charm!We ordered the seaweed tomato fish soup which was seasoned nicely, and the soup was very good. The roasted pork/duck/BBQ pork over Chinese cabbage was moist and juicy..just right. Mom got the beef chow fun noodles, and that was fine. I really liked the fried halibut with black bean sauce ( which was a mistake cause we ordered steamed, so we got the fried fish for free). The clay pot of tofu, cow stomach and vegetables were nicely seasoned. The steamed halibut in light soy sauce was well cooked but I kept getting a mouthful of bones. The shanghai bok choy as fresh and light.We did good here, I figured if there's enough local Chinese people in this place, then we won't go wrong like yesterday."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,8/9/14,"Not the best Chinese food in town in my opinion but it's always nice. The service truly is five stars. It's always easy to get a table."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,4/4/16,Best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Very big menu with regular and Cantonese offerings.  Large seating area but it is pretty busy so don't forget to call ahead.
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,11/30/13,"Many long-time Berliners have suggested this place, but to me it's just average greasy-spoon Chinese food--and expensive for what it is.It is popular though, and finding an open table is a challenge. There must, must be better in this city. I will endeavour to find it and post it here for you! Soon."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,4/16/13,"You must set expectations here not too high! The Interior is completely outdated, it is loud and crowded! The waiter quickly overloaded and in Stre? and forget ever order one or the other.The food was  partly  good, the fish is unfortunately not quite through. To order a second drink, you have to wait long.But even so I would have a second chance Good Friends."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/9/17,"OMG! Try their ""bulked up"" spring rolls. I'm sorry I don't know their actual name, but they're a more complex version of summer roll. Let me just say they are delicious?, and probably the best I've ever had. I also tried their spicy lemongrass soup which was excellent.On  side note, I drink Jasmine tea all the time, like everyday... unsweetened, nothing in it. Because I was travelling, I hadn't had a nice tea in a couple days, so I thought this was an opportune time. I have to say, that their Jasmine tea is if superb quality. Thank you for that Madami, it did not go unnoticed!"
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,12/15/17,"""Mom's kitchen.""Well then. Mom apparently has some pretty tough love. She's raised the prices of her dishes by 2 euros in the span of a year. Others in the area have stayed the same, so what gives? Surely Berlin isn't London YET, is it?I used to come here once per week for dinner- but Madami forgets customers like me in favor of tourists. Not much of a family at all actually. Not to mention, one of the waiters actually asked me why I came to the restaurant just to get a mango shake to-go. As if my business has a price minimum. I won't be returning."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,8/7/17,"Visited with the family today largely due to the large number of reviews on TripAdvisor. Everything started out ok, we each ordered a different soup as an appetizer and the soups were average but ok for the price. The problem was when the main course, #55 (the duck) which they recommended came and I noticed something didn't belong inside. Some kind of large German insect had found its way into our food. I called the waitress and she immediately apologized and took it off the table. I told her we wanted a new dish prepared. I watched as she took it back and they removed the insect with their fingers, cleaned it up and brought back the SAME dish!I told her what I saw and she apologized and took it back to the kitchen. The entire restaurant stopped eating as the kitchen staff and waitress began yelling at eachother and arguing. I told her we just wanted the pay and leave but she insisted on bringing another dish. At this point we were so disgusted we lost our appetite and wanted to leave. The owner came out and started arguing with us demanding payment and telling us they prepared a new dish (they did not). Long story short, the prices are cheap and the food is ok but eat at your own risk. If they handle food with insects and do not care about your health and cleanliness of the kitchen I would go elsewhere."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/28/16,"My husband and I had a wonderful lunch here!  The food was fresh, the flavours authentic and the prices very reasonable!!"
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,6/28/16,"Well, I was planning on going to a nearby location, but it was unfortunately closed for renovation. This was nearby, so I decided to stop in and try some Vietnamese food. My experience was very good, but a few things kept me from avoiding that coveted 5th star. Not wanting to overload myself, I ordered small plates, in other words entirely from the appetizer menu. Please forgive, the names might be a little off. Spicy lemongrass soup (tofu for protein), rice paper rolls (duck for protein), and pastry bags. Since I have reduced sensitivity to spiciness, I can't definitively say if the soup was spicy... But if it was, then very very mildly. The flavor of the broth was actually sweet and sour... Not sweet and sour like the sauce American Chinese restaurants give, but very sour with a good level of sweet. Don't let this deter you too much though, after a couple of spoons the ""shock"" from the sourness wears off. Ingredients in the soup were excellent, especially the tofu. However, I felt they were a little too large, especially for the porcelain spoon they provide. Rice paper rolls take the cake for this visit. They were absolutely amazing, as was the sauce that came with. The rice paper was soft, and held everything together superbly, but being rice paper it was very thin. As such, it did not overpower anything, not extra crunch or grease. Vegetables inside were fresh and crisp. Duck was cooked perfectly. I would have liked just a touch more protein, but... The balance of veggies to protein was not off in this dish, so I am not going to make a fuss out of it. Pastry bags were, unfortunately, the worse of the three dishes I ordered. I was expecting little baggies of thin dough, filled with awesomeness. No, this was a small teaspoon of ingredients sandwiched between two thick, slightly greasy layers of dough. I wish I could comment on the filling... But the dough overwhelming it too much. Service was quick and polite."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/30/16,"Ok seriously! how can they be in one of the most transited places in Berlin and be so good and so cheap?!We were there for lunch with 6 adults and 2 kids and everybody got a delicious meal and cleaned the plate as there is no tmw. I had the fried duck and had the chance to try the burger as well highly recommended. That was delicious! I also loved the smoothie with mango and coconut.The service is fast, friendly and it is possible to pay with card which apparently is not very common in Berlin. I was also pleasantly surprised by the kids menu which was a smaller portion of a normal dish. Bravo! I can't stand the fact that restaurants have only fries for kids as they are not also able to enjoy a normal dish. Funny fact! they are connected to the 2nd restaurant that they have around the corner through a back garden and yes! if you pay attention you will see someone jumping in or out through the window with some food in their hands ."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/12/17,"Came here for our last dinner before flying out of Berlin - what a find! Everything was excellent - from appetizers to dessert, the whole family was super impressed. We live in Seattle and have Vietnamese fairly often; this meal was up there with some of the best we've had (fresh, great sauces, lots of gluten free options for my wife, and an extensive menu). Highly recommended and would done here again."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/1/17,"We came here after long morning sightseeing of Berlin in November and trust me it was pretty cold so we needed something hot and comforting to feed ourselves with. We chose this restaurant as it is close to the television tower, just few min. away, tucked behind the station. It was pretty busy at the time, but thankfully we found a table for two. The food was excellent my friend had Pho and I had some tofu dish from daily offer menu. Both options were very tasty and well presented. I would say it was the best meal I had during our 2 days visit in Berlin. I have recommended this restaurant to my friends already and if I will visit Berlin in the future I will visit this restaurant again."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,4/2/17,"I don't like most vietnamese food. This place was an exception, where we visited twice in 3 days. The bao burgers are the boamb."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,2/17/16,"I found this place through Yelp and after seeing so many stars I decided to give it a try. The food was good. My Chicken Coconut curry rice and vegetables was really great with fresh flavors popping up everywhere. I also had the Pho Hanoi which did not have the same personality. There was nothing especial about it.I am a big fan of Mr Voug their very hype neighbor considered by ones as too hype to be true. I always have Pho there and I can say their Pho is especial and much better than the one at Madami.Mom's Vietnamese Kitchen is not bad at all but it is not amazing. It worth giving it a try."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,8/8/16,"Best Vietnamese restaurant that I have been to. It's a pity that it has to be in Berlin and not London. We came here a few times during our stay in Berlin. Every dishes were exceptionally good. The portions were large as well. The prices were reasonable, same as you would pay for a Vietnamese meal on Kingsland Road, but the food were 10x tastier. A must visit restaurant when you are in Berlin."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,11/9/15,"Cool place in Berlin (mitte) near all the shops and sbahn around the block from adidas.I think it's worth the trip. In Berlin it's quite difficult to find a decent meal, trust me I've been here (Berlin) a lot and there is a lot of food around just not great. This place is surely a win for me I had the crispy duck rice dish and it was good.The waiter is a lil slow - I have noticed that in these Viet run places the staff are always chatting and talking a bit too much among them selfs and need to remember that it's a Restaurant and that's it's rude. The waiter must be More attentive and not worry so much about the gossip going on in the kitchen.I would surly return but will need to make better eye contact to get them to pay attention to the customers."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,4/10/17,"Very good one in Berlin it was pleasure to have diner there.Wonderful food and very tasty."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,10/15/14,"I've been here for dinner once and I like it! As a super picky Vietnamese foodie I am very strict when it comes to Asian food but Madami nailed it.The interior is a good mix between minimalistic and chic - not too facy but not too shady either. I think it's cosy.I ordered stir fried glas noodles with tofu and my dish arrived after 12min! This is fast guys! The dish was all in all perfect. Super nice noodles in an awesome peanut sauce with juicy tofu. Gosh if I wasn't that full I'd ordered some dessert as well. I saw some vegan tofu dessert on the menu which I wanted to try but had to cancel that order since I was too stuffed. In short: Go there! Eat there! Be happy!"
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,9/26/16,"In a few words - the food is not good. If I had to come here again, I'd stick with the appetizers which are OK, and avoid the main dishes."""
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,4/20/16,"After my first not so good visit there (they were very busy at that time) I came to really like the place. I go there around 3 times per month for lunch. They always have sth tasty on the lunch menu, so it's never a problem getting a proper meal for good price (6-8 Euro). Lunch menu offer always comes with a small desert. You can also serve yourself complimentary ginger tea (near the counter). They have two shops very close to each other, so if there is no tables at one, just go around the corner and you find another 'Madami' (less than 1 minute walk)."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,8/13/17,"What's your restaurant nightmare? Mine is that I arrive hungry and looking forward to a nice meal. Then, first it takes 20 minutes before my order is taken. Then, guests who arrived 30 minutes after me are served their meals before I've even gotten a drink. Then, after being there 50 minutes, when I ask a waitress what's up, she says ""oops, order again."" This is what happened at this restaurant. I'd advise you to pass, but if you decide to risk it (the food and drinks did look tasty, though I can't speak from experience), don't be shy, speak up early and often and make sure that your order was actually submitted. Patrons within earshot of me also received the incorrect meal (meat when they ordered a veggie dish) while I was there."
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,10/10/16,I mean it was fine. The pho we had was tasty although we had some better ones (the one from Thaiwiese nails it!) although the level of spiciness was ideal! Sadly it can be difficult to get the staff attention when you need the menu or bill. For this price this should be better I guess.
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,4/9/16,"German flair to Vietnamese cooking. As you might expect the place is very clean. We ordered M3 off the menu which is soup/spring rolls/prawn for 2. Meal was served up kinda slow, taste was fresh and clean. Mango salad was salad with some mango in it. Half way through the meal a little cloud of flys over took our table? Is this a mark of the cleanliness of the kitchen?"
Madami - Mom?s vietnamese kitchen,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,12/12/16,"We had two different kinds of soup, pho with tofu and a spicy soup with pak choi and tofu and they were both amazing. The spring rolls with tofu were really good as well. The main courses didn't impress as much, we had bao burgers with beef (bland) and duck (good). For dessert I recommend the soy milk pudding with ginger sauce, if you like soy milk and prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, but the real winner here was the crunchy banana dessert - very tasty!"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/27/16,"I was looking for some nice place for nice buffet in Berlin, this one pop up. So I decided to pick weekend come here to have a try. The Royal Garden is a bit far from the city center. luckily, they are not so far from the S-Bahn station. It takes about 10 minutes to get to this place from the station on foot. For me, was 30 minutes around got to this place. My firest impression this place after I walked in. I really like how the restuarant looks like. It just got this very traditional and cultural of China in. the nice decoration just made the atmosphere of the whole place even better. It was very classy at the same time. The place was quite full when I was here, well, probably because it was weekend. That was the reason, I have called them before and made a reservation. It didn't take long, to find the table. And the staff come to us really fast. I did find it a bit funny that they only brought us one menu, when we gotlike 10 people. Anyway, we just came for the buffet, so it wasn't a big deal. I check thier cocktails menu and tried the drink. the price of the drinks were alright. the taste was of the cocktail Zombie I ordered was fine.About the buffet, they just looked amazing. one side was the food which already cooked and the other side was the food that not cook yet which people allowed that choose the way they wanted to be done. And the cold dishes like sushi and vergatables. They offered quite a lot options and good one. I found most of the food tasted great. I was so full after couple dishes. They also got an Icecream machine, which to be honest, I didn't really like the icecream. it just full of water and tasted just alright. I also didn't find watermelon at the fruit section. it was kind pity. At the end, I do think it is worth to come here to have a nice meal, even this place wasn't that close to city center. I think, for a big group of people will be a great choice, so everyone could find something they could eat."
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,4/25/16,"In a word - massive buffet, strange attitude, far away... But yummy.Longer version (for the brave) - I'll be honest, you'll never find me in this part of town unless there's a special occasion, and there was! A bday of a fellow yelper (and a friend) is a reason for a feast.I was first to arrive, and the staff looked at me and examined me constantly which made me feel uncomfortable, but when everybody else joined it was okay The place itself was crowded and every table was full, the minute somebody left, another group came almost instantly We ordered some cocktails and headed over to the Buffett, and that's exactly what I have in mind when I hear this word.Thing is massive! For 18? there's an endless option all you can Buffett - from simple salads to many grill options, you can make a mix grilled diy plate (choose from seafood, fish, beef, lamb, chicken and even kangaroo!)  or you can take some from the rodizio grill.And if that's not enough there are plenty of other main dishes- I've tried a little from almost everything, curry, different Chinese dishes, fried rice, regular rice, soups and deep fried fruits.Dessert? No worries! There's soft ice cream and various cakes to choose from! I wasn't expecting much from a place outside of town, but the quality of the food was very good! Everything I tried tasted fresh and there's a reason why I had four plates ;) If you are around and starving, I'd pass by"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,10/19/13,"My companion and I went here for dinner the other night. There was supposed to be another companion, but she canceled at the last minute. Anyway, the two of us went to the southern part of the city to check this place out. I heard good things, and I was willing to try something new.Anyway, I was surprised at this Chinese restaurant. It is huge. There is a huge statue at the door way. There is a floor aquarium with carp swimming. There is a chariot right at the middle of the room. It was all quite theatrical.Oh well, we weren't there for theatre, but we were there for the food. I was about to order something from the menu, but it seems that everyone here goes for the buffet. I am not typically a fan of buffets, wanting more quality than quantity, but when in Rome...So I went. I started with the soup. The soup was good. There were two choices, but I tried just the sour and spicy one. I also tried several dishes, and they even have a grill, where you pick up the meat you want, and put it on the counter for the person to grill it for you. It was all very elaborate. Anyway, the buffet costs 15,90 EUR plus drinks. Again, I rarely go to buffets, and I felt like a plump overfed pig afterwards. I have to say, the buffet choices were good. But with quantity, sometimes, it overshadows the quality. There are too many things to get your attention, which then makes it hard to determine whether what you ate really was special or not. I probably won't go to a buffet again for the next year, as this restaurant filled my buffet quota. Three stars, it was A-OK, but I'd rather go somewhere cheaper, and more special, and more intimate. While a buffet is a good way to sample what a restaurant offers, I'd go for quality over quantity any time."
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/6/16,"Perfect Asian buffet, the shrimps is to die for and so are the Mongolian bbq................................................................Strongly recommended"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,3/28/14,"Wild choices of yummy food from south east asia.With an open Wok grill, where you can choose your ingredients.The fairly priced open buffet, is ""balanced"" with rather expensive drinks.....The staff is super friendly, and the food quality is great....the location is in the middle of no where, and would make sense only if you have access to a car."
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,2/22/15,"Near where I live, but definitely not my favor. not original enough, more or less like german style chinese food; many people went there, buffet have a lot of Asian things. Stuff are nice."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,5/17/15,"We ordered the Pho with chicken and grilled chicken with peanut sauce. I don't think there is anything to say that can describe the taste. Nor can it be improved the curry was not thick but that's the way I like it... Uh huh uh huh uh huh...And the pho was just a tinge spicy, Started with an empty stomach... Left with a smile."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,6/27/17,"I have different feelings about our experience in this place. Technically the place is nice for eating outside because it's in the corner between the Kastainenalle and Oderb str, so, a very enjoyable spot. Inside then, it is simply amazing, you will spend some minutes looking at details and minimal asian decoration.Unfortunately our food was delivered cold and this is never acceptable. I got a duck with basmati rice and some ordinary sides. The taste was ok.Second thing, while eating outside a storm suddenly started and no one from the stuff asked/helped us to migrate inside. Bad.Apart from this I recommend it."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,7/29/17,It was my first time here. We looked at the menu outside and it looked tempting. It also had good vegetarian and vegan options. The good itself was ok to good. Staff was nice and welcoming and the updated terrace was nice and cozy.
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,4/14/15,"I went here for lunch earlier today. Since I was on my own, and had some time to burn, I went all the way to Prenzlauer Berg to try out this restaurant, as it has been on my list for quite some time and I haven't had an opportunity to try it out until today.They have a varied menu, and there seem to be plenty of options for vegan diners as well. I ordered the Bun Cha (rice noodles with fried pork neck in vinegar sauce) as well as a iced Vietnamese coffee.The bun cha was good, and very flavorful. The iced coffee was very potent. I have to say that given how many Vietnamese joints there are in this city, this place seems to excel. The dishes are well-crafted, and given what I have tasted today, I am more than willing to get back there and try their other offerings.The interior is small yet very cozy. If the weather permits, they have ample outside seating. Try it this summer while you can."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/2/15,"Good service, great food. Not sure how Vietnamese my main was (steak) but was still good. And yes, they have WIFI in case you're in need on your travels."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/12/14,"Brilliant.LOVE the decor! Super fresh food - lovely rice paper rolls with both raw tuna or salmon and lovely sauces to dip it in! Also love the bun cha and their shakes/drinks.Had a fabulous fresh watermelon shake! Simply superb :) Their nom du du is also great - I am a serious sucker for papaya salad, and this one is served with tender slices of beef.The best vietnamese I've had in Berlin so far!The waiters are really polite and nice too, and they all seem to be vietnamese. You can even get a sneak peak out into the kitchen, where the hard working men and women are cooking to satisfy your every need.They also have a lunch-offer consisting of a main dish and something to drink everyday for just around 7 euro - simply the best."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/14/15,"Went there for early dinner. Had a vegie roll and salmon with rice. They were excellent. As for drink, the typical vietnamese ice coffee is quite authentic n not too sweet."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,10/3/16,"Fresh, flavourful, creative Vietnamese food accompanied by superb service. I'm not as much of a fan of Vietnamese food as I am of Chinese, Korean, Japanese or Indian food; and most Asian restaurants in Berlin I find to be truly disappointing - but this is not one of them! They also have a good selection of vegan main dishes and appetisers. The prices are pretty fair for the location. The restaurant itself, is also lovely."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/10/14,"yummi-ya-yeah! I've stayed in prenzlberg for one week and went 4 times to van anh. fresh, tasty, healthy, friendly & yummy."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,7/29/14,"Nice, modern restaurant but slow service, bland tastes and boring menu. No vietnamese curries or pork available."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,10/7/14,"Tasty, fresh & cheap - what else can you ask for ? Was really surprised from the quality of the food regarding the price...nice."
Van Anh,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,8/14/14,"Great Place!Very nice, fresh food, good service, and lovely atmosphere.Thanks"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/11/17,Their noodles are honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavors are earthy and sophisticated and the food is super fresh and a lot is made daily like the noodles and broth. The food here has a great mix of textures and flavors that come together perfectly. Their desserts are super amazing too - not too sweet and also very aromatic. Seriously you will not be disappointed!
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,3/10/17,"This is an amazing place for fans of genuine Chinese (Sichuan) food. Taste and authenticity is the focal point here, and the staff's love for food shines through in all dishes. The ""Ahorn"" noodle dish is recommended!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/15/17,"Probably the best food all along the Brunnenstr. Had tried soups and noodles dishes, and they are all great. It's possible to discover up to 10 different flavors inside a simple baked potato. One of my favorites recently."
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/9/16,The noodles are spectacular. One of the best new additions to the Berlin food scene.
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/26/17,"Elegant, charming ambience. Cozy, intimate and full of beauty. The owners are super nice, make you feel right at home. And the food, oh the food is spectacular! I've been here four times already and it has been consistently good. Just the right balance of flavor, spice and home cooked goodness. Just delicious!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,12/8/16,"Peaceful ambience. Organic concept. The corner booth cubicals are an enriched idealism that in reality is quite uncomfortable; ambitious cross-leggers may suit these tables. Plating technique was beautiful but heavily lacked in flavor and depth. Service was very kind however, and as it is a new Restaurant it would surely evolve into something spectaular in the future."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,3/21/16,The food is exceptional and the service quick/friendly.   We ordered vegetarian food and left quite satisfied.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Be sure to get a reservation on peak nights as the restaurant is usually very busy.
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,11/29/17,"Originally wanted to try a Korean restaurant nearby but it was fully booked on a Saturday night so we settled for Chinese. The place was pretty full as well so we sat at the bar. We ordered dumpling in Sechuan sauce, steamed halibut and spicy beef stew and finished off with steamed rice balls and sesame ice cream as dessert. All dishes were pretty authentic and tasty but the streamed fish was the standout."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/16/16,"A place I could easily visit daily! The food is exceptional , the staff are more than friendly and talkative too! Happy to speak in English as well as German .  I feel extremely welcomed and more than satisfied when I leave . A massive thank you"
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,1/10/17,"One of the best places i have ever been to in berlin.Small and cozy place not something special but the food and the service were unforgettable. To be honest I haven't tried Korean food before and it was amazing culinary experience.I am really speechless about the food, really it was so authentic and special.The service was wonderful, a little Korean lady that would happy to explain about the dishes and also translate me everything to english.U must try the bibimbap with beef it was really tasty.I would definitely come back."
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,12/25/17,No frills Korean bibimbap. Authentic. Tasty. They pretty much just do bibimbap and one other dish. Seating is pretty tight so plan the do takeout.
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,7/14/17,"A place to go to!We were delighted to have a healthy fast snack based on a fresh salad with rice very quickly served and the waiter was very nice and friendly.It's a clean restaurant next to tourist places at a very good price and reasonable portions. So do not hesitate !"
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,2/12/17,"Very good, affordable bibimbap! A little off the beaten path but worth a visit. We got the Bibi Mami--the smaller portion, and it was just enough food. Pro trip: the drinks they serve here are very good and also unusual. My aloe vera green tea was tasty and just sweet enough. My friend got the ginger lemon (beer? Don't remember exactly what drink) and it was DELICIOUS. A little on the expensive side, but worth the splurge to try it.The service was fine. The food was out quickly and they spoke enough English to deal with us. There are only three tables inside, but I saw several people come in and pick up takeout. Pay this place a visit!"
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,7/18/17,"This place has tasty, authentic Korean food at a reasonable price in a nice area. I definitely recommend this spot to Korean lovers and people looking to embrace a new cuisine. The atmosphere feels fresh and bright, and they have pleasant outdoor seating."
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,2/27/17,"This is a great deli-style Korean place. They're affordable, friendly, quick and you can usually always get a seat. Coming from Los Angeles with tasty treats galore, I highly recommend this restaurant. :)"
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,7/15/15,"In a word - nice fusion takeoff on kimchi.Fair price but rather small dish, good if you're not too hungry.Longer version (for the brave) - we arrived here during a power break so they only had bibimbap.. Which was great because that's exactly what we wanted!We didn't wait for too long as we were pretty much the only ones - I've had a tofu bibi that had an unusual choice of veggies like lettuce and cucumbers, it was more like a bibimbap salad more than the actual traditional dish, but there was rice at the bottom of course.Everything was really fresh but of course I had to take some of the veggies out as I don't like all of them, so I've been left with a 3/4 of a dish, that still filled me up quite alright. We also shared a canned of ginger beer that was filled with sugar and super tasty! Overall- a nice place with simple food and good service."
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,9/27/15,"I really like this place - their Tuna bibimbap tastes much like the kinds I had in the Korean restaurants. This is the closest to a dish (if you know Korean food) called Hwe Dup Bap that I could find in Berlin. Also, their kimchi was AMAZING and spiced properly (hot!). This plus their ginseng tea is totally perfect for a cold winter day. They also have Korean style Fried Chicken, similar to ""Bonchon Chicken"" chain you'll find in the US.  It's delicious!!"
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,8/12/15,"I like here lot. Its not typical korean traditional bibimbap but very tasty and fresh. Unfortunately sometime need to wait long for dishes but please take it easy. Warm greeting and good service might make you bit more comfortable."
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,8/27/15,Excellent Korean food with relatively quick service very close from Alexander Platz. I recommend their beef bibimbap (?7.5).
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,6/8/16,I like the spicy burger and the bibimbap here.The service is little slow and the place is rather small.The variety is small but everything tastes fresh and almost homemade..
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,3,4/12/16,"Well, as an Asian who knows what an authentic Korean taste is, their food is ok, but definitely not what I was expecting. The place is clean, the Korean girls are nice and friendly; just the food couldn't please me -- way to sweet!! Get a good Korean chilli sauce from Asian market and try it out."
Bibi Mix,Korean,4,Under ?10,4,2/19/16,"I had the tofu bibimbap which was fresh and really tasty. I loved the way they gave you lots of veggies in the bowl - rocket, cucumber, courgette, cabbage etc. The space is light and the staff were really friendly. Can't wait to go back and try the tofu burger and the kimchi!"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,8/22/17,"Not as spicy as the papaya Charlottenburg Kantstra?e, but the same great fresh foods. To me Papaya is definitely one of the best thais in Berlin"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,2/25/17,"Spicy chilies, fresh ingredients and good portion size. Enjoyed the fresh rolls with peanut sauce, chicken pad prik, beef pad kee mau and washed it down with a green tea milk shake. Service was standard."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,3,4/1/15,"My boyfriend and I wandered up around lunch time after hearing nothing but good things. We're kind of on the look out for the best Thai food in the city, so my strategy is to always order the same thing: fruhlingsrolle to start, and gaeng massaman for the main. First of all, the menu was huge. If you like having a lot of choice you'll be happy here. Sadly I couldn't find the massaman on the menu (to be honest it's probably on there, I was just too hungry to concentrate) so I went for one of the house specials instead: Papaya Ente. The spring rolls were pretty standard, although I think maybe the frying oil needs changed as they tasted every so slightly funky. Still, all manner of sins can be forgiven when sweet chilli dipping sauce is involved. They may not have been the best spring rolls I've eaten in Berlin but they were pretty good, and I munched the lot- even the salad garnish.Sadly I didn't have the same enthusiasm for my main course. The sauce was pretty bland first of all (it just tasted of soy). Maybe I could have livened it up with the various chilli sauces on the table, but I didn't. The ratio of veggies to meat was all wrong too: unless you're trying to get more veg into your diet, then it was probably all good. I really don't like vegetables in gravy, the soggy texture puts me off completely. I'd eaten enough salad with my starter so unfortunately my plate still looked full when the waitress came to collect it: even though I'd eaten all the duck and the rice.All in all Papaya is a solid three star place. You could seriously do a lot worse in this part of town, but likewise you could also do better. As long as you're not expecting to be blown away, it's a solid choice for a sit-in meal."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/5/15,"Great restaurant and very nice dishes! If you like your meal a little spiced-up this is defenitely a place where thats possible..Already have been here three times in the past month, definitely one of my favorites :) !"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,9/29/16,"In a city where poor customer service and careless, dirty food is everywhere, Papaya is a haven. Proper tasty Thai food, GREAT service and the little signs of respect for the industry - the Menus are properly made, designed and always clean, your beer always come with a matching CLEAN glass and so on. Definitely recommended!!"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/12/14,"Absolutely love Papaya. The service is always super quick and friendly and they have English menus in addition to their German menus. Sitting outside in the summer is always a treat waiting for your food and drinking their house red wine (which is fairly priced and pretty good).The best vegan option at this location would be #48 Pet Pad Tao Hu which is a variety of deliciously cooked vegetables and tofu served in a red curry sauce with rice on the side. I always add the extra red chili sauce they serve on the table."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,2,8/4/14,"Predisclosure: I am absolutely obsessed with papaya salad.  So with a name like Papaya, I thought for sure I would have to love their papaya salad.  Unfortunately no papaya love today.I ordered a small tom yam gung and som tam.  Soup didn't taste very seafoody (shrimpy?), wasn't particularly spicy, sour, or even lemongrassy.  If there was at least some boldness from any one of those elements, I would have been more pleased.  Similarly the papaya salad wasn't too remarkable either, which made me sad.  In their defense, I didn't ask for the food to be spicy because I wanted to be able to taste everything, but I think I was simultaneously hoping that they would at least take into consideration that I'm Asian and would make it a tad bit spicier for me than for the regular German palate.  This is completely not their fault and I am in no way deducting any stars from them for lacking spicy character.My boyfriend ordered a red chicken coconut curry, which was good, but I haven't been to a single Thai place that screwed up a curry dish, so no extra bonus points there.Where they really lost me was the service.  It took them a while to bring our drinks.  And it took them a long while to bring our check from the first time we asked.  Since I was seated facing the room, I kept on giving the ladies the signal that we were ready to go.  We ended up asking for the check again.  Then we waited some more.  Once I was finally ready to just go up and pay, we got our bill.  The place was busy, don't you want to get the people who are ready to go out the door as soon as possible?  Guess not.  Or is this a cultural thing?Food was okay, flavors were subpar for the 2 dishes I ordered, and service was subpar.  Since I've only been there once, I can't say this one experience is the standard for this place, but based on this one time, I'm not hunkering to go back any time soon."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,1,10/30/15,Keep you waiting and then come later to confirm your order. Takes a lot of time to serve food. Not enough waiters . Poor customer service. Food overall is average - nothing too special. There are plenty of other places with the same quality of food though with a lot better customer service
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,5/1/15,I love this place. Been to several Thai places in the area and this must be my favourite. The tom kha gai soup is super tasty as well as their glass noodle dishes. The staff is friendly and food is served quickly.
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,3,6/16/14,"As we felt like changing from our usual Thai place I asked my friend for a new cool place to have lunch, so me and two friends sat down outside, service is really quick, we ordered three different dishes and shared them all.We had chicken with vegetables in red curry, fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce and chicken with vegetables in a sauce I have no idea what it was l but was a bit tastelessWe could barely finish as the dishes are quite big, even though I think they shouldn't charge what they do for it, the flavors were good and they have a variety of peppers to spice it all up, I love it. I just do. The rice noodles had a bit of an after taste but the rice is great, so I recommend it. It's not mind blowing, but another place to have lunch, thing is - we all experienced some sort of nausea after it, but as we are all three dishes together I can't point out on what dish made up feel that way"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,2/21/15,"Went here around the typical Berlin dinner hour (9pm), mostly because all the other places were closed and we were actually able to get a seat here on a Friday night.  My expectations were kind of low at first; going into a restaurant without having done my research beforehand always warrants such a level of expectation.  My initial impression after going is was that they may have invested all their efforts into the atmosphere instead of the food (I'm a bit skeptical of Berlin Asian food if you can't tell).  But I was really pleasantly surprised with how spicy, flavorful, and fresh the food was!  I ordered Pad Kee Mau and asked for it extra spicy.  They delivered and it was really freaking hot!  Very delicious as well, everything was super fresh and expertly cooked, and the service rocked.  The value for the money was a bit above average for the area, as the food was higher quality than expected.  Our original destination was Lemon Leaf that night, but I will have to decide between the two as to which is the better one."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,9/10/15,Who knew that you'd find good Thai cuisine on the other side of the globe. This place was so good we ended up dining here twice during our four day visit.
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,1,4/5/12,"I read all the good reviews on qype and wanted to try Papaya. I also liked that they use organic meats. Unfortunately, my food was a disappointment. It was only stir fried veggies with shrimp but the veggies were clearly precooked and set in the fridge to later be warmed. One large piece of broccolli was not thoroughly warmed up again so I bit into a half warm half cold piece of vegetablenasty! What precook the vegetables when they can be stir fried from raw so quickly??? Unfortunately the mushrooms were nearly raw but all the other veggies were soft and mushy. I hate that in a stir fry. At least I could taste that the y were not frozen vegetables but still the food was not fresh. My boyfriend had a coconut curry that was bland and super watery. The food is not cheap which made me feel even more strongly about writing this review. I would not eat at Papaya again."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/3/09,"Look I'm thai and I typically do not eat at other thai restaurants. However, I've broken that pact for a select few restaurants. I have to say- I like Papaya. However, I should tell you what I get, so you don't go applying my words to everything and anything. Although they have an extensive menu and two restaurants on the same freaking street, I choose to the go the smaller one closer to Simon-Dach. It's less crowded. My husband and I have our preferences for thai food, so the stuff we don't get too often, stuff we don't cook, or stuff my parents didn't make are the stuff we order and eat. with that being said, I'm very much into noodles and noodle soups. He gets the stir-fried types, pad woon sen . . I get wonton soups or noodle soups. Thai people are my favorite people for noodles. I know Pho food is noodle heavy, but it's often bland and requires you reaching for table condiments. The wonton soup has another name which I don't know. But it was fresh and delicious and surprisingly filling. Wash it down with Lychee or Mango lassi / shake (Nahm Puhn) and you've got yourself a typical meal for me. The papaya salad is also delicious, which of course is always an indicator of great thai food. The neighborhood is great, so that's one more reason to draw you there. I love my hood and you should too!"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,5/22/11,"the food is really good and the portion sizes are in order. prices are a bit expensive. however, i recommend the place if you're up for some thai food."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,10/21/08,"we LOVE papaya!! the food is always fresh, fast and tasty and the staff are super friendly. we eat their at least twice a week and are always happy with it. if you want great thai, go to papaya!"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,3,6/22/08,"i've been here a few times and i don't feel the dishes justify the price. usually i go here when there are guests in town, so i have sampled a lot of the dishes since i'm usually there with large groups of people. the ingredients are quite fresh, however the taste is still quite on the bland side and the spice level close to nonexistant. this would probably be a better restaurant if they didn't tone down their recipes for germans, but then again they would probably not survive. thai food in general is lackluster here in berlin, so if i'm going to have something bland then i'd rather get it for less elsewhere."
Cay Tre Quan,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,4/11/16,"Great food! Did not expect it to be that good! Price is fair. I payed 3,50 for a starter and 6,50 for the main course. It was a bit empty in the restaurant when I went in, but still definitely a recommendation! Amount is a bit more than average I'd say. Cons: Cash only and the waitress is not very fluent in German or English. But no big deal."
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,5,10/8/17,"Omg, you must try this. Very very expensive but you will never eat so well. You won't feel bloated after many courses, and the beer and drinks are superb. Please try this, the shrimp is unreal and the lamb can't be explained you must try it."
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,1,11/15/17,"Pretenious restaurant with over priced dishes and ridiculously tiny portions of food. Scam and rip off. 60 Euros for three mains, one rice and one beer bottle..you'd expect to be not hungry afterwards but far from it in this case. My dish which was the beef salad had 50 grams of meat and 5 leafs of pak choi. Looked like it was an appetizer more than anything, was even small for an appetizer!! All three mains were the same size!! We were all hungry and extremely disappointed and shocker by what had happened.We will never come here again!"
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,1,9/19/17,"Scam - so small portions, you should avoid.They sold us 2 apps priced at 16 and 17 euros each We were 3 peopleWe took 2.25 pieces of sushi each That's 30 euros30 euro wineAnd 5 waterSomehow we paid 70 euros to be able to go out of the restaurant.The 19 euro 3 piece lamb dish arrived and I started revolting and didn't want to see the rest of the value, asked for the bill, complained about the sizes. The waiters agreed that the sizes are ridiculous and that they had warned the owner but that he doesn't listen.All pictures are close ups. You might want to go to Kebab shop down the street after leaving this place starving having paid 100 euros!It's such a rip off don't hate yourself and just avoid the place."
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,5,5/18/17,"Last night out in Berlin and we couldn't have found a better place to have a nice meal.After a long day visiting this vibrant city, we found ourselves looking for a restaurant that would still serve food at 10.30PM. My two colleagues and I were ready to end up in a kebab in a shady neighbourhood but luckily enough, we stumble upon a fancy thai restaurant. We weren't sure if it was and asian fusion cuisine of some sort but at that point, we were just hungry!I can't say much about the decor because we ate outside but from the window, the interior looked classy with a hint of Asia. What I liked the most about what was going on inside is we could see the cooks' kitchen from our table. The transparence of the food preparation opened up my appetite! The staff were really nice and welcoming. Despite de fact that their kitchen was going to close in 10 min, they still accepted to serve us, without any sense of annoyance. The waitress greeted us with warm hand towels and really took the time to explain the menu. She gave us time to order, coming back twice because I had to translate the menu to my colleagues.The food was A-MAZING ! I ordered the Krapao Corn Soup as a starter and I knew for the moment I tasted the blend of spices that this was seriously going to be a culinary experience. The texture, the perfume and the richness of flavours was such a delight at each spoonful. When I saw my main dish(Massaman Mai), I didn't know where to start because it looked like a piece of art so I just tasted each composant separately (which was a delight to start with) and combining everything was mind-blowing !  I have never tasted anything like this in Asian cuisine before and this fortuit discovery was the cherry on top of our Berlin trip. If you're ever around the Mitte neighbourhood with an open-mind and an empty stomach, this is the place for you !"
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,1,11/15/17,Slow service; and no coordination between the staff for the price you pay. Waited 40 mins for 2 mains but only 1 main arrived and they forgot about the other one. Would not recommend this place.
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,5,6/13/17,"Great twist on Thai food. Everything we tasted was great and so was the service. Go for the papaya salad, and the corn soup, you won't be disappointed."
Nithan Thai,Thai,3.5,Above ?41,4,2/17/17,It isnt a traditional restaurant. If you thinking you'll be eating Thai food you're mistaken. Whats thai about it is the ingredients. I loved the food specially the pepper beef which was very full of taste. Same time we ate the thai beef which was great also but the pepper beef taste was so strong that the taste of the thai beef almost disappears. Tip is not to eat both in the same time.
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,5,4/16/15,"My favorite restaurant in Berlin :) Authentic Korean flavors thanks to the amazing chef and his talent! Warm recommendation to everyone who appreciate quality, hospitality and off course Korean food."
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/24/17,"definetely best korean bbq in berlin! don't be fooled by it not looking so ""hip"" like the other korean bbqs in berlin. simple decoration but the best food and awesome service."
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,1,4/11/16,"I am so shaken by what happened it took me some time to write this. It was myself and my boyfriend on a Sunday evening, very happy after a beautiful day, and excited to eat Korean food. It was not busy. There were only two other groups in the restaurant. The menu was confusing but we were very polite to our server and tried to understand how to order. We tried to order two table cooking - one for each of us. The server told us he ""didn't have time for us"" and walked away. We were confused by this but were in such great spirits we continued to sit, hoping he would return in a more pleasant state so we could order. After 10 minutes of waiting he came back to tell us that he would not be serving us and to leave the restaurant. We could not believe it, or understand why, and were so shocked at having been treated so aggressively and disrespectfully."
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,5,11/29/14,This place serves real nice Korean food: Korean hotpots and sizzling dishes. Service is extremely friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. Would really return here.
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,3,7/30/15,"I don't know why there are 5 star reviews for this place.  Firstly, I don't know why the kimchi was so salty but I couldn't continue eating it.  The waiter suggested something from the menu which we agreed to, he then bought something different out & when we queried it he argued with us telling us that we ordered the all-you-can-eat displayed in the window.  How could we order this, we couldn't even see that window from where we sat?  If we had ordered this all you can eat then it explains why they were like vampires before garlic when trying to get their attention.  Anyway lost in translation maybe but I didn't appreciate him arguing back, especially since we ordered what he suggested and he even pointed at the menu to confirm what we ordered.  We were also the only people in there.Food was ok, not the best Korean I've had but not the worst either.  I'll look at other places before considering to return here"
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,3,7/1/15,"Its ok but menu is very confusing and drinks are expensive and not special. Lately food is noot as good as before, especially beilage."
Su Korean BBQ,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/17/15,Best Bibimbap I've had in Berlin. The decor is rather simple/minimal but the food simply delicious and the waitress very friendly and sweet.
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,9/22/17,"Great, friendly service. Great recommendations. Vegan and vegetarian variations. Tasty !"
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,8/22/17,"After almost a week in Berlin, I was craving some Asian food and my friend recommended Miss Saigon. Coming from Philadelphia, which has one of the largest Vietnamese populations on the east coast, I was a bit hesitant to try Vietnamese on foreign soil, but ended up really enjoying my meal.First off, the menu was quite different from what I'm used to - there was a much more varied selection of pho (with some tomato- and seafood-based broths as well as the more commonly seen beef- and chicken-based broths), and there were no broken rice dishes. We split an order of the beef summer rolls, which were good but not outstanding. For my main, I ordered a baked fish, which was awesome. It was tender, flaky, and well-spiced, served atop rice and accompanied by a refreshing salad of lettuce, cilantro, and mint garnished with crushed peanuts. My friend ordered one of the pho dishes and really enjoyed it as well. He also clued me into his favorite item on the menu, the avocado shake. It is served in a pretty small glass and disappears all-too-quickly, but is super delicious!Our meal came out to ?26 total, a reasonable price for the generous portions of delicious food. It did take us a bit of effort to place our orders and to get the check, but all in all service was friendly, it was an enjoyable evening, and I was glad to have the chance to try a Vietnamese dish that I'd never seen before."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,1,1/6/18,"It was so disappointing that we left after the starters. Beef was tasteless and dry, all the sauces are very similar and almost without spices. We reserved and had to wait for ten more minutes before our seats were free. The prosecco was over... The dumplings tasted just like gum."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,12/29/16,If you are looking for an American tasting pho.. this is not the place. The reason being is that heir hoisin sauce isn't the Hoisin brand used in the states. It makes the entire broth taste weird and I was really disappointed with the overall quality of the food.
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,5/30/17,"Lovely place, absolutely delicious food at a very reasonable price. I got an appetiser, main and a coffee for under ?10. The lady who served us was super lovely. Very impressed. Would rerun in a heartbeat."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,5/26/17,"This is one of those small amazing and intimate dining cafes. The quantities are pretty huge and are generally okay for one person, but I felt that my soup could be easily finished by sharing with another person ( that huge a quantity). Go for the chicken dumpling soup, it's plain and simple and yet so full of flavours."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,1,1/13/17,"What a disappointment.Came in with high expectations due to other reviews, but this was the worst vietnamese - or any type of food - my friend and I have tasted!!For the  high price of 7.50 that we paid, we were served up a bowl of overcooked noodles with a few pieces of strange seitan and a goopy, sugary sauce that could have come out of a McDonald's packet. Really wanted to like this place, but never again. :("
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,7/13/17,"My review is only for their pho and, for context, I'm used to the pho in the San Francisco Bay Area. I thought the broth was tasty and generally up to par with good pho. They didn't have pho dac biet or anything with too much meat variety (no tendon, flank, etc) but, again, the broth was good and the rest of the ingredients seemed fresh and well prepared/cooked. My friend ordered the banh canh and didn't like it at all though lol."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,5/31/17,"Very average food for the price, my friend got a fried rice tofu main and I got a vege spring roll bowl with vermicelli, each for 6-7 euros, which was comparatively much too expensive when you look at other greater, cheaper places in the area. Service was bad: the lady was avoiding my gaze when we were trying to get the check, which was downright rude."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,11/9/16,"Awesome food and reasonable prices. The pho is great for a cold day. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options as well! I ordered the lemongrass tofu dish and it was really flavorful and delicious. You even get a small soup beforehand that was warm and tasty. Huge beers for a cheap price as well. I recommend making a reservation as it can get packed! You can even sit outside during the fall/winter because there are heat lamps."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,6/28/16,"This was to be the last meal in this town and I knew it had to be Vietnamese. I have walked passed this place once before; the patio dining on the cobblestone street, laid back atmosphere and the hippie crowd really drew me in.One glance at the menu and familiarity is there but yet still so foreign -- like many of the Vietnamese meals I've had here. There are just so many items that intrigue me and the thought that I can't try them all is absolutely killing me.My love had the dumpling soup and it was divine. Delicately made in a delicious broth with fresh fillings. This stuff tastes absolutely fresh like it was just wrapped the moment you've ordered it. I had the Pho and it too tastes extremely fresh and well prepared. To finish things off we went with the banana leaf sticky rice dessert which is sinfully good and a strawberry smoothie.It's true they say you do get what you pay for. It's difficult getting accustomed to paying a premium for Vietnamese food here as opposed to back home however with this you do get considerable quality. Highly recommended."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,4/27/16,"Fresh and yummy Vietnamese cuisine. The service is very nice. Each dish comes with a small plate of herbs and sprouts that you can add to your meal. This place is very busy, I recommend making a reservation. Will be back ;)"
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,8/24/13,"My companion took me here for lunch one day. We haven't seen each other for a while, and decided to catch up while having lunch, and since this was close by, we decided to try it out. One thing I immediately liked was the fact that they have Bun Bao. I miss these small steamed rice cakes filled with meat inside; it reminds me of the Siopao I typically eat in Manila. Each cake costs around 3,50 EUR and it is steamed to perfection.I also ordered the No. 1 Soup; at least that's what the menu claims it to be, the number one soup in southern Vietnam. I liked the fact that there were plenty of things inside, mostly seafood but there were also ""interesting"" contents, like liver and quail egg. That being said, the flavor was not too strong, and I wished there was soy sauce or sriracha on the table to enhance it. So, I am giving this place 4 stars: 3 for the soup, 5 for the bun bao. The service can be a little slow, but this is Berlin, and that is typical."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,6/19/15,"Very Good Pho Bo.(but does not active the perfection of Pho 13, Paris, France)Fresh Goodies.Quality Meat.Definitively recommend."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,9/21/16,"THANK YOU MISS SAIGON! So thankful to have discovered one of the few payable asians that peek out of the mass. Great place for vegans as they offer incredibly good saitan dishes. A lot of fresh herbs and spices, absolutely delicious. Dishes are very unusual compared to standart Berlin offer, so it's a place for the curious who like to discover new things."

Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,9/15/15,"Absolutely delicious vegan meals. For 6,70? you get a small yummy veggie soup + a main course. I got vegan dumplings on ricenoodles, salats and sprouts. The dumplings were amazing!!I also got the saigon cocktail which I totally enjoyed.Keeping this place in mind for when I return to Berlin."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,4/22/16,"Read all the positive reviews and decided to check it out, since I also work not far from the joint. It's not bad but nothing to rave about either. In my opinion it's just standard vietnamese food in Germany... somewhere to grab a quick lunch."
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,8/1/16,"Great restaurant.Good food,  low prices.We had a great diner.It is always busy so you must not be in a hurry"
Miss Saigon,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,9/27/15,"This place serves vietnamese food that isn't the same as what seems to be served at every other vietnamese restaurant in this city.Here, you'll be able to find daily specials and rice/noodle dishes that taste great and put a smile on your face."
China Restaurant Ming?s Garden,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,8/4/11,"Been there twice for lunch already and it's really not bad at all for a Chinese in Berlin. Both times I had the business lunch deal at EUR6 to EUR7.50 where you get a small soup (hot sour or veggie) or a springroll, and then a rather big choice of mains. It's a really good deal. I've had the roast pork with a spicy sauce (not spicy at all but maybe for a German), which was the traditional Chinese red porc in a sweet soya sauce and then some really yummy fried rice (at everything in it), which I find really hard to get here. Today, I ate the veal in a Chinese curry sauce and that tasted pretty authentic too. If you want to go for dinner the ? la carte menu is varied but not too much (meaning that the food is fresh) and they have a fairly good selection of wines. The decor is extremely 70s Kung Fu movie."
China Restaurant Ming?s Garden,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,3,7/11/17,"I walked up to the counter and asked where I should sit. I was told anywhere. I chose a table outside it the public area but just outside the restaurant. It is their area as well. It took a very long time get my order taken. The wonton soup was good. It is broth, mushrooms, green onion, and wontons. I ordered the Kong Pow Chicken and the double fried pork with sweet and sour sauce. It came with white rice. All the food had a good toast. Not the best but not the worst. The service really hurt their score. I almost walked out waiting. The value is good for the money."
China Restaurant Ming?s Garden,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,4/25/11,"I think we must have picked the wrong time of day to visit this restaurant. We went quite late at night and it was busy but the food was nothing like the reviewer's on qype raved about nor like the pictures.The restaurant is quite out dated and looks like it needs a make over but i hoped that the food would be at least worth it which I'm afraid for the price it was a big let down. Bf ordered king crab cocktail which was ?10 to which the waiter said they had none but could make it with prawns for him so we thought he would deduct the price a bit since it wasn't what he originally wanted. When the bill came they had charged the full ?10 and it was a tiny amount he got. They also served his starter before mine so i had to wait 10mins wondering if mine was going to arrive.Main courses were ok but nothing special and if anything they were far too salty. The portion sizes were huge though and can't complain about that but definitely share one as we couldn't finish ours. The main complaint for us was the final price ?50 it was just not worth that for what we got and the waiters made no interaction with us apart from asking what we wanted to order. Felt like we were ripped off. So we won't head back there when in Berlin again."
China Restaurant Ming?s Garden,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,2,7/14/12,"I must admit I am generally not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but when my friend had a Chinese friend in town, I figured I'd go. Even though the whole ""it's proper Chinese"" is more scary than exciting to me (I lived in San Francisco and have had proper Chinese food). Luckly, the majority of what they offer is ""western"" meat, mainly pork. The dim sum menu is good, but I think too small and they serve all the dishes at once rather than after another, so some get cold - not so yummy. But all in all I thought the dishes were bland and lacked flavor (but I often think that of Chinese food) and for me there is always too much sauce. The Chinese freind was also not too impressed. I am sure there are better Chinese places in Berlin."
China Restaurant Ming?s Garden,Chinese,3.5,?11-20,4,11/18/07,"Ming's Garden is really located in the Marburger Stra?e and is in easy walking distance to the KaDeWe. This restaurant is chinese by heart! You never have the impression that some of the interior is a fake. The restaurant is lovingly decorated. The dishes were all good and well prepared. Someone who likes it really hot wouldn't choose a chinese restaurant anyway. ;-) The waiters are confirming the ""preconception"" of chinese friendlyness. :-) With regard to price Ming's Garden is slightly above the average. But the good quality of the meals justifies this!"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,4,10/30/17,"Considering that most Thai food places we have tried in Berlin so far were somewhat disappointing, we were really surprised to find Thai Inside. Pricy, as it is in one of the ""can't miss if a tourist"" areas of Berlin, but very fresh and tasty. Also the vegetarian options are truly vegetarian (no fish sauce!) and don't lack in flavor, as is so often the case if a typical flavor carrier (such as fish sauce) has to be replaced.I can recommend this restaurant, staff was friendly and on top of things!"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,1,12/2/17,"Unbelievable, Apparently closes at midnight but the kitchen was closed at ten.  Many tables were open at the restaurant but the reason given was the kitchen is full.I don't mind if that's the policy but be transparent so when customers plan their dinner they aren't left disappointed at your door.Sadly I can't comment on the food and any of the dining experience.Get there early and hope the policy hasn't changed"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,7/29/17,"A bit pricy for the taste. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and served beautifully, but taste is average, so IMO it is not worth more than 3.5 stars (rounding down to 3)"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,8/21/17,"The food was ok but not particularly delicious. Also, I found the meals (outside of the menu) overpriced (around 20 euros each)."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,5,10/12/16,"While visiting Berlin last week we heard about this place on TripAdvisor and it was close to our hotel as well. It did not disappoint! While somewhat pricey the quality and presentation made it worth it. The standouts were the duck, the mango sticky rice and the fried banana but everything was delicious! Service was attentive as well."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,5,8/8/16,"Excellent food, service and ambience. I had no idea what I was ordering ( either a separate menu in English or someone who can explain what different dishes are would be really helpful). But, I ended up just choosing something with chicken and had a wonderful chicken kabob with curry sauce, rice and salad. Wine selection was great and not expensive . Highly recommend this place !"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,2,6/28/15,"This review is written by a non-German.I can understand why this restaurant is popular. The food is well prepared; The kitchen does not use MSG; and the taste is clean. That said, there is little body, little depth, little flavor in the dishes that were prepared.I asked the Thai server in Thai language for a very spicy dish. It was so mild, it was a mockery. It is my suspicion that Germans/German food/the German palate isn't accustomed to the range of spices (even if not ""spicy"") that ethnic cuisines provide. The flavor spectrum skews toward the bland.  With Indian cuisine in Berlin, I experienced a similar problem: mild, bland, and muted. That's hard to recommend if one knows what Thai cuisine is supposed to taste like. If one's preferences are towards the bland, go for it. It's a little expensive, as the portion of Ka Prow was modest. Also, again: I'm not German -- the bottle of sparkling water was more than the appetizer (and more than a large beer).Wouldn't go back, but one could certainly do worse.Two stars for the clean, non-MSG food and the truly honest vegetarian preparation (upon request) for no fish or oyster sauce."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,5/14/14,"Believe me, i love thai food and i visited.thai restaurant so many time over all the world. Its not good. Its something missing taste, something is not right. Its too pricy for taste. Coco with milk shake was ok. But all foods... its not good. If u dont know the real thai food taste probably its ok to accept but if u know thai food? Then i dont recommend."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/30/16,"This was a great Thai restaurant. We ordered the Prince entry (chicken kebabs, prawn in pastry and spring roll) and a pumpkin chicken yellow curry. Entry was tasty but the star was the main course. A mild curry but the flavor was definitely there. Would return without hesitation."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/3/14,"We came here on a craving for Thai food and were more than happy with our selection. We ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert and special drinks and every single thing we ate was perfectly cooked and flavorful. All of the portions were substantial. My favorites were the homemade iced tea with limes & brown sugar, the Thai Inside rolls, the Pad Thai Jeh, and the Khanomglueihohm (steamed banana with coconut meat and ground cashew nuts served with a coconut milk sauce). The service was fast and the waiters were extremely attentive filling our waters and taking dishes when needed. I can't wait to go to Thai Inside next time I visit Berlin!"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,4,12/20/12,"Visited this place because of good reviews of food. They were not wrong at all.The atmosphere was cosy and service was very good. We decided to order insider menus, which included many different dishes form the menu. If you don't know what to eat, choose the insider menus.The portions were decent sizes, so even hungry travelers can get their stomachs full. They also put some effort to the display, the salads especially are well made and beautiful. The food was good - not the best Thai food I have eaten but worth the money. Dinner for two with wines was 60-70 euros (including starters, main course and dessert), so not that expensive at all.The place is quite small, so on weekends I presume a table reservation would be a good thing."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,4,12/4/14,Cute spot. Loved the Thai food. Highly recommended! Staff were super friendly as well. I will be returning to this place next time in in Berlin for sure!
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,7/18/15,"Moderately authentic, good customer service (quite a relief from the typically brash Berlin service), beautifully decorated food, relaxing ambience and proximity make this place a pit stop if you are in the area and super hungry for Thai food."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,5,9/9/12,"Very good Thai restaurant.Tasty dishes and nicely decorated.Ordered ice tea which was too sweet for my taste, the waiter took it back and brought us two free drinks insteadHighly recommended!"

For one of the dishes we asked specifically that they do not put nuts in (as my wife as a mild allergy) and surprise surprise... there were nuts in there! The waiter initially denied that it was nuts, but after his detailed examination he eventually apologised and bought out a new one.Prices are a bit more expensive compared to other similar Thai places around the area but the portions are ridiculously small. Also, the curry we ordered practically had no sauce in it! I'm sorry to say that I won't be going back there anytime soon as there are certainly many better places around the area."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,2,7/21/11,"Really marginal, overpriced Thai food.  Isn't the appeal of Thai food that it's usually inexpensive, plentiful and flavorful.  It tasted okay, but the portions were tiny and the prices were astronomical for Thai food (42 Euro for dinner for two?  At a Thai place?  Really?).  Yes, they carve vegetables into neat little shapes, but there must be better options.  My guess is that they're able to take advantage of their location near Alexanderplatz.  Really strange considering it's in the heart of old East Berlin.  Skip it."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,1,6/16/14,"Last time I check , tip or not to tip the service was still voluntary in this country. I double checked with Ritz Carlton reception. Here I am, in this thai food place, trying to have a conversation with my fianc?e, and then the bill came. I paid with cash but the change never found its way back. I waited for a while. Then the lead staff came and ask me if everything was ok (meaning why r u still sitting here). I said I was waiting for the change. She said it was tipped to them. What? Why didn't I know about it? And if I want to tip, at least I get to decide who I give it to. But I guess this lead staff just want to keep it to herself. (My waiter was a boy and was sent away by her conveniently) the whole action is disgusting. Oh, did I mention they were located right underneath the train tracks? U can see it on the map. It won't be easy for you to hear anything, let alone ""enjoy yourself so much that you want to tip""! I rarely gave 1 star, but this place... I'd give a minus if I can. Please save yourself from this kind of greedy business. U know you are not that desperate to get good food (tons of better choices in that area), and U also know they are not that good for you to be desperate!"
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,9/10/08,"Thai inside offers nice food unlike the usual Thai cuisine one is often used to. Therefor it's a bit pricey alright but if you like the difference and nicely styled meals/plates then go there.Me, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked to as the 2 waiters were both a bit inattentive and slow. The food itself lacked a bit of flavour but it was still not too bad.If you like to sit outside you'd have to put up with the rail tracks being directly opposite the restaurant as well as the street itself. However the interior looks calm and clean.I'd say it might be worth the checking out for yourself."
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,5,1/1/13,Be careful about the meaning of a little bit chili :D
Thai Inside,Thai,4,?11-20,3,11/24/08,"I found the place average when eating there today for lunch. Decor is nice, service is average and the food was not memorable. Location is quite good in Mitte but the area offers much more interesting dining options. Seating outside would not be an option in the summer as it's just not a pretty street. I can't really saying anything was wrong with the place yet it didn't leave much of an impression which is a shame. So much more could be done with this place. You won't go wrong eating here but if you're choosy or often eat Thai, you may be disappointed by this restaurant."

Grab a blanket, go there on a sunny weekend day, and just order one of everything!The som tam of the first stand coming in from the north is fricking saep lai lai! If you're into pain, ask for two chilis. Then feel your mouth burn to tasty tasty ashes.Right next to that stand you will find some awesome meatball noodle soup. And further that way delicious mango sticky rice. I don't even know where they get such tasty mango in the wasteland that is Berlin.Down under one of the trees, there's also like a little market of sorts where you can buy some rare fruits and vegetables, depending on the season. I bought some delicious mangosteens here once and they were perfect.Anyway, just go and explore! Beware of the cocktails, though! They are like 50% alcohol and will only make you buy more food!"

Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/4/16,"A very unique Southeast Asia experience in Berlin. Sunday Thai market is a must if you can catch it. The food stalls are very make-shift. The Thai women and men set up shops on the grass with portable grills, pots and pans and sell the world's most delectable cuisine at a price that is 1990 in San Francisco, yes, it's that inexpensive it's like a tunnel back to the early 90s where food prices have not gone up. You can get chicken satay on stick for $1.1 each, and a bowl of excellent meaty brothy Thai noodle soup for $5.5. Note the 1 Euro = $1.1 exchange rate today. If you want something sweet, the mango sticky rice is the thing to get here. I have never seen a papaya salad that huge and tasty but the best were the colorful steam dumplings: different type of fillings from vegetarian to meat lovers. It's simply divine and if no one knows what I'm talking about, see the photos, duplicate the process, guaranteed instant success in the food truck scene in the bay area. It's completely insanely good. I walked around after a huge breakfast, soaking in the sun and then found a quieter bench near the children's playground. This is not hard to find. There are plenty of families and couples and friendly youngsters doing exactly the same. The rumor is that they may close it down soon. I think there is a not a permitting process. If only there is a place like this where things are beautiful, fanciful, and inexpensive in San Francisco. If only."

I got a mango salad, pad Thai, mojitos, a coconut, AND a coconut milk with jelly dessert. The mango salad was so fresh and yummy. Thin strips of mangos, lettuce, onions, scallions, fried onions, fish sauce, lemon juice. Amazing!!!!!! I ate it in maybe two minutes. Five euros.The pad Thai was pretty good! It had a few shrimps!

The coconut milk was so so good!!! I highly recommend this!Other honorary mentions: what my friends named ""the beef stick"" it was only a euro and it's just some beef on a stick.

Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/26/15,"I've been living in this neighborhood for three years now, and only this past weekend have I actually went to the Thai meadow in Preussenpark, where several Thai women set up benches and cook food and sell it to others for rock bottom prices.Honestly, we came late, so we didn't have a good sample. We came around 16:00, which, even though there was still an ample selection of food, some people were already packing, suggesting that if we came in a few hours earlier, then there would have been more interesting choices.I got a 3 EUR ""small"" Pad Thai (gotta sample the Pad Thai as a first timer), and I say ""small"" because it was actually large for 3 EUR. I could only imagine how much food the ""large"" 5 EUR plate was. My companion on the other hand got a 3 EUR spicy soup.I am giving this place 4 stars, for now, because I haven't seen the utmost potential this place has. I'll go back in the next weekend or so, and early, so the food will be warmer, and there will be more selections."
Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/13/15,"Last weekend I finally had the chance to visit the Thaiwiese but since it was already November, not many people were selling food, in summer the whole park is apparently packed with people and sellers.First off I went for papaya salad and when I asked the lady for a small portion,  she replied with ""no small"" so I paid 5 bucks for normal portion. She justified the price with saying ""papayas are expensive"", well right she but still...however I rather pay more for a ""homemade"" meal than for an overpriced dish at a restaurant and to be fair; the salad was tasty!Next I tried some fried dumplings which were kinda disappointing, very greasy and pretty flavorless.Although I didn't have the best price/value or taste experience there is still a lot that I haven't tried and I just love the idea of trying food from a foreign cuisine that is prepared by people from that country, mostly grandmas that cook like that every day and use authentic recipes, so I definitely recommend visiting the Thaiwiese, preferably in summer!"
Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/19/16,"Some nice lady made a plate of Pad Thai for me.  It was 5 Euros.  I sat on a rock and ate it with a 2 Euro Becks.  I made funny faces with a little Thai kid who thought I was cool as beans while I ate my Pad Thai with chopsticks.  It was love.  I have never had Pad Thai so good.  She put all sorts of stuff on it.  It was so tasty, crunchy, hot, sweet, savory.  I told the lady that it was great.  She could not speak any English.  I tried in Germany...no luck.  I made belly rubbing motions and smiled.  I think she got that.  Then I got a caipirinha from another nice lady and it was very tasty.  It was a fun experience.  Very chill.  Cool people.  Bring a blanket and make an afternoon out of it."
Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/28/15,"Thaipark, what can I say....we came back twice in the week, once on a weekday and again on a sunny saturday. Weekdays are dependant on weather mostly, but can carry on until 7/8pm onwards and have fewer options on the stall front. On a sunny Saturday you will find the park full of people and stalls and get to see the market at its best,so I do recommend making time for it if you have the chance.I mostly consumed papaya salad and caipirinhas for both visits, which were both fantastic but next time I'll be a bit more adventurous..My friend tried a stall with what we think was a dish slightly like pho, with pork meat cooked quickly in oil and noodles in a meaty/star anise broth and a tray with different chilli pastes/sauces to add. The lady hands you your pink bowl and cutlery and I'm told it was great, with the flavour and heat building gradually. On Saturdays the lady at the papaya salad stall that's quite big and has seats in front will let you count how many chillis you want and let you taste in between using the pok pok. Although the ladies are all selling caipirinhas, if you want taste over generous alcohol content I would recommend the stall with the Brazilian flag on the Saturdays. Take out a few hours and bring a blanket, the Thaipark is really good fun and hopefully it stays that way for a long time."

Thaiwiese im Preu?enpark,Thai,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/16/13,"One of my favorite places in Berlin. So many of my friends haven't heard about this secret gem hidden in the former city 'West.' Most people I know live in the former east and therefore have yet to get to experience or haven't even heard of thai park.Visit between April - Oct when the weather is decent and you will find little stations setup offering traditional Thai dishes, drinks and snacks. Most dishes cost 5 Euros.Bring a blanket with you and if you are open to sharing, have each person in your group order something different and then each it family style.Hightlights:- Everything! Especially the favor bomb that happens in your mouth. Sometimes we know what we are eating and sometimes we take a leap of faith. Last time the lady said to me,""pig and blood and very spicy."" I said, ""Okay!."" Ha ha.- The thais playing board games, giving massages and sometimes mani / pedis (which is a little wierd) in the park.- The sound of Thais communicating with one another followed by lots of laughter.- The Brazilian lady who sets up a caipirinha stand = amazing!- My favorite stations is the Pad Thai station. I have yet to see her this season. : (- Watching the vegetable suppliers seperate all of their goods and sell them to the various stations.- During the season, there was a lady that would clean and sell Pfferlinger.Lowlights: There are none!Nancy"

We were staying near Alexanderplatz and so this was not too far away. He claims it is too hipster of a place but I actually really liked the d?cor and the fun vibe of the place. We shared the stuffed rice crepes and the bahn bao. Both were really delicious.

Food is really good and nicely decorated (I had b?nh gi?, and the woman sitting next to me had chicken congee whose smell was so wonderful I almost ordered one myself). But coffee is not that special and a bit overpriced imo (but again, I'm Vietnamese so I can be a bit picky). Friendly service.

I don't frequent this neighborhood often, and so I was impressed with the interesting selection of shops and cafes in this area, such as this Vietnamese cafe.I ordered a Vietnamese coffee, authentically served in these metal brewing contraptions, sitting on top of a glass, where coffee slowly drips on a dollop of condensed milk. I also ordered a banh bao, filled with roast pork. The rice cake tasted authentic; while I have never been to Vietnam, I have encountered several rice cakes in the past from various different countries, and this one definitely matches the taste and consistency.I love this place. They have regular Western style coffees too, but why would you order such a thing when you're in a Vietnamese cafe? I also love the decor. I am not sure they have wifi, but then, with their low tables and cozy interior, this cafe is more for hanging out and actually connecting with live people than with online ones."

Whenever I feel a bit cranky or moody, or when just tired, I go their for this soup for a fantastic pick me up. It's easy to lose focus on a simple dish when you can make more money with your more complex dishes, but the love and care they put on the kongee has me being a long time fan - I also bring people here and recommend the place to many people as well."

Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,6/25/16,"A great Korean restaurant in Berlin!Berlin definitely doesn't have access to the same ingredients and resources that NYC does but this restaurant is doing well with what they got.They gave us five plates of side dishes, but there was too little kimchi. When we asked for more, they didn't give it to us because they kept forgetting. They're really understaffed which is clearly hurting them right now.We got the dumplings, kimchi pancake, beef bulgogi, and pork belly. The BBQ was descent. Quality of meat isn't great but for the price, they are very generous with the quantity and we were satisfied. Kimchi pancake was odd. It was really deep fried rather than more doughy and the taste of kimchi was barely there. However it was still quite tasty. I will definitely go back here! It's super cheap. However, it doesn't have great service. I didn't feel angry because I felt bad for them. They're working hard and trying their best but it's just not working.Overall, my friends and I ate a ton of food for ten euros each. I will certainly go back but I hope they can revamp a bit!!--------------I just went back and got the duck. It was crispy on the outside and very meaty. Delicious. Definitely a bit too salty but it was good. My friend ordered the bibimbap and asked to replace the beef with tofu. They were very understanding and made the adjustment. The veggies in the bibimbap were pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. They also refilled our banchan(side dishes) this time! Good experience but still keeping it at three stars for now."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,4/28/16,"Great place for Korean BBQ. Really reasonable price and huge portions compare to other Korean places in Berlin. We had the bibimbam and the BBQ pork. When the giant plate of raw meat on the portable grill arrived at our table, our jaws just dropped. Both the rice dish and the BBQ were delicious. The bachan little dishes has unlimited refill and they were perfect with cold beer."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,2,5/15/16,Absolutely horrible food and humiliating service. The guy took our order after 20 min considering an empty restaurant. The mixed-meat bbq plate we got was all low quality meat. The waiter forgot our extra kimchi. Worst than all when you pass the backside and go to the bathroom you face a horrible mess of random things laid everywhere and you wonder if that's how they organize the kitchen. Overall the experience was full of regret!
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,11/9/16,"Nice place and good price! Cheaper than Hodori ( same boss ), afternoon discount also available here!"
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,2/7/15,"It's quite an experience to come here. The place is a bit hidden and doesn't look that inviting from the outside. Also the inside is a bit shocking at first glance as everything looks old and a bit dirty. If you manage to overcome the first shock and can stand the dirty menus, you'll enjoy some great Korean food. It's probably the best I tried in Berlin and really tastes super authentic. Just leave after you're done right away and remember the great taste. Love it! Cash only."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,12/29/15,"Amazing Korean food!! We had the niangao hotpot, sweet sour pork and grilled octopus. They were all very authentic. The honey melon ice cream was also great. We paid 20 euro each. But we also ordered too much XD. The only disappointment is that the staff was very unfriendly."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,11/10/15,"I definitely recommend this slightly hidden place to lovers of authentic Korean food. The prices are fair, service is good, and the food delicious from what I can tell after my first visit. We had the Bibimbap which is always a good measurement and it was just how I like it. Crispy on the bottom, lots of veggies and meat and the still runny egg on top. I recommend getting that! The little starter dishes were excellent too. Only reason they're lacking one star is because I was slightly disappointed with the Kimchi Jeon (pancake). If you love deep fried, go for it, it was certainly tasty. But I personally know and prefer that dish to have a little higher Kimchi to deep fried batter ratio. I'll definitely be back and try other dishes next time."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,11/8/15,"sweet potato starters and kimchi pork tofu main soooo goood.Amazing architecture. Really slow service. Great."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,3/15/15,"Great food, unique grill experience, affordable prices. Service and interiour should be better."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,5/1/16,"This place is awesome. Really legit Korean BBQ, best for big parties but also saw quite a few couples. My Bibimbap was perfect, the dumplings and soup I tried were delicious, and the meat was just... Well anything touched by gojujang (that red stuff) becomes awesome. On top of that it's really cheap and you get unlimited bachan (tapas). Only downer here was that our refill of kimchi was not actually kimchi but cheap sauerkraut with chili...? That was sad... But hey it was free."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,11/25/14,"Little Korea in Berlin - very authentic restaurant with a good selection of Korean dishes. Good spicy kimchi to start with, but fewer starters than I am used to from other Korean restaurants. We had the bibimbap and a Koran pancake with seafood. I liked the simplicity of the rice dish - the pancake however was too greasy and hard to digest."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,1/3/16,"Bibimbap here is not as good as other Korean restaurants that i tried. Waiter/ waitress cant speak english. Beside that, everything is good. Reasonable price.  Recommend watermelon ice-cream for dessert."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,6/30/15,"So this little Korean restaurant wasn't bad for a quick fix for some Korean food but some things were lacking overall. For as much Korean food I like to eat I would say it wasn't as ""tasty"" as a normal Korean place I'm use to. Granted I had only one dish. I would have to say it wasn't as good as I had hoped it to be. For the reviews that say it's a dirty place, I wouldn't say it's a ""dirty"" place but run down. It just needs a lot of TLC to get it looking good again. I would return again to try another dish in hopes of raising my score here but sadly time won't permit it. Authentic food, slightly run down place, no English menus but the waiter spoke a little English."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,2/20/15,"Good Korean Food served.  Many many choice from menu. Many choice on beer menu as well. Have Soju and Mag-Gul-Lie too. Prices are very reasonable. We ate Kim-Chi-jji-Gae, Kal-Bi-Tang, Dol-Sot-Bibim-Bap, Bul-GoGie. These were taste very good.However, Hae-Mul-Pa-Jun is not recommended.  Too thick and was not tasty at all. Other than that, this family running business was delight.Do not expect a fancy restaurant. But if you want to have a Korean food, this is it"
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,4/10/15,"I've been here several times I don't even check in at Yelp every time or make any comment. But the crowds inside at peak hours would give you 100% confidence about their food and price. Somehow some mysterious power always leads me back to this restaurant suddenly without a plan or makes me cancel another plan for this : ) one thing not so relevant is I'm very impressed by Koreans for this restaurant generally gives big quantity for sides (considering no extra charge ) regardless how much you ordered for the paid dish, Koreans i met are very nice and possitive people even tho they might not always show you a smiley face."
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,8/11/14,"I visited Arirang with some friends and had a very good experience.The restaurant itself is a bit hidden and doesn't look too fancy from outside. The inner decor is also quite simplistic and not too elaborate. We sat outside, as the weather was very nice and the atmosphere was a bit better there.Then we ordered a menu for 4 people (the price was about 48?) which included Samgyupsal (korean BBQ), Kimchi Jiggae (Kimchi stew), korean style chicken, Kimchi Pajeon (something like a savory pancake), a korean style salad, a crispy duck dish and a round of banchans (korean side dishes).It was as much as it sounds as we were completely stuffed even after eating for two hours and packing some rests as take away. For about 12? per person - an awesomely good deal!The korean BBQ was very delicious, as well as the Kimchi Jiggae (though not as spicy as usual) and the korean salad (surprisingly good), but the highlight were the korean style chicken - we all enjoyed it a lot.The pajeon was soso - a bit bland and too flappy. The crispy duck was average too, something they'd sell at every ""chinese"" imbiss.So overall, the prices there are very affordable (especially when you're with a large group and order a menu), the quality of the food differs from dish to dish. I myself was quite impressed with this restaurant and will definitely come back again!"
Arirang,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,7/21/14,Daily Korean food. Dirty and unfriendly and so many Asian customers. That shows the quality of the food. Price is really cheap and the portions are very satisfying. It's a good restaurant to enjoy some unusual atmosphere.
Carabao,Thai,4.5,?11-20,3,1/19/14,"I thought hard whether I would give this place 3 or 4 stars. In the end I am giving it 3. I was here with two other companions tonight for dinner. I picked this place because it was recently featured as a restaurant that had interesting fusion cuisine. Well, it was fusion, yes, but only at the menu. They featured Thai and Bavarian dishes. But the dishes didn't really fuse those two cuisines. That being said, I thought that the idea was novel and so I convinced my two companions to check it out with me.When we got there, the place was empty. There was only one other table with diners, and so I guess our reservation wasn't really needed. It always makes me suspicious whenever you have places like these. You would think, why aren't people eating here? Anyway, we still ate, and I ordered a duck ped khee mao. I asked it Thai spicy, and sure enough, it delivered. It rearranged my sinus' plumbing system. It was good. Good thing I had half a liter of beer to wash it down with.That being said, as much as the food was good, I don't think it was great, I don't think it was great enough for me to give it 4 stars. It was okay, it was not bad. But it failed to make me think that they had food that are better than the other Thai places I have been to. It doesn't have the extra oomph to make it more special than others, and therefore I can just give it an average rating. And I am not even talking about the fact that we were the only diners there after half an hour (since the other table left). Of course, it was a Sunday, so people probably don't eat out too much on a Sunday, so I am not even counting that as a factor in my rating.Overall, they have good food. I didn't try the Bavarian side of the menu, but if I want Thai, even though they give a pretty powerful ped khee mao, it wasn't distinguishing itself from the other restaurants I have been to. Though I have to say, they do pass the Leitungswasser Test."
Carabao,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,8/10/15,"There should be a way for people who like spicy food to find OTHER people who like spicy food on Yelp. All I can say is: I'm from Southeast Asia, and I've never had such authentic food outside of the region in a decade of living on three continents :)"
Carabao,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,12/8/11,"Interesting mix of restaurant and bar, of Thai, Tapas, and Bavarian food. I only tried Thai: spicy is indeed spicy and the taste is authentic. I prefer sitting outside, if possible."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,10/4/12,"My companion took me here one night for a feast. He was telling me that this is an awesome place, as the people who manage this restaurant are actual Thai people, unlike most other places here. And sure enough, when the waiter realized that one of us spoke Thai, German was turned off, and Thai became the lingua franca.Gosh, this place was amazing. We ordered several things; unfortunately, as I did not do the ordering (except for one item, the entrails soup), I don't really know what they were called in Thai. So we ordered 1) the entrails soup, consisting of lungs, liver, blood, stomach, and other items simmered in noodles and tofu; 2) hot papaya salad; 3) a ground chicken dish with interesting herbs; and 4) sauteed shrimp. All of the orders were ordered ""Thai spicy"" which meant that the Thai people made it the way they usually eat it. Oh, we also ordered sticky rice to accompany things.Oh my god, my pores screamed. My throat got parched. Good thing the Thai iced tea was amazing. It was hot, but it was great. I loved it. I would definitely go back here. I would love to try their other offerings, but I would still get another round of that entrails soup. So yes, this is amazing, and is one place that I wouldn't mind bringing someone to enjoy some authentic Thai cuisine."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,3,2/19/16,"Came here again for lunch. I got the same thing (nam tok moo or the pork noodles) and my friends got green curry, red curry and fried rice. Plus appetizer which is the shrimp spring roll.The shrimp appetizer was a bit pricey ?7 but it was huge. The fried rice tastes and smells exactly like those that you would get in Thailand. The soup for the noodles was a bit too thick for me but it was great! Interestingly they put sausage in the bowl along with pork?!? But it is ok. My friends enjoyed their curry.However, the service was pretty horrible this time. This server seems a bit annoyed by our presence... She manages to make me feel like We were bothering her ?!? Otherwise, the owner was super nice and the server we got last time as well. I guess it is just this person but -1 star for that.Also, my friend got coke which was ?2ish but he didnt get the whole can/bottle but it came in a glass. Not sure if the glass was equivalent to one bottle but it was just weird for us. Also, no tap water :("
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,7/12/17,"This is certainly the best Thai food I had in Berlin so far. It is very well above all the other semi Thai restaurants that offer a bit of Asian fusion cuisine. I especially like the Papaya Salad and the Chicken Satey. The curry is also very good. The place does get busy in the evening so reservation is advised. Great find, will certainly be back there soon."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,1,6/12/17,Two of us went to enjoy some Pad Thai and Tom Yam Gung.  We ordered 2 Pad Thai and one Tom Yam Gung Feuertopf with 2 beers.  We got charged 56euros.  I felt way too expensive so came home and searched the internet for their menu.  I compared my receipt and I was charged 2 euro more for each Pad Thai and 1 euro more Tom Yam Gung.  even on their deliveroo site pad thai price is 13.90 where they usually add on the delivery cost.  what a scam.
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,2/12/17,"We found the restaurant by accident online when trying to find a good Thai restaurant. All I can say, it's worth going there. Food quality was excellent, so was the service. Certainly a place I will come back to."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,11/26/16,"One of the few Thai Select restaurants in the world. Excellent food, huge menu, portions are plentiful, and service is great. Short distance to Ku'damm and its shopping areas."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,1,6/13/17,"Avoid it! The service is super rude and the prices are way too high for the type of food! My friend asked in English the difference of two meals and the waitress just kept on replying ""This is not for you! It's for Thai people, not Europeans! This is not for you!"". Of course she got curious to ask for a typical Thai meal but the waitress kept on saying that so many times, that at the end was just awkward! It was not nice at all! I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/9/15,"The home made curry is great, the service is excellent and the location nice. If you like original Thai food, this is your place in Charlottenburg. Oh, and they have Thai cooking classes as well."
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/23/16,Absolutely excellent. Had the yellow beef curry and meo roll for an appetizer. Great service and food for a reasonable price!
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,5,1/6/16,Best Thai restaurant in Berlin by far! Green curry-very authentic (but make sure you ask for Thai spicy as they keep it safe with heat for your regular German customer :). Portion sizes are generous and staff is wonderfully friendly- a must when in Charlottenburg!
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,3,2/1/15,"Let me start by saying I love Thai food. Next to Sushi, it's my go to favorite. Found this place on Yelp and thought I'd give it a try. Walked about 30 minutes to get there. Long story short, not worth the walk. Sub par service and just decent Thai food. I should have known when it was 7pm and there were only two couples dining on a Saturday night.The biggest bummer was the shrimp Tom Kha soup I ordered. It was tasty but way way overpriced for what it was. Literally two shrimp in the large soup, a joke by itself. Ten bites later, the super small portion was gone. Green papaya salad not at all authentic Thai.  Pad Thai, sadly disappointing as well. Won't be back. My suggestion is look on Yelp for a better option.Ok.....I'm going to revise my earlier review. I was craving Thai food again and since the other reviews were pretty good I decided to give this place another shot. Much better experience than before. I'm not changing my mind on my first experience, I'm just saying this time it was much better. Tried the Tom Kha soup again but this time got the hot pot. Delicious and very authentic Thai. And, there was actually enough shrimp in it. Going from a one star to a three. I just might be back :)"
DAO by Meo,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/10/13,"Good quality Thai food. Fresh and good quality ingredients. Light, flavorful, well-balanced dishes. Nice staff. Good atmosphere with tables on the sidewalk. But most of all, good food."

Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,12/11/16,"Ordered over Foodora. They are not the fastest to make food but they are REALLY good. If you are fine with waiting then definitely order from them. Portions are big and the flavor is amazing. Definitely would be ordering again from them"

Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,7/3/16,"I'm surprised to see lots of five-stars on yelp for this moderate restaurant. We ordered Korean BBQ and were served with undercooked rice. The lady waitress immediately changed new bowls of rice for us, but even the new ones were undercooked. This is an incredible kind of mistake I've ever seen at an Asian restaurant.When our first serving of beef neck meat arrived at the table, we were alert that they were too thin for being made BBQ. We cooled the oven a little bit, but the lower temperature didn't help fix the texture of the meat. They were so chewy (hard) that I really think they need a replacement or marination.Fortunately our second serving of pork butt was fine and we were comforted by it. But having said that, it was not a satisfactory experience for me."
Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,7/30/15,"Gangnam pocha is a hidden gem! I loved the food, authentic, reasonably priced and very tasty.Ordered two orders of pork (samgyupssal) and beef stew (gom tang), there was an egg dish (gyran-jjim) that came with it for free while at other places you have to pay for it. Also, side dishes (banchan) that also came with the pork gave a very generous amount where at some restaurants you also have to pay for side dishes.No highchairs, not kid friendly."
Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,9/21/15,"Love this place for solid korean bbq.  The steamed egg is super tasty and they have nice kimchi and other sides.  I wish they had gas grills rather than the electric ones inside, but we discovered last time if you sit outside you get to use a gas grill.  I highly recommend trying to sit outside because it taste so much nicer grilling with gas but all in all it's a great find.  Our favorites were the pork belly and bulgogi and the fried pork belly and kimchi dish is really really good! Owner was really friendly and we had a nice chat in broken german and english."
Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,1/17/15,They have a great special at this moment. The fried sweet and hot chicken! Super with beer.
Gangnam Pocha,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,4/21/15,"Great menu, not just the same old bibimbab, but small enough selection to guarantee high quality. They seasonally have dogbukki (spicy, chewy rice cake with fish cake) soju cocktail, golbeangi mujim (spicy sea snails with cold noodles) whatever you need when you crave seoul food. The interior is nothing special but it's clean and inviting."
Guten Dag,Chicken Wings,5,Under ?10,5,11/11/16,"It's just so good, I don't even know what to write.  The chicken is tender, it's perfectly fried, and the spicy sauce is just so good.  I don't know what's in it, but I want to know.  The guys are always really nice too, so that's always a big plus.  I'm not even hungry now, but I want some.  What are you doing still reading this review?  Go get some already."
Bab & Kimchi,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,5,9/1/17,"One of the best bibimbap we had ! This cozy and heartwarming Korean restaurant worths dropping by And the cherry on top is the bill, super cheap !"
Bab & Kimchi,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/14/17,"Bab and Kimchi is a small and adorable venue in the south of Berlin, located next to S Feuerbachstr. For those who still don't know: It's kind of close to that Primark in Schlo?stra?en Center.Their menu is small but the food was quite good. All ingredients were fresh, the kimchi spicy and the staff nice. I'd love to come back when I am around, but it's too far to travel all the way just for their bibimbab."
Bab & Kimchi,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,3,2/16/16,"Food was great. Reasonably priced and taste good. Portion was generous. Was going to give 4 starsThe place was clean and the menu offered is just a basic stuff like bibimbap and tofu kimchi. The place is tiny but has a nice vibe to it. The lady behind the cashier who took my order is not korean and nor is the person in the kitchen (i was a bit surprised) but the food was greatMy problem comes when we asked for the check. I got the tofu kimchi which was supposed to be ?5.9 but she told me ?7.5 same as my friends who got bibimbap ?!? So I said that I got tofu kimchi which if I recalled should be cheaper than bibimbap ?7.5 she later corrected it but still i dont know how she came up with ?7.5 in the first place. She was reading it off the bill which means the bill was wrong as well? Not sure if this is just an honest mistake or she was trying to rip me off but it was such a simple that should not cause any confusion or stupid mistake. Totally ruined my meal and thus -1 for that"
Bab & Kimchi,Korean,4.5,Under ?10,3,5/7/17,"We ate bibimbap. Not the best, and they don't serve it with egg. Was OK. Could be spicier. They got good sake tho. :3"

FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/6/17,"Visiting from New York City  for only five days and was lucky enough to be brought to this exquisite restaurant by my friend Jake. Better than any of the restaurants back home - freshest flavors and most delicious combinations I've encountered. Tofu has never tasted so good - whether quickly deep fried or saut?ed or smoked. Shumai and wontons were perfect and light and wasabi shrimp out of this world.  And how can a humble cucumber salad be that amazing?Gracious service; beautiful outdoor setting, lovely bottle of Albari?o and above all scrumptious food. A must."

GO ! GO!  TRY! TRY!"
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,12/9/16,"Nothing special. It's pretty much your average Chinese place, but a bit more expensive. The dim sum is better than the Hauptgerichte."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,1,4/2/16,"Really confused by the reviews and I am not even a foodie.  I had their version of Kung Po chicken and it was almost inedible and the dish was about 50% oyster sauce with very little meat.  They do have a nice outdoor eating area if you just want to have a beer, but I would stay away from the food if you are remotely used to real Chinese food."

MaKy,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/23/16,"Insanely huge pho bowls! Very delicious broth, which does get boring after a while. I had to add sriracha because it started tasting like water. It's kind of difficult to eat the noodles but I guess I'm just unskilled. Table service restaurant and only ?5.50 so I can't complain much. They have curries as well which I guess I might prefer."
MaKy,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/24/15,"We enjoyed our meal here, the service was good, not incredible. The food was also really good, lots of flavour and very fresh and tasty. Huge portions, and quite cheap for the amount of food you got. The atmosphere wasn't as nice, the music was really awful and very distracting. But good for a filling, tasty lunch"
MaKy,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,5/5/15,"Delicious noodle soups (pho), glass noodle salad and homemade lemonade. They won't be able to accept credit cards until mid-May '15 so bring cash. Very clean and neat place with friendly service."
MaKy,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/15/15,Their Thai dishes are so yummy like I've had in Thailand and have not had in most Thai places outside Thailand. Very friendly service.
MaKy,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/23/15,"I live just down the street and go to maky about once a week -- take out or dine in. It's delicious. I especially recommend the mango sauce, and make sure to try their pho and chicken sate."
Hoan Kiem,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/12/15,"Really really good!Also really cheap, its in a corner street of turmstrasse so a bit hidden but totally worth it to visit. The duck was excellent"
Hoan Kiem,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/16/15,"You seriously can't go wrong here. We trusted Yelp in leading us to this place and we weren't disappointed. They spoke English and the food was amazing. I ordered the crispy duck which was to die for. It was cooked perfectly. I also got a mojito which was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the pho and said it was good, but not the best. We also ordered spring rolls and cleaned the plate. I hope to go back before I leave Berlin.Service was super friendly and fast."
Hoan Kiem,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/20/16,Really good food and prices! The service also was super! I would recommend the Pho and any type of noodle. Also they have various types of asian beers.
Hoan Kiem,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/8/13,"Just came from this eatery and was pleasantly surprised. We tried two crispy duck dishes. One with peanut sauce the other with sweet and sour both were delicious. I would say the peanut dish was a cut above the sweet and s our but both were very satisfying. The duck was so good, I kid you not melt in your mouth, deep gamey flavor good. The lady who served us was really nice came to check on us and everything while we were eating. Average prices but I feel like I'll be going back to get some more of that duck. Qauck, qauck quack..."

Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/29/16,"I came in here after seeing that everyone had rated this restaurant 5 stars (since I couldn't believe it myself).  And I'm glad I did.  I came in around 9PM, and was so happy they were still open.  Even at 9PM, many tables were still full.  I ordered a curry dish and the ""summer rolls"".  I was trying to order the spring rolls but accidentally ordered the summer rolls, which turned out to be egg rolls.  They also prepare foods really quickly because I think I was there for about 7 minutes total and then asked them if I could come back in 10 minutes (Because I was gonna get a something to drink across the street), and they told me that the food would be ready within two minutes!I brought the food back home and it tasted so good! I forgot what was inside but it was a good alternative to the spring rolls.  The sauce was really good too.  The curry was so amazing, super flavorful, lots of delicious veggies, and a good rice to curry ratio.  10/10 would go again."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,9/27/17,"The ambiance of this place is what you would expect in a restaurant in Vietnam not particularly snazzy but good enough.The wait staff was friendly but there was only 1 so the service was a bit slow.We tried their curry duck which was very tasty. We also ordered this beef with stir fried veggies(spicy beef) that was probably a 3 star compared to the duck."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,12/29/17,"Summer roll was ok. Pho Soup had good taste but beef meet was tiny chunks only not steak pieces as it should be. Over all not bad."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/19/17,"Fresh, authentic food. Got the rice with veggies + tofu which sounds like a pretty simple dish but it had a flavourful, light sauce and was seasoned very well. Actually good rice as well (you'd be surprised at how bad some rice can be...). Fair price (5.50), came out fast, and service was fine."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,9/5/17,Quick bite if you just need to fill up some cravings for Vietnamese food. Huge portion at decent price. Service is fast and pleasant. You just need to remind them to make it much less salty if you prefer it that way. Vietnamese don't eat salty food like that. Owner told me they need to cook more salty because that is the way the German would have preferred.
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/31/17,"This place is really freaking good. I've been eating Viet food all of my life, and this place exceeded my expectations. I ordered the fried duck + rice + curry dish (Vit Curry) and my friend ordered one of the glass noodles dishes (Mien Xao Garnelen) and I might have to admit that this was one of the best Viet restaurants I've been to. The flavors were all there, they have real Sriracha, and great service!!"
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,6/11/17,I ordered G?i B? and my friend ordered fried duck with curry and rice. The dishes were very delicious and very convenient in price. In general this place is among our top choices of Viet food in Berlin.
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/13/17,Authentic. The servings are quiet large for the price. The service is friendly and very helpful. At that price share the different starters which are wonderful. Cash only.
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,8/11/16,What can I say that hasn't been said. It was a surprise as I got in just for the sake of eating something becuase I was starving... What I found was the perfect thing.
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/14/16,"Small, good quality lunch place. This is at least my perception. Service was fast and polite, kitchen operated quickly, dishes were decent size and taste. Other than that it is hard to name any additional advantages. Definitely not a place for dinner. Typical Vietnamese menu, nothing to write home about."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,4/24/17,Super fresh pho and delicious spring rolls! Hostess was charming and very nice. Highly recommend it
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/6/16,"First I didn't plan to eat but when I saw the yelp-sign in the window and the pictures in the menu I just had to try.Best spring rolls I've ever eaten and very good price. Only positive comments about the food and service - but remember to bring cash since they don't accept credit cards.So if you're looking for an Asian restaurant, with good flavours and excellent vegetables at a reasonable price - this place is it!"
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/25/15,"Excellent food, excellent prices...done and done. We were looking for something to eat on our first night in Berlin and stumbled across Thanh Nho.  We had no expectations but soon found from the sip of the first drink that this place was going to be good.  We had the ginger tea, lemon mint ginger tea, Mojito, chicken satay and a beef/rice dish.  Every item we now would recommend.  We knew the Mojito would be great by the time it took him to make it and it arrived perfect...the best Mojito I have ever had.  Perfect muddled mint and lime and alcohol content. Well done Thanh Nho, well done. Everything was so good, including the prices, that we returned the next night (our final night in town) and ordered almost twice the amount of food including the sane as yesterday and now beef ginger ph?, fried lamb and rice, a Vietnamese rice spirit drink and the fried banana dessert. Everything was incredible again.  If we lived here, we would be regulars here."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/17/15,"Perfect vietnamese food from this little snackbar. Really flavorable, big portions, low prices, real vietnamese taste, super friendly girl that welcomed me in a devote way that is alien to Kreuzberg. I basically finally found my favourite vietnamese restaurant. For take-away."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/30/14,"We just moved to Sch?neberg and were looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant nearby. Thanh Nho serves delicious spring rolls, soup and noodle dishes. The staff are friendly and the pho and spring rolls are fresh and delicious. The ambience isn't anything too special, but the quality of the food is worth a visit."
Th?nh Nho,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/21/13,This place is awesome.  The food is delicious and the ambiance is relaxed.  Would very strongly recommend if you're in the neighborhood and looking for excellent Vietnamese.  Make sure to order the summer rolls with shrimp as an appetizer.
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/27/16,Love their food. The Vietnamese curry dishes are my favorite bit their noodle dishes are also very good. Nice environment and the owner is amazingly friendly.
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/14/15,Really tasty and great value! If you are around there and hungry this is a perfect fast solution. Thumbs up!
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/17/16,Best food and service in town. The owner is super friendly. I recommend ordering number 45! :D can Only recommend!
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,7/18/15,"Super delicous, huge portions and cheap! We split the two soups which were yummy and it cost us less than 5 ?! The curries looked really good but we were too full from the soup to try them."
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/21/13,Fantastic value and tasty dishes. Recommend the Vietnamese specials and starters. Don't be put off by the pictures of dishes on the wall and outside.
Dai An Asia,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/28/14,"Great value, hole-in-the-wall neighborhood joint offering fast, freshly prepared Asian dishes.  I went for the Vietnamese options usually and was not disappointed, especially given the price points.  I also liked how you could watch the kitchen staff prepare the summer rolls individually before each order.  Friendly service too."
Khwan,Thai,4,,4,10/21/17,"Really cool spot in the Craft and Smoke building on Revaler Strasse. It's hard to find but in a good way. The food is delicious, authentic, and really tasty. Staff was really friendly. I took off one star because the ventilation in the place is not great and had a funky smell. Also was somewhat expensive for a popup street food project in Friedrichshain."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/27/16,"Very inexpensive + fresh and flavorful = five stars.Found this place walking through Alexanderplatz. Menu and prices looked good, so we gave it a shot. So glad we did! Prices are ?5-?8 for carry out to dine in, the portions are sizeable (we were hungry after a day of walking!) and the food is cooked fresh and fast while you wait. Great sauces, crisp veggies, nicely cooked meats. For this price you can't do better."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,4/27/16,"Look, let me start by saying that, despite more good places popping up as of late, it can be really hard to find good Thai/Chinese/Eastern Asian type food, so it's all relative. So I am rating this place not on a grand scale of Asian food in Berlin, or even compared to the stuff I miss from the US, but relative to other Asian and specifically fast food places in Berlin.As far as quick eats Asian places, this is about as good as you'll find. ?4.50 will get you a box with lots of rice, veggies, and chicken (?1 more for duck) and your choice of decent sauces. After trying every other place around there this is the only place in this category that I have ever come back too, and now I come two or three times a week. Generally, avoid Alexanderplatz as all of the food around is garbage, but if you are there all of the time (I work one tram stop away, and food is worse by my office) and need a decent quick meal, this place is pretty solid."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/29/17,"Can't say I'd come to Berlin for Vietnamese food, but if I'm craving Vietnamese food in Berlin, I'd only come here.5/5 service! Our waiter was so kind, quick, and more than helpful when explaining the menu and the area for us tourists. I could be TOO used to the typical avoid-all-eye-contact European waiter treatment, but I was exceptionally happy with their communication and speed.We didn't have a reservation but he seated us as long as we finished within 1hr. They were fast with the food--and we ordered twice, separately, because it was so good--and still had time to spare.5/5 authenticity: I'm from the 626 in LA and grew up with Vietnamese food. My mother, raised in vietnam and a frequent diner in LA/OC, said this place might even be better than home. I really loved the bun Bo luc lot. We ordered two of the special plates with that, the summer rolls, fried sweet potato and shrimp, and egg rolls. ALL excellent! We took the durian drink to go, and my sister can't wait to come back."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/29/17,"Hands down, amazing Vietnamese food. VERY delicious egg rolls (they use banh trang for the skin, not wonton wrappers), lat lot, banh tom chien, and banh xeo. OMG I might say even more authentic than the Vietnamese food in LA. Almost like I'm eating in Vietnam.Also very helpful and nice server. He's the young guy. We got so much food for less than ?50. We spent just as much at another fries and fast food place.Will come back if I'm in Berlin again some day!"
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,4/28/17,"Free wifi and clean environment. Once we placed our orders our spring rolls came out quickly but with nuc mam (fish sauce based sauce) instead of the peanut based sauce which is non-standard for all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. We asked for peanut sauce and could tell the server didn't really speak English. They charged .50? for a cup of tap water with no refill. This is the first restaurant we've eaten at in Germany so not sure if that's normal or not.He also seemed to be the ONLY server for at least 7 tables so it was hard to get his attention. And gave up on asking for the traditional soup spoon for the Pho. He wasn't a bad server but definitely feel like they should have more than one guy tending to the customers.Despite the service flaws, the food was good! The pho tasted authentic and the red chicken curry was delicious."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/30/17,"The food here for the most part was spot on Vietnamese food I m used to eating in San Jose and Orange County, California. I liked the place a lot that I'm back here a second time after having a not so great experience at a Thai restaurant. Mind you I'm in Berlin and really should be eating German cuisine but I had my share of it so back to my comfort food-vietnamese ! The other day I tried bun cha gio (vermicelli w/egg rolls) & lotus salad. Loved the fresh flavor of the salad & I asked them to keep simple since I don't eat many green herbs. The bun cha gio was good but I kinda wished they didn't put the fish sauce on the bottom first... the banh xeo my companion tried was good though made slightly different with some sweet potatoes In it? For today we ordered the appetizer eggrolls and bo la lot (bethel leaves beef). It was great for appetizers. The morning glory veggie entree (rau muong) & thit kho tau (pork in claypot) was tasty. Just beware  of peppercorn if you are not used to it! Service was good enough for a Vietnamese restaurant. I would highly recommend this as place to go when craving authentic  Vietnamese food in Berlin. I saw pix of other vn restaurants' food and did not look authentic! I definitely think it would survive competition in San Jose & OC!"
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,4/12/17,"A modern corner restaurant with a cafe-like feel, serving a range of Vietnamese and Thai-style dishes.The menu consists mostly of a range of dishes which can be ordered with beef, chicken, prawns or tofu, giving vegetarians a decent choice (though note that some dishes have prawns or fish sauce added).Prices are very reasonable - under ?20 for two courses and a drink.Service is friendly and on our visit was very fast - the staff don't speak English but an English language menu is available."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,5/7/17,"Food was good but there was one server for 10 tables. He was not able to keep up at all, understandably."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,4/16/16,"Saigon Com Nieu is a South Vietnamese restaurant located near the Nollendorfplatz, which offers the specialty to cook rice in a stone pot that is popular in Vietnam.  Food: The menu includes many authentic dishes from Vietnam that I know from my childhood. We ordered Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancake), a mixed appetizer plate (incl. summer rolls, spring rolls, bo la lot and chicken sate sticks), Bun Bo Hue (Noodle Soup with Beef), Thit Kho Tau (Caramelized Pork with Eggs), Bun Cha Saigon (spring rolls and rice noodles), Bo lu lac (stir fried beef) and for dessert Che (vietnam. dessert with coconut milk/rainbow dessert). The mixed appetizer plate, the banh xeo and the dessert were very, very good and beautifully arranged. Especially the mixed appetizer plate and the Banh xeo were served on banana leaves in a bamboo basket with fresh herbs and salad, which I loved. The main dishes were rather disappointing. I was very excited for the rice cooked in the stone pot, but unfortunately the rice was too dry and not very tasty, the thit kho tau was delicious but the portion was too small while the portion of the Bo luc lac was huge for one person (both had the same price). It was tasty and decent. For the other dishes, I heard my companions say that it was good too. After finishing the main dishes, we ordered the Che for dessert, which was very delicious and refreshing, and on top we got orange slices on the house which was great and just perfect after the heavy dinner! In general the food was good, but it varies on what you order. NevertheIess, I would definitely recommend it :)Service: The waiters were fast but not very friendly. Maybe because there were quite a few guests and booked tables but only 2 waiters. I assume they were a bit stressed.Interior/Ambience: When I entered the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the show kitchen behind a glass window where a woman was preparing the stone pots for the rice. The interior is simple; mainly white with some green accents. The lighting was slightly to dark and greenish... Price: The prices are mid-ranged and totally okay for the amount of food. However if you order the dishes that are served with rice in the hot stone pots, be aware that they charge additionally 2 ? for the rice. So for the dish plus rice you would end up at around 10 ?, which is a bit pricey I have to say. For other dishes such as curry or noodle soups, the prices are okay!"
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/26/15,"Very tasty food, nr 144 was awesome. Authentic and flavoured.Staff is friendly, and the place is spacious. Would come back again."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,5/13/15,"Being Vietnamese and having spent a lot of time in Little Saigon in Orange County, California, it's difficult to find a restaurant that compares to the places you'll find on Bolsa. Not only does this place compare, but it reminds me of home cooking my grandma would make. I am happy and satisfied every time. And every time I've visited, there's always a table of Vietnamese people enjoying their meal. The difference between this place and most Vietnamese places in Berlin is that this is more Southern style. There's a slight difference between Northern & Southern Vietnamese cuisine. It's definitely worth checking out."
Saigon Com Nieu,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/30/15,"Pretty bang on being authentic Vietnamese!  This is definitely the best Vietnamese Ive eaten in Germany (actually Europe).  There is a very sweet lady who serves, the place is also pretty clean & comfortable.  I can't fault this place too much & will continue to go back here for more delicious food!"
Shikgoo,Korean,4,?11-20,4,2/24/15,"This small place is well hidden in the Tegelerstra?e. I passed by while I was on my way to the Indian restaurant next to it.The restaurant is in the sous terrain of the building and rather small but very cozy. After entering you find two areas to sit: One is with chairs and tables and the other one is a room with tatami mat and small tables where you can sit on cushion on the floor. But don't forget to take off your shoes first!The owner is just adorable. I love her and all the other staff. If you have any question or are new into Korean food don't be shy and ask instead! The waiter will gladly explain you everything.The menu is quite big compared to the size of the restaurant itself. You can choose between several starters such as mandu or kimbap. As main course they have 4 different bibimbap dishes, several bulbogi meals, soups and udon. You should also check out their tea card!At my first visit we had the udon noodles, kimbap, mandu, seafood soup and some extra kimchi.The price for the starters are really fair. The mandu are handmade as far as I can judge and the kimbap plate is quite big for 4?. The main dishes on the other hand are a bit too small for my taste but super delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the small amount of side dishes. On my second visit I went for bibimbap and mandu. Again... the bibimbap was super nice but a tiny bit too small. I ordered extra kimbap after finishing my bowl.Even though I'm a fan of big bowls I still love shikgoo. Maybe I just had the wrong dishes or a huge stomach. Who knows. Fact is: I've been here twice and I'll definitely come back!"
Shikgoo,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/9/16,"You won't expect the surprisingly good dining experience waiting for you in this place, by looking at it from outside!It is a small place and it offers both table with chair and the traditional Korean dining table so that you sit on the ground. We chose the later as we went with a larger group. It might be uncomfortable to sit that way if one is not used to it. The smallness of the place creates an intimacy and one feels quickly at home.The feeling of intimacy continues as when one takes off his shoes and as the waiter, perhaps also the owner, serving you with politeness. I had Bogogi with Schweinefleisch & tofu and I was satisfied with it. So were the others who were with me. But I have to say it is was nothing extraordinary."
Shikgoo,Korean,4,?11-20,2,9/28/16,"Nothing special, pretty bland tasting food. The meat wasn't close to being tender and juicy. There are so many better korean restaurants in Berlin. Go to Ixtys instead, for example."
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/1/17,"Great Burger! Super juicy & tasty! Also special mayo and ketchup. Really smth special!"
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/15/17,"Amazing food, slow service. Definitely recommend the food. The wasabi burger and the ramen burger was really good!"
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/13/16,"Oh my goodness - this was actually MAD good (as fusion usually is). I got a portion of the bulgogi fries and some hot wings. It was so much food, and so much goodness. Whoever invented the idea of bulgogi meat on your fries...is pure genius! Amazing!"
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,2,8/20/17,"Unfortunately a very mediocre place; I kind of had high hopes, it looks like a nice place from outside.. the burger is really mediocre (I had the kimchi burger), sweet potato fries were also very mediocre. It's one of those burgers that make you feel unsatisfied after you're done. Not because of the size - it's a medium to big sized burger - but you just feel dirty in a way after eating it. All in all there are many places that are worse, but definitely many places that are better: I'd give 2,5 stars if possible but 2 stars will have to do."
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/18/16,I recommend this restaurant. They have great burgers!!! Don't miss Wasabi burger :D. Very tasty and interesting
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,5,3/27/16,"Cool Korean style burger place. If you are walking down Sch?nhauser Allee or Kastanien Allee make sure to take a detour past this place. They only take cash, so have a ""bares"" on you. The interior is really cool, since it is all made of industrial pallets and the food is very nice as well. It would be one of the places I would recommend in the area of PrenzelBerg."
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/20/15,"When I first saw their promo sign before they opened ""Galbi is here"" I was intrigued because I noticed that a lot of korean joints in Berlin don't offer Galbi so obviously the opening day I went; coincidentally was crazy craving some Korean style wings and to my surprise, they had (still have) chicken wings! Chilees is CONSISTENTLY delicious. I have eaten for sit down about six times now, and ordered it for take out about four and to my surprise, it tastes exactly the same. My husband and I pretty much have tried everything on their menu.. Kimchi tofu burger: DeliciousKimchi burger: heavenly, my absolute favoriteKalbi burger: YUM!! But I want some kimchi on my burgerChicken wings: I can't even describe how good it is it is THAT goodKimchi bulgogi fries: delicSweet potato fries: delic I recommend this place to all of my friends and they're all equally obsessed. The burgers are so juicy and full of flavor, as are the wings. This is my favorite Korean restaurant in Berlin!!Offers high chairs. Very friendly staff. Cash only. Highly recommend everyone to try it"
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,2,6/23/16,Had high hopes for the ramen burger and after months of deliberation came here to test it out.  Left feeling underwhelmed.  Also had the bulgogi burger and that was better.
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,4,6/26/16,"The kimchi fries were a fail (overly saucy and the fries tastes like cheap deep fried fries from the frozen section) but the veggie tofu burger was sooooooooo delicious. I asked for the black bun because it looks awesome with it and let me tell you, the texture of the tofu was so nice and crispy, there were lots of fried onions, kimchi and other delicious stuff on that burger. So yummy!"
Chilees,Korean,4,?11-20,1,12/17/15,"We've order burgers through resto-in delivery service from Chilees. Food was cold and my steak burger had meat inside that was impossible to chew. All in all, will not go there and especially will not order delivery again."
Dokmai Thai-Restaurant,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/12/15,"Best Thai food in Berlin! Its really too bad that it isn't more centrally located. If it were we would be there every week.For a first visit, my husband and I went for some basics: pad thai and pad see ew. Both were very good! The pad thai was light with a good amount of chicken and tofu. The only thing I didn't like was the very large garnish which seemed wasteful. Like others have said, the restaurant is small, but we were able to walk right in for a weekday lunch without a wait."
Dokmai Thai-Restaurant,Thai,4,?11-20,4,9/3/17,"Authentic Thai food. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back. Keep in mind when ordering and wanting something  spicy: ask for Thai spicy. We asked for a little more  hot spice and barely could taste any.  Germans typically don't like super spicy foods so keep this in mind when ordering."
Dokmai Thai-Restaurant,Thai,4,?11-20,4,9/27/16,"Really original and GOOD Thai food. Not just the ordinary Thai recipes one finds everywhere. Just try anything that calls your attention. Everything is fresh, tasty and well prepared."
Dokmai Thai-Restaurant,Thai,4,?11-20,5,11/12/10,"This Thai restaurant really has a Thai cook and even offers to cook any Thai dish upon request. Prices are mid-range, the place is quite small so make reservations in advance."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,4/19/15,"This place is pretty darn good. I'm not used to the whole Thai/Viet/Japa fusion under one roof, but I ain't mad at eaaaat.The Tom Yam Gung was really good, broth was tangy and spicy and the shrimp size-able. For an entree I had the phat thai with krispy duck, tasty noodles and krispy duck, can you go wrong? Also, dammmmn good.Service was fine and they had all of the fixins I love, chili paste, thai chilies in fish sawce.I have a feeling my Berliner friends will be back. Get your Thai/Viet/Japa fusion tha fuk on!"
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,11/13/17,"I went because the reviews were great and tried the thai dishes , they were just plain bad the soyp was too heavy and the phad thai were just plain stir fried noodles ... maybe the sushi is much better , it was full and the service was pretty good"
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,5/6/16,"Thank you german users of yelp for showing me my new favorite place! If it hadn't been for yelp, I would never had known this place existed. We were kind of sceptical (the sushi in Denmark is way more expensive) because of the cheap sushi but the place had nice reviews so we gave it a try. The host was amazing and kind, I felt like home even though we had a bit of communication problems. Spring rolls were great and sushi was soooo good. I'm still full but thinking about coming back tomorrow for lunch."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,5/6/16,"The food was really good, the portion was big and it was not expensive, 7.20 euro maximm for the Ente kross plates.The lassi wasn't that good.  Also the staff are very friendly.I will visit it again for sure."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,6/29/16,"We started with spring rolls, which were great. We had green curry duck. Wonderful. Shrimp tempura inside out roll was great along with the inside out tuna roll. At the end, they gave us some little drink that tasted like honey. Not sure what it was but I loved it. Great meal. We will be going back soon."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,4/29/16,"This is my go-to place for green curry. Really it's my go-to place for when I want a plate of fried pork with lots of veggies. Also, if I want a freshly blended mango lassi instead of a pre-made one.I always order the same dish and haven't been disappointed yet. They must also have their kitchen set up well because I've rarely waited more than fifteen minutes for my food.The portions are large, not taking the price (~?6) into consideration AND they have a menu of larger portions available.The owners are very sweet and wait in tables themselves. There's plenty of seating, especially in summer."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,7/27/15,"Excellent food and very nice staff. Our waiter got half of our order wrong, but he was so nice and apologetic so it didn't matter at all. We also got a complimentary shot of plum wine. The crispy duck was very crispy and very tasty. Fried glass noodles with beef was great too.The prices was almost ridiculously low compared to how good the food was."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,1,7/17/15,"We ordered a few dishes and everything tastes more or less the same, which feels gross. It seems they just cooked everything with overdose of oil, salt and sugar. It is rather like cheap fast chain asian food. Too bad..."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,5/19/13,Best Tom Yam Gung I have ever had!!  Green curry with baked redfish was also delicious.  The comments about the portion sizes is certainly true.   I was very hungry and still had trouble finishing it.  (I can't imagine the large hunger portions they mention!).  Worth the walk wen your hungry... Even when you pass by all kinds of other shops.  A+++!!!
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,11/2/11,"14.00 clock. Visit to the KOY. Alone with my colleague and the waitress, the rest of the restaurant looks abandoned. The interior times before I leave the outside, but it's all very colorful. The same goes for food, which was finished in 6 minutes on the table. Twice-baked chicken. Green curry sauce. Of rice. Vegetable. The map is available, all vegetables are fresh. Hmmm. Was freshly prepared it for sure, but it was also frozen foods. Except for the elaborately carved carrot. The rice was on the point and very tasty, and the green curry sauce was (unfortunately) much too thin, my Ginger Ale had more consistency. Taste not so good really. The chicken I gave back into the kitchen, which was not chew namely to enjoy yet. Rubber does not describe it adequately. Twice baked I know differently. And above all, much much better. Kudos for mango milkshake."
Koy,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,11/29/09,"A Thai that also has a Vietnamese and sushi menu. Ok, well, let's judge not too fast, shall we?We ordered a Tom Ka Kai and two main dishes. A red curry with shrimps and a broccoli dish with tofu.Unfortunately, we didn't really (really didn't) like it. All the dishes were very sweet, and also a bit on the salty side. Because of the sweetness both the soup and the curry almost tasted like a sweet & sour Chinese dish!Service was nice, place looks ok as well, but for a real thai experience you'd better look elsewhere.Update: tried it again because of all the good reviews. Still didn't like the food: it's like they add 5 spoons of sugar to every dish. Well, I guess some like that. I prefer the authentic Thai kitchen though, not this Germanized version."

Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/22/14,"The food was excellent!  The chicken sate, pad Thai, garlic chicken, chicken with mixed vegetables and cashews were all delicious!  Prices are reasonable and they offer an English menu.  All I can say is yum!"
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/15/14,"Came here for lunch today and fell in love. The atmosphere is sweet and decor is unique. Once you order up front, the food comes almost instantaneously. I ordered #114 baked fish with veggies and ginger soy--it was absolutely fantastic in taste. I would eat it again for dinner just to be gluttonous."
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,4,5/25/13,"This is a pretty decent Thai place in Berlin. I was craving pad see ew and was worried I wouldn't be able to find it, but they had an English menu so I could easily figure it out (flat rice noodles). The food itself was good with ample portions, though I wish I had known they had pepper flakes before smothering the dish in chili paste.The ambiance is very cute, especially the downstairs. Note that you have to order at the counter and they'll call you by your order number. Prices are reasonable as well."
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,4,12/4/11,"Reviewing Berlin restaurants, as well as finding them, poses the following problem: there are about a million of them, and 900,000 of these are basically one of maybe four types.  Thus, wandering around on Bergmanstr is a somewhat confusing proposition for most dining purposes.That said, this particular Thai takeout is really good, and, if you're in the area, highly recommended.  Good for either eating there (there's additional space downstairs) or takeout (but make sure to add pepper or fish sauce if you need it before you go), the food is freshly made and tasty.  This is definitely one you'll keep coming back to."
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/9/14,"Insanely delicious - every time I tell myself I'm going to try something new and every time I get the crispy duck green curry, it's just that good. Love the open kitchen and even when it's hectic your food will be ready in five minutes. The little pots of sauces you can spoon on the side are perfect; the chili paste has a great flavor but isn't very spicy, the soy-like sauce with bird's eye chilis brings the spice level way up. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area!"
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,5,7/2/13,Authentic Thai food - prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is young and fun! Try the beef salad and the tom yum kung!

Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,4,7/28/08,I had lunch here today and have to say this was the best Thai I have tried in Berlin. The food was great. I just have a vegetable green curry but it was incredibly good.
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,3,10/8/09,Good Thai Food but too crowded and too expensive for Berlin. Nice for lunch though
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,4,7/30/08,better than average thai food. note: you order at the counter and pick up your food when it's ready. this isn't a place where you should plan to spend a lot of time.
Pagode Thai Kitchen,Thai,4,?11-20,5,7/29/11,best thai in berlin. no chance of finding better food anywhere else :) i love it and you will too haha (what a slogan :))
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,9/19/17,"We ordered Korean BBQ, and it was amazing! Combination of rice with BBQ made us happier than anything else. We missed Rei-men (cold-noodle), which is best to eat together with meats, but it's still trivial."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,1/19/17,"I came here with a group of people for dinner, the restaurant was much bigger than I expected. there were seats for people prefer lower table, really nice idea. Soon we sat down, the service came along and gave as the menu. We already did decided waht to order before we got to this place, but I still had a quick look. it seems like there are many options amd the price is also a bit higher, but still acceptable. I saw there also have special lunch offer. probably will try some of them next time. This time we just stay with the BBQ meal.We ordered the bbq beef which not spicy. the staff got everything ready and then just cooked it for us on our table, at the same time he explained how we should eat it, in order to tasted it right way. Basically, we shouldn't mix the food. meats first and rice later or the other way around. personaly, I prefer the taste when it mix together. I did treid the way he told as first. The meal was great, we all like it a lot. The staff were really nice, they gave us some more side dishes when we finished our first around.  For extra rice they will charge it though. Overall, I think this is one of the cool Korean restaurants to have some nice food."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,5/29/17,"Let's start right of the bat!Kimchi Princess is a korean restaurant located in Kreuzberg.I went there to celebrate the korean teachers day with the ""Koreanisches Kulturzentrum"".And at the first glance I was suprised by its dim red light. It gave off a different vibe, really special.So, to continue, the staff was really nice, just how you would expect to be treated, nothing extraordinary. But now, let's get to the food. To be honest, it was a pain to wait so long for the food. But it's understandable by the huge amount of guests they have. The portion size was like in any other korean restaurant I visited, pretty large, but worth it's price. The food was really tasty, of course I chose the   (korean pork). We ordered a whole menu, so there was really much food. So, you also have to know that there are 2 etages, Unfortunately I sat in the first floor, but it wasn't all that bad. The table ,I sat at ,was really long! So all in all, I would give it 4 stars, cause it's a solid restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food served for an understandable price. It just didn't have that certain indefinable something.But even so, it's recommendable Enjoy your stay!I hope I could help you out"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,3/16/17,"I was here for lunch earlier, as I was meeting a friend. It's a modern Korean restaurant, as far as I can see. More hip than traditional. That said, I think they passed my stone pot bibimbap test.See, every time I visit a Korean restaurant for the first time, chances are I would order a bibimbap, and if they have it, a dolsot bibimbap. This place had a dolsot bibimbap, so of course I got it. For lunch, you can combine it with a small miso soup and a drink, as a set menu, for 10.00 EUR. Not bad in my opinion.I took the vegetarian version, mostly because I felt like I just had too much meat lately. And I must say that their offering is great! It is definitely something repeatable. But perhaps I'll go somewhere else for dinner, as I know there are plenty of other good Korean dishes out there and this place tends to stay within the less adventurous ones. (There is this one place in Friedenau for example who has a Korean-only page in their menu, which lists all these traditional dishes that they think only Koreans would order, but I digress...)One thing I didn't see here, is a dolsot yukhoe bibimbap. Perhaps that's already too exotic for these folks. Anyway, long story short, this place is better for lunch, and it is amazing for such, but go somewhere else for a more traditional Korean experience."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,6/25/17,"We love to come here. English speaking personnel, very delicious and authentic Korean food."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,4/6/17,"Made reservation for a Tuesday evening and took a friend for my birthday dinner. Arrived at 6:30pm, table was ready and hardly any guests there, perfect. Starters, steamed beef Mandu and for the main dish, GALBI ROS GUI, entrecote bbq beef.The Mandu were awesome, we should have ordered 3 of 'em. and then the entrecote arrived, oh my! Waiter was very friendly and even explained how to eat it, the side dishes, garnishes were equally stunning and delicious. This is something one could eat all night and not get full.I have to go back and try the rest of the menu. Sure, it is not on the cheap side, but you get what you pay for, and it's well worth it. PS: If the place is really crowded the smell is getting bad, due to the many table- side grills, so get there early!"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,9/1/17,"This place was so awesome. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating and they have all the classics plus clearly marked vegetarian and vegan variations of a lot of things. The atmosphere is interesting and relaxed. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and the street itself is removed far enough from main traffic avenues that sitting outside isn't unbearably loud. I will definitely return and recommend to friends!"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,3,12/21/16,"Quite overhyped place. The lunch menu (until 6pm) is limited, and 5-6 dishes we tried weren't great. If you want the best bibimpap, you're better off at Cooking Papa."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,2,7/15/16,"Disappointed!!! The service is so slow because they're clearly understaffed. My friend and I got the samgyeopsal BBQ. It was overpriced and kept sticking to the grill. The meat and grill were obviously bad quality. The banchan was semi fresh but the kimchi was pretty bad. It was also ridiculously expensive for no good reason. However, we got soju cocktails and they were tasty! The freshest thing was the lettuce they gave us for our BBQ.I definitely won't go back because I can get a much better deal elsewhere."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,3,8/3/15,"The past week I've been craving dumplings, so I figured a visit to Kimchi Princess was in order, considering it's so near and I'd never been. We arrived around 4 or 5pm on a Sunday, which was perfect for getting a prime pick of seating. I didn't actually go inside so I don't know what that's like, but the outdoor seating is plentiful and in a covered area.Kimchi Princess has a lunch menu, which is a pick of an entree that comes with miso soup and a soft drink for less than ?10. It's good until 6pm every day, so it's definitely the way to go. I got the vegan bibimbap and the fellow got the vegetarian one, and we also split an order of dumplings.The miso was unspectacular, but the dumplings were good, though they brought them out 5-10 minutes after the entrees, which I found a bit strange. The bibimbap was also tasty and the presentation was nice. However, though I am no expert on Korean food at all, only having had it once before, I didn't think the bibimbap was as flavorful or exciting as it could have been. The hot sauce had a nice flavor and wasn't too hot, but I definitely had to add soy sauce to the meal. I also think I would have liked more kimchi in the bowl, and tofu with some kind of marinade (maybe fried in soy sauce?) would have made it tastier. The crunchy-ish rice at the bottom of the bowl was awesome though; if you get the bibimbap, definitely get it cooked in the hot stone bowl.I am sure I will be back here at some point for ""lunch,"" as it really is a good, healthy, relatively affordable meal. But I also want to try out other Korean spots in town, because I have a feeling (and have been told) that there are more authentic and less expensive bibimbaps to be had."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,8/14/15,"How much cheaper are the other Korean restaurants in Berlin? After reading the Yelp reviews, I expected Kimchi Princess to be outrageously expensive. But compared to Korean restaurant prices in California and in Washington D.C., I thought that there was no price differential to complain about. The ambiance reminded me of pojangmachas in Korea, which are small tented restaurants that symbolize the street food of Korea. The drinks menu is awesome, as the restaurant has a full bar and can whip up nice cocktails in addition to soju and makgeolli (Korean creamy rice liquor). I came here with my dad and he ordered a Mr. Park, which is also his surname. He was quite amused. We shared the seafood pancake and the bulgogi on the grill. I prefer my seafood pancake to be thin and with a caramelization on the top, forming a nice crust. But Kimchi Princess prepared its dish half an inch thick, more like an omelette than a traditional Korean pancake. However, the bulgogi was marinated perfectly, hitting the right balance of sweet and salty, and was quite tender. I would come back for the bulgogi and more of the Mr. Park cocktails!"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,2,10/2/16,"The positives first: the interior is hip, the staff nice, the atmosphere is cool. The bbq dishes are expensive but the portions are more than enough. The marinated meat dishes are too sweet for my taste but overall okay. But, coming from someone who grew up on Korean food and lived in Seoul for four years: if I closed my eyes while eating the sundubu jiggae - spicy tofu stew~ I wouldn't even recognize that I'm eating a Korean dish let alone which one. Same goes for the seafood pancakes etc. the food is not bad~ but they just don't taste like they are supposed to at all. And kimchi princess is not intending to be a fusion restaurant."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,4/5/16,"I absolutely love kimchi princess and used to love going there when I lived in Berlin!Atmosphere: amazing:) i love the design, maybe a bit too dark but certainly fun.Food: i love it! The korean bbq is extremely tasty and proper portions. Their bibimbap is also very yummy. Their kimchi is absolutely recommendable:) green tea tiramisu also a must.Cant wait to return!"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,2/12/17,"I've been here twice, and don't understand the negative reviews.  OF COURSE if you lived in Korea - this probably isn't as good.  Get over it, really.  What it is, is good, well-priced, fast Korean in Germany.  We liked the kimchi pancake, beef bim, and especially the spicy short ribs.  Service was very good and fast."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,2,9/8/16,"You dont need a hipster princess, when you want decent Korean food!The Kimchi Princess is not one of the best places in Berlin, but def one of the most popular ones, so as a foodie sooner or later you will have to go there.We went there in a group of ten and of course booked a table because otherwise it's hard to even get a table for two people. The outside area is alright to sit, the inside has industrial charme and is really smelly from all the sizzling BBQ grills after a while.The waiter, who didnt speak German, was friendly but it took a long while until the drinks came.We ordered different starters such as Pajeon and Dumplings which were alright but no sensation. I've def had better Pajeon at Gogogi in Kastanienallee. As a main we had the regular beef BBQ and the beef and octopus BBQ. It came with a bowl of rice and several microscopic little servings of sides. What annoys me is that you only get one serving of sides per two servings of meat. That doesn't make sense to me. After asking for more sides the waiter was friendly and promised to come back with more but never did. Additional orders of drinks we forgotten as well and had to be requested three times before we finally got more drinks.The meat itself was tender and soft and it's def a nice experience to have it grilled directly at your table. There was hardly any octopus in the beef & octopus serving which was disappointing and a friend of mine who has been here before noticed that the portions became smaller.That all wouldn't be as annoying if you weren't paying a solid 18-20? per serving of BBQ.Sum up: It's an overpriced, overrated hipster place with overworked and uncoordinated service. I am not coming back as long as there is other Koreans in town."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,3,1/1/15,"I liked the ambiance and the friendly, quick, service, but alas the food was actually below average.Tip: Avoid the pajeon/pancakes at all costKimchi pancake - There was barely any kimchi in it, or else it did not impart in this pancake.--All I could taste was pancake. The dipping sauce made it better.Seafood Pancake - no seafood flavor-- all I could taste was egg- next to us two girls from South Korea ordered the same thing and they left half of their pancake.Banchan (side dishes) were pretty bland in general - the kimchi didn't have the punchy flavors I was accustomed to,Samgyoepsal (pork belly)- pretty good, came with some atypical spicy cabbage slaw and lettuceBulgogi - swimming in the marinating liquid, very flavorful.Overall it was an okay meal -- yes it is pretty pricey, especially the sangyoepsal which is considered to be the party meal of choice for poor students in South Korea. But hey, if they can get Germans (especially the older, wealthier clientele dotted throughout the restaurant) to pay for it, more power to them."
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,4,10/17/16,We have been to Kimchi Princess four times during three years and liked it every time. My boyfriend loves their bibimbap. I tried the veggie bibimbap and a few other dishes which I really liked. The staff is friendly. Yesterday we visited with  a baby and a pram which was no problem. Will definitely be coming back.
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,2,10/11/15,"Really disappointed. 23euro for Ros Gui, which is thin sliced ribeye, just doesnt make sense. They sell it as Kalbi Ros Gui, but thats not really galbi, not the one you'd expect from korea or staples in US in LA or NYC. Meat was not really fresh. There were some brown patches on the meat indicating oxidation. Again, 23euro for subpar meat is just wrong. Also ordered mul mandoo for the table. Mandoos were hard and a bit stale on the sides. Tasted like it was frozen for a while. Really wanted to like kimchi princess, but overall just really disappointed. Oh also, they charge extra for banchan... come on man, foreal?"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,8/1/15,"The best!!!! Food was incredible and the service was literally some of the best I've ever had in berlin. I reserved a table and menu for our group of nine and everyone left absolutely stuffed and happy.The cocktails were creative and bursting with fresh ingredients (only critique is that I wish they were just a bit stronger). We got one of the BBQ menus and loved everything, especially the fried veggies in the beginning + the marinated beef. The chicken and vegetarian options we ordered were pretty spicy, which I was fine with, but maybe some people probably wouldn't enjoy. To keep it short and sweet, I would love to come back and would recommend kimchi princess for large groups!"
Kimchi Princess,Korean,3.5,?21-40,5,10/10/14,"Had the samgyeopsal BBQ and it was simply delightful, very friendly staff (we even got drinks on the house because we had to wait for our table), not that cheap but totally worth every cent!"
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/24/16,"One of my favorite Thai places I've been in Europe. The place smells nice and fragrant. I had the prawn spring rolls, the rice paper was a bit tough but the sauces were really nice. My friends had green and red curries  which were also very tasty. I had the pad thai, quite spicy and very delicious. I don't know that much about the Thai kitchen, but I would definitely recommend this place."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,7/31/17,"After walking past here many times and wondering if I should try it, hoping it would be more authentic than other Asian restaurants I'd tried in the area, we finally tried it -- but were quite disappointed. Not authentic Thai at all (from what we tried). All looks like they would be, and they even have Thai beers, but no, it's still the same bland Asian fusion mix that seems to be the standard in Berlin for many Asian restaurants. Food was still tasty -- but just not authentic (which is what I was hoping for)."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,5/21/17,"great food. small portions. TERRIBLE service. there was only one guy working the entire place. he was hustling, but it definitely took at least 45 minutes to get my food. there was a table of 4 sitting next to me and they brought out one persons main dish at least 15 minutes before bringing everyone else's."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,6/14/17,Typical German style Thai restaurant where the Panang sauce is served like a soup rather than a thick curry like it is in Thailand.  It was tasty enough but way too sweet.  The guests around me had a variety of other dishes but they all looked exactly the same with the reddish color soup drowning out the rice.
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,6/13/16,"Our food was tasty, there's no doubt there!But (there are several 'buts', unfortunately) it contained really big sloppily chopped slices of unpeeled ginger, which were not very pleasant to bite on. The amount of meat was not very generous, to say the least... And when I asked for less ice in my drink (which was basically all ice cubes), the waiter rolled his eyes at me and afterwards slapped the new drink back on the table with a demonstratively loud thump and no words. A table that was very sticky, by the way. All in all, three stars are generous."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/17/16,"The Pad Thai, Masaman Curry, and Tom Ka.... soooo good, especially so for Berlin! I was pleasantly surprised upon discovering that I can get Thai food up to San Francisco standards here in Berlin! I can't tell if its a blessing or a curse having grown up in a city with such amazingggg foooooodddddd."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,2/29/16,"Delicious food at a good price with friendly service. We had the chicken satay and shrimp spring rolls for starters, the duck phad grapau and the chicken gaeng panaeng curry for main dishes and lemongrass and ginger teas to drink. All of the flavors were delicious and the phad grapau had great heat. Will definitely come back."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,2,8/12/15,"Perfect location, but they failed to bring here Thailand to Berlin. In addition to the Thai beer.Menu unreadable, it's hard to make any decisions.Large plates, lots of vegetables, and I ask where is the meat ?! I'm not a typical meat lover, but even for me serving chicken with vegetables and rice should contain more than 7 scraps of meat.Once, by accident and never again."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,1/2/17,I live in the area and can't recommend this place highly enough.. it's relatively cheap (?8) for a main and you get a good portion.. I would definitely recommend trying the red curry with fried chicken! Staff are nice and there's a nice atmosphere in the restaurant.
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,2/2/16,"The food is delicious. Lemongrass pad thai is something I crave. But the portions are small and they have screwed up orders one too many times. My husband swears we will never eat there again. Meanwhile, I wish I didn't love their pad thai as much as I do."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,9/11/16,"I set inside and there you would see the old lady while cooking your food, I usually like that. The food wasn't late, it was very tasty and a quite big portion. I can agree with the other comments that the meet (prawn in my case) aren't enough in the plate."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,10/13/14,"The best Thai food I have had in Berlin so far!  I just ate here last weekend and enjoyed a large plate of pad see ew and my husband had the surprisingly spicy drunken noodles.  Finally a Thai restaurant that hasn't abandoned all spices and chillies to please the Germans!!We weren't hungry enough to order any ""finger foods"" but they sounded good from the menu and were quite cheap.  Our entrees were around 8? each - pretty cheap for good Asian food in a popular area. The service was a bit slow but it was very busy at the time.  I did appreciate that they boxed up our leftovers for us to take home because the portions were quite large!  I will definitely be going back."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,3,1/1/16,"One of the few decent places to eat in Berlin. Friendly staff, decent atmosphere. If only there wasn't mutiple strands of hair it wouldn't be half bad."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,7/13/15,"Wife and kids are Thai and we loved it. Price, quality and service all great. A bit crowded, so get there early. Will be back again, for sure."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,7/18/13,"A tasty Thai place. The noodles aren't too greasy and the chicken is ample and recognizable as chicken you'd want to eat. Some of the dishes could use a bit more spice (pad si-iew, I'm looking at you!) but at 6 - 8 EUR for mains it's not going to make you regret not just grabbing noodles at the U-Bahn station."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,11/27/14,Currently visiting Berlin and found this place by chance. We got take out to bring back to the apartment and it was the tastiest Thai we've ever eaten. The pad Thai and the Masaman Duck was to die for and very reasonable at 6-8 Euro a head. We will be back before our visit is over.
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/12/14,"Really nice restaurant, good food and really tasty pad Thai noodles, many types of peppers (which I just love) and fortune cookies for dessert on the way out..."
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,7/5/15,My favorite Asian restaurant in Berlin! Grandma is the best!
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,2/5/14,"Amazing food, reasonable prices and plenty of options to choose from. Loved it!"
Lemongrass,Thai,4,?11-20,5,1/14/11,"This place is crowded in the summer so it's tough to get a spot outside where you definitely want to be. Once you're sitting out there you'll want to stay hours drinking and watching the people walking by at night. The staff or maybe the owners, I don't know, are eager to please.The three times I ate here I always had the lemongrass chicken salad. It was so good and fresh tasting that I just kept getting that. I love cilantro and this had good fresh cilantro. That fish-sauce stuff was good also but I don't think you can mess that up.This area is where my hotel was so it was great to have this place nearby. Even when they're crowded the food comes very fast which is great when you show-up starving."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/26/17,"You would think the best food in Berlin would be German food, right? Welp, surprisingly, it's Vietnamese food. Who would have guessed?....Chay Viet is one of the best Viet places I've ever been to. Better than any Viet restaurant in America in California or Florida, trust me on this one. They have a very wide selection of different dishes, some that will surprise you. The interesting thing is that everything on the menu is vegetarian. If you're someone who fears the veggie, don't fret. Out of the dishes I tried, everything is completely edible, very wholesome, and delicious! They create the perfect harmony between making their food rich in flavor, but light enough where it still doesn't overpower you. Everything also comes in a pretty large portion too. I would suggest getting the Mi Quang - my favorite hands down. I would HIGHLY recommend stopping by here if you're in Berlin!"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,10/26/16,"Great little place that stumbled upon in the Mitte while looking for an alternative for Rou. You know a vietnamese restaurant with a kitchen that was actually open for dinner.The wanton soup had fried dumplings instead of boiled which surprised me. The taste was great, but the soup was so oily as a result. You can see the layer of oil circling in the soup. If that's the secret to great taste, then sign me up.For my entree, I had ca bung, an eggplant tofu dish with tumeric and plaintains. Never had anything like this before. Most of the vegetarian vietnamese restaurants in Houston focus on meat analogs so I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted good but the dish played havoc on the digestive system later with the gas. It could have been the oily soup instead but I blame the novel dish with the soybeans."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,11/13/17,"Pretty good curry , i've had better in Berlin , but its a very good vegetarian option everything was well prepared , the tofu was really good and the vegetables fresh ,  and crispy , really tasty curry"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/25/16,"It's the second time that I give a restaurant five stars. The best vegetarian food that I've ever had in my life. So good. Tasty, a lot of options, healthy, good ambience, large portion, cheap, good service. It's just fantastic! I'm staying in Berlin for six days and I've been here three times.  Food I've tried which I'll definitely recommend:17: Rice noodles with curry, coconut milk, vegetables and tofu18: Fried glass noodles with tasty marinated tofu, various fungi to selected Vietnamese herbs21: Traditional medium Vietnamese soup with rice noodles and tofu, mushrooms, flavoured with coconut milk.31: Vietnamese Bim Bap with caramelised tofu, oyster mushrooms, vegetables with rice and a fried egg on top35: Dessert!! Sticky rice and pumpkin fritters candied with coconut cream and sesame.The shakes are also yummy!I especially love the 124 with fresh kiwi, milk and green tea.My boyfriend ordered the 126 shake with cucumber, milk, yoghurt and salty lime, which I don't like but is very interesting. I'll miss the restaurant and I'll definitely visit it again if I come back to Berlin."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,8/15/16,"A companion and I settled for this one for dinner tonight. We wanted to try something new, so we headed here and grabbed a table.The menu is large, and yes, they are a vegetarian restaurant. We shared the Vietnamese pancake, and I got the Vietnamese bibimbap (at least that's how they explained it in the menu, a variety of things including a fried egg, piled on top of rice). The portions were huge here, and everything tasted great and filling that I would echo a previous reviewer and say that we barely noticed that it was vegetarian. I also liked the mango lassi, it was thick and quite flavorful.One thing I don't like is that they seem to rely on tofu too much. I think 99 percent of their menu has tofu in it. Just because they are vegetarian doesn't mean that they have to rely on tofu for everything! While I have nothing against tofu, I find this a very problematic issue for people who have issues against protein. And I am sure one can be more creative and concoct dishes that don't always have to call for a meat substitute."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,7/17/17,"Amongst the most delicious, satisfying, creative meals I've ever enjoyed! Their dishes are as skillfully prepared and authentic as the best Vietnamese meals I had in Vietnam, and the diversity of flavors and textures is remarkable for a vegetarian restaurant. However, the service is embarrassing, even for Germany! Do not come here if you are in a rush, or offended when people who arrive after you are served their food before you're even allowed to place your order. I'll still be back for a very leisurely meal!"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,4/17/16,"Nice vegetarian restaurant near the subway station Bernauer Stra?e. If you are around there, I would advice to go to that place. It's not a very special restaurant but quality and cost effectiveness are in apple-pie order. Particulary convincing was the homemade lemonade which is called ""Chia Sensation"". The raspberries were out of stock but nevertheless a very good choice. And you can feel the healthiness by drinking the sour lemonade with the chia seeds which make you feel lively. You should try it! To cut the  manner further short: The staff was very friendly and helpful when I asked about her recommendation. Whereby I ordered the filled tofu in a clay pot which was served with fresh broccoli and string beans. And also spring rolls. They were ok but I already had much better ones. A bit too squashy for my taste. I liked the main dish better, it was not a standard vietnamese dish and tasted interesting. Relaxed atmosphere, sprinkling piano music in the background and nice food!And you can pay without Cash, soo convenient! Special point for that!"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/6/16,Huge restaurant with great classical asian music playing (piano music mostly). We stayed there for hours and talked over the great food there. The portions were good and the prices were reasonable. We got beers and pho and just shared with everyone. Great vibe. Everything tasted great and we barely noticed that it was vegetarian haha
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/20/14,I walked to this place once when I was close to starvation. It took me quite a while to get there because my university is a bit far away. So anyway it was totally worth it! I was craving for some Thai curry and they served me a good one! The service is very kind and the food comes really quick! Boom baby!
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,8/3/14,"Chay Viet is one of the better-valued vegetarian options in Mitte.  An all-vegetarian menu without a bump up in prices.  It doesn't hurt that the food's good, too.  It won't blow your mind, but I haven't had anything dissapointing there.  Note: often heavily populated by cultish vegan Jivamukti Yoga participants from across the street."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/16/14,"Enjoyed by our entire party (all but one are carnivores) so I can safely assume the restaurant is good for non-vegetarians as well. From a vegetarian point of view it has a wide variety of foods, enough to have that fun dish exchange done over the table. Tip: the Vietnamese cuisine is very spicy and slightly different than other Asian cuisines - I recommend you try it with all my heart but it doesn't suit everyone."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/13/15,"Best veggie food in Berlin so far... but we'll, I've only been here a couple of days."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/20/15,"This is an outstanding restaurant. We have never ever been disappointed.  The service can be a little slow sometimes, but good things come to those who wait.  The food is delicious and I had never had tofu that was so tastefully flavored. We go to this restaurant almost every other week, sometimes even every week. We whole heartedly recommend this place."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/11/15,"Food is excellent. A very good choice of vegan and vegetarian dishes....no meat in this place! The personal are friendly and very helpful. I mistakenly pointed to another dish, while ordering my favourite Kho and was disappointed when I didn't get it. When I complained my plate was taken away and the right dish was brought to me without a problem and at no extra cost. That is what I call customer service! If I could give 10 stars, I would......a must try for everyone"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/2/15,Awesome food! Friendly staff. Tomato tofu is great. The banana sesame lassi is also wonderful. Also - free wifi is much appreciated.
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/17/15,"Chay Viet is not your typical vietnamese place. They only offer vegetarian dishes, but the quality of the food is outstanding. The selection of different dishes is great and covers all the great vietnamese dishes like soups, salads and curries. Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. A must if you like vietnamese cuisine. This is as good as it gets in vegetarian viet cuisine."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,10/5/13,"The only place we went to twice on our visit to Berlin! We had a lovely dinner and a nice afternoon snack here -- I had the Pho (I was feeling a little under the weather) and my hubs loved the clay pot. The tea was lovely, and it's a big space, no issue coming with our group at all. They do have an english menu, but if you're familiar with Vietnamese fare, you wouldn't even need it. Nice place and very vegan friendly!"
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,2/4/16,Best vegetarian vietnamese place I've ever been. I'm eating there almost every week since 2 years.
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,3,3/1/14,"Great food, lots of space to sit, good prices, large portions. Would I go again, probably if it was a larger party of people but not to take someone for a great eat place."
Chay Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/5/12,"Woke up from a nap fairly hungry, so we waltzed on over for dinner on the way to the grocery store. I ordered the #17 Pho Cary, and when it arrived, I thought""well, lots of leftovers"". There were no leftovers. Every bite was perfectly prepared, well balanced, exploding with flavors, and I can't wait to go again."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,9/30/17,The food came out quick and was delicious. The staff here are very attentive and speedy. The presentation of the food was also beautiful. This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat!
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,1/21/18,"Great food, nice staff and good prices. A bit uncomfortable chairs if I had to point my fingers at something  (but really nothing)."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,11/30/17,Service was great and the food came out quickly. The noodle dish was underwhelming...lacking flavor. The shrimp skewer was pretty good as was the fresh spring roll. The best thing was the crispy duck. Get it - get two - you will not be disappointed.
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,5/15/16,"It was not the first time we were here. It's definitely also not the last time. We love coming here and ordering a bunch of their ""small dishes"" to share. All the dishes are freshly made, served on a bed of salad and a specialty sauce. ""Traumhaft"", as they say around here"
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,12/2/16,"Great service- very friendly staff! I was not a huge fan of the Pho I ordered (basic chicken broth with herbs and sprouts), but friends ordered s spicy Pho and a curry dish that were both amazing! Very busy on the weekends (good sign!), waiter said Mondays are the slowest nights, FYI."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,2/14/17,"Excellent. Everything is fresh and full of complex, complimentary flavors and spices. Some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had. Even the tea selection is vast and creative. Highly recommended."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,2/26/17,"Super fresh food, a culinary experience at a cheap price. Fresh exciting drinks and super tasty food. Ate here 3 days in a row with my family, easy to find."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/31/16,"Went there with some friends today. We ordered 3 of the daily main course specials (chicken curry, duck and squid salad) plus the shrimp salad with glas noodles and some ""Kleinigkeiten"" (Summer rolls, papaya salad, crispy shrimp rolls). Everything was BEYOND delishes. You have to try the small papaya salad, the chicken curry and the squid salad. Loved the sauce they served with the summer rolls (if you ask you can get more of it plus a whole rack with more sauces and spices). Their veggies are super fresh and crisp.My fav Asian restaurant in this area so far. Will be back soon!!"
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,5/9/16,"Very good place with delicious Asian tapas, if you can call it that. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable for the area. Have not yet tried any of their main dishes, but would guess that they are equally good. Not 5 stars just because some other Asian places in the area deliver similar quality."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,4/24/14,"We were here for a late dinner yesterday, wanting to try out a new restaurant. So we tried this one, which I have to say, was an experience with good and not so good items. Let me start with what I like. I like the design of their menu. Most restaurants (even those serving non-Western cuisine) follow a Western format, beginning with appetizers, a huge main dish section, and some desserts. Saigon Green doesn't follow that. Instead, they have just a few main dishes, and the bulk of the menu are these small appetizers (Vietnamese-style tapas, so to speak). So what we did last night was order 5 of those for two people, plus drinks. Of those 5 dishes, most were very palatable. I loved the very spicy papaya salad, as well as the chicken and vegetable salad and the shrimp fritters. However, what I didn't like were the dishes that I thought were the staple of every Vietnamese restaurant. Their spring rolls were too dry; yes, there was sauce provided, but I should say it was not enough to mitigate the dryness of the wrapper and the vegetables inside. Also, their bunh bao had too much dough in it. What's supposed to be a steamed rice mini-bread with meat filling turned out to be just steamed rice mini-bread. I should say I have had better bunh bao elsewhere, notably in that restaurant sharing a part of their name near G?rlitzer Bahnhof.So, overall, I am giving this place 3 stars. They had good things that doesn't make me want to not come back here again, but they also had not-so-good things that makes me want to continue and search for other better Vietnamese places."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,6/16/15,"For once I don't mind sharing my foodTbh I was pretty stuffed before I came in here. That's what a week long wurst fest does to you. She doesn't like to eat alone and I was just being polite really :-( So looking down at my bulging belly then glancing at the menu I had to make a decision. So I plumped for 3 small plates, secretly hoping she would share most of it.This is a busy place, but most Vietnamese places are busy in this area and Kant Stra?e is Asian food central. My curried chicken, satay chicken and Vietnamese rolls were pretty good and a little too much even for a hungry person. So she tucked in too, nibbling away between gulps of roast duck and rice. I'm glad I came now, but I think breakfast will be given a wide swerve :-S"
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,6/13/15,"Went here for dinner. Very fresh food, super tasty appetisers . I got duck rolls , pork buns and shrimp wontons. Almost forgot , their tea selection is amazing! All fresh teas. And got a beef pho, just needed to add a little extra child to taste for me personally!"
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,10/28/16,Nice but too crowded. Same concept like many other similar restaurants. The sits are not very comfortable and the foods are average.
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,4/1/16,"The menu is promising here but unfortunately like some other Vietnamese places in Berlin the food is drowned in super sweet nuoc cham or hoisin sauce. I've given this place a few chances and don't understand the hype. Service staff is busy, good looking but not overly nice (typical berlin). Food looks nice with standard garnishes of ample nuts and lettuce-carrot mix, but there seems to be little respect for textures and tastes. I wish they would just put the stuff in separate dishes like in VN so we can season to taste."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,6/10/13,"Saigon Green is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in West Berlin. The food is awesome but the service is okay. After receiving five star service at Saigon and more, the service here cannot even begin to compare. They CHARGE you for TAP water. If you order more than one glass then they charge. I have never heard of this kind of nonsense before.To start, we tried the following spring rollsAutumn Rolls: Rice paper rolls with marinated beef, sesame salad, cucumbers, spring onions, rice noodles, and herbsLucky Rolls: Rice paper spring rolls with vegetables and plum chili noodles. These rolls are fried. I wish the description clearly stated this but they were still tasty.We tried the following Pho soups:Pho Bo: rice noodles with beef in broth, ginger, and green lemonBun Mang: Vietnamese rice noodle soup with spicy bamboo, tofu, chili, and gingerSup Mien Ga: Glass noodle soup with chicken broth, vegetables, sesame oil, chives and gingerSup Wan Tan: Homemade spicy soup with vegetables, classic wontons stuffed with shrimp and chicken, snow peas and herbsFor salad supplements, we tried the following:Goi Chay: Salad of fresh cabbage, tofu, red onions, celery, glass noodles, herbs and peanuts.Goi Mekong: Flavored spicy glass noodles with shrimp, vegetables, peanuts, sesame seeds, and herbs.I loved both sets of spring rolls. The Goi Mekong salad was the best. The shrimp was so fresh and the flavor was absolutely delightful. All four pho soups that we tried had their own unique and flavorful broths. The only one I did not like was the Bun Mang. The rice noodles in this soup were okay. I think the glass noodles in the Sup Mein Ga are much better. All of the dishes with glass noodles were phenomenal.Overall, the food here is authentic and certainly worth a visit!"
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,12/25/12,"Although food and presentation were fine at this trendy local spot, unfortunately we were totally ripped off here as tourists in September 2012.  When we questioned why we were charged 2 euros each for half a glass of water (when we ordered regular water), the waitress answered, ""on this street we can do it.""  Needless to say, we used her tip to cover the cost of the water and will make sure that no one from my corporation eats here."
Saigon Green,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,7/2/13,"Been there today as I wanted to compare this one to another one in the neighborhood (Saigon today). After my dinner I must say, they seem very much the same  however the food here is a little less interesting than the one in Wilmersdorfer strasse. The weather today was nice and sunny, so we choose to sit outside under the shades. Perfect. We choose some spicy chicken drum sticks as starters. They were very tasty, in a sweet fish sauce with some fresh herbs and a tiny salad on the side. As a Hauptgericht we choose two different soups: one with wantan and the other with thin slices of chicken breast. Both soups were tasty however not rich  which my companion would have liked and I found it to be nice in the hot weather. For drinks we choose one of Saigon greens freshly made lemonades (lemon + mint) with ice. Nicely done and also refreshing.Giving this place 3 stars. I would go for it if I came by  however I would not walk a long way just to get to this place. There are many other nice vietnamese restaurants around, and this one is much like the others."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,10/24/15,"After living in Taiwan for a while a few years ago, I always missed it's food and especially beef noodle soups. This is as close as it gets, in a very authentic small restaurant with great prices. If you want Taiwanese food, this is the place for you."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/5/17,"Listen up people. Shits about to get real. This place, Lon Mens, is a temple. A temple of flavour. Chilli wan tans, is what you need to order. Trust me. Now did you really think that with all this flavour, you wouldnt get some sort of attitude? Come on man, dont ever play yourself! The man of the house (lil older dude) had gotten a lil crankey over the years, so if you get treated like shit, dont trip - its part of the experience. Apart from that, and that this place is always packed, this is one of the greatest places everyone and no one knows about. If you reading this, then congratulations. You just got the bestest berlin tip ever my fren. They dont come often, and they usually aren't free. But ey, its ya lucky day. Now go pack your shit, go grab your wife and kids, leave the dog at home and get the fuck over there. Do something for your health, dont be a lonely man and come on down to Lon-Mens. Peace n love,Ya neighbour hood manPeng. C"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,10/11/17,"I was here earlier for dinner, and I must say I wasn't too impressed.We were early enough to not stand up and wait for a table. We ordered noodle soups and some dim sum as well as pig ears. Nothing life altering. Slightly overhyped even, I must say. The noodles were just okay, and I had better noodles before. Perhaps I am biased with ramen, but the noodles here had a flat uni-dimensional taste. And the dim sum and pig ears were also just ordinary.I know other Chinese places that have more interesting items on the menu. So I don't think I'd be back here again, unless this is the only open option.Oh, the air circulation inside could be improved."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/23/18,It was a pleasant surprise to find this very authentic Taiwanese noodle shop in Berlin.  My wife and I ordered the beef noodle soups and spicy wontons.  Both were very good.
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/16/17,"A literally hole on the wall place with every possible space inside turned into a custom seat. Still the place was packed. Authentic food, cheap price and friendly service converged here to make this happen."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,2/22/17,"We came because we heard this was the best dim sum joint in town -it was good, but not life altering. We had chicken soup, the combination dumplings, the house fried dumplings, and peanut sesame noodles. The soup was delicious and the star of the show -moist chicken and a flavorful Thai broth, the combination dumplings were good, but 5? for 4 small dumplings was steep. The house dumplings were very delicious -very flavorful. The price on these was a little better (10 dumplings for 8?) -but still quite expensive. The peanut sesame noodles were good -they were served a little tepid. I would've preferred them served hot, cold, or at least warm. Overall, the food was good, but expensive for the portions and I've had better. The customer service was great. We were seated and served quickly. The food was made fresh from the kitchen, viewable from the dining room."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/28/17,"Incredible fried dumplings and very tasty beef, duck and pork knuckle noodles. The restaurant is small and there are usually big lines but it is worth the wait. It is also very clean."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,10/19/17,"Not bad, not great. Portions of non soups small and a bit pricey. Not overly flavorful. Busy but fast and friendly service."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,3,5/18/16,"I read quite alot good review about this place before I actually got here. Although the Noodle House is facing the main steet, my partner and I did drove pass it. And have to check the house number to find the place. The shop is actually not so big. so better keep your eyes on their shop sign or the house number, if you on the way.I have been looking forward to pay a visit for quite a long time, until recently finally got the chance for this. So as soon as we sat down, we were just looking for something nice from the meun. Of course, I ordered noodle soups with beef and fried noodle with beed as well. The soup one I think was alright. Probably, because I knew some other great noodle soup places. I really like the Fired noodle, it tasted very fine and delicated. Also we order XiaoLong Dao as side dish. it tasted good as well, but the potion was just small for us.This place isn't self-service. It took a small while the staff came to us. The price of the place is great."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,4/11/17,"If looking for an Asian cuisine with attention to quality, it's a good place. Prices are reasonable. The space for guests is limited, but it matches the prices. (Google translator)"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,2/9/16,"Good taiwanese noodles place in Berlin. The beef brisket noodles ??? were good but the broth could be a bit more flavorful. The beef cut was so yummy tho!We also got xiaolongbao which was ok. The skins were a bit too thick but they arent a xiaolongbao ??? specialist so what we had was already acceptable. The dimsum combo (with hagaw ?? and siumai ??) was not that good though. Super cheap price and generous portion. Plus, super friendly service. The place is a bit small and might get a bit crowded during peak hours."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,11/27/16,"Delicious chilli dumplings, tasty noodle soups! Great prices and even if there is a line, it goes fast and is worth the wait! Heard about this place on vice channels ""chefs night out"" and since I'm obsessed with noodle soups, HAD to take a break from all the d?ner and come when I was visiting Berlin."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,1,10/3/16,"Visit Berlin hoping to get a nice experience of Taiwanese food. The man at the restaurant is so rude, I feel so silly even bothered going to his restaurant."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,1/18/17,A tiny place with usually long queue. But food is cheap and tasty. Their 'chilly oil dumpling' is must try.
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,4/9/16,"This was my 4th visit to Lon Men's and this time Dim Sum only. Nice sunny spring day and we were lucky to snatch a table outside. The duck bun should be listed as ""heavenly dream"". I had a foodgasm. Sure, this place is super busy because of the excellent food. I live in Neukoelln but happily trek on out to Charlottenburg, knowing I'm gonna be in heaven once again."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,6/4/16,"It is great Place for a fast meal. It's very small but all original handmade food. Everybody have to try this food."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/14/14,"As a Taiwanese-American, I was elated to find Taiwanese food in Berlin. I'm a pretty tough critic, but overall I enjoyed my experience at Lon-Men which brought me back to typical Taiwanese restaurants in California or Taiwan.Starting from the best, the beef noodle soup was very good, lots of heat (you'll be sweating), with tender beef, the noodles were a bit flimsy for me but that could be personal preference. The pork chop with dry noodles were good, chili oil wontons just ok IMHO (I have a high standard, few places ever get it right), and gua bao was disappointing, lacking on filling and flavors (go to Street Food Thursday/Bao Kitchen).Despite my criticisms, I will definitely go back to try more dishes, I'm still just happy I can find Taiwanese food in Berlin! Plus the staff is friendly :)"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,6/14/16,"I was in town for two weeks on a solo trip and this joint was one of the few Chinese / Taiwanese places that seemed noteworthy, especially given that they actually sell ???. That said, I was slightly miffed that their ??? seemed to follow the Mainland tradition of the dish; I was pretty hyped up about the prospect of eating a Taiwanese-styled ???. The ??? was okay, but overall the place is priced really well. If you're feeling like you want some good Chinese food while in Berlin, be sure to stop by!"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,11/6/15,"I had never had been one for soups for dinner and was quite skeptical about it, but with the more than pleasant reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try. Thank GOD I did. This was wonderful. The waiters are wonderful and helpful. And the noodle soup with crispy duck was phenomenal. Also the dim sum was clearly made by the gods."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,10/29/15,"What is better than a bowl of piping hot soup noodle on a chilly autumn day? Nothing, that's what! Pair it with some pot stickers or steamed dumplings and my life is completed. This hole-in-the-wall place has truly authentic Taiwanese soup noodle and dumplings. Everything we had was delicious. The owner was super nice too. It can get a little crowded at lunch time, thou, but that all add to the experience I think. I felt like I was in a Taiwanese night market noodle shop. :D"
Do De Li,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,9/4/14,"One of my favourite retaurants in Berlin. It's not shabby, not pricey and so authentic that the waiter is speaking Chinese with me. (Sadly I can't reply in Chinese) I often come here for the chicken feet. (Leave me alone I love them ok?) Beside that they have great lunch deals which go from 12:00 - 16:00 and cost about 6-7?. I can highly recommend the fried rice or the noodlepots. Latter are HUGE and so so good. You get a tablet with a bowl of broth, a bowl with rice noodles and several small plates with toppings suchs as mushrooms, seaweed or walnuts. I usually have the vegetarian one with a lot of veggies but the ones with meat looked pretty good as well.This place is compared to other chinese restaurants like ""Good Friends"" (which is close by) more quiet and elegant. The interior looks high class- almost posh and the restaurant owner is super nice. I think that's a place where you can drop by with your parents are some special date.All in all a great place!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4,Under ?10,4,11/6/16,"So far I tried only ""Crossing the bridge"" soups, but they are outstanding. You get a huge bowl of broth, another bowl with crazy amounts of rice noodles and a set of ingredients you can add , they differ depending on the type of soup. It's definitely not the cheapest but worth the price. I would just prefer it to have a little less noodles and more extra ingredients like meat slices or nuts. But I am still very happy with this place. Exceptionally good for a hangover!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4,Under ?10,2,1/27/17,"It's a basic family restaurant style. We visit for first time and expected at least fresh vegetables and healthy food. Taste was just soso, however sprouts and peanuts turned already bad. We will not come back."
Do De Li,Chinese,4,Under ?10,5,10/22/15,"One of the best asian restaurants in Berlin (seriously) . The soups are between 6 to 10 Euro and are so huge (even by american standards) that it's usually a good idea to split the soup with someone else, which they will happily let you do. You might even consider ordering the aubergine and pork dish which is another standout. Also have more exotic stuff like pig feet which aren't bad."
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,11/21/17,"Group dinner (10 people): each of us was astounded by the delicious food. Sophisticated taste and very well presented. The price is unbelievably cheap (10/15? each) and the staff was flawless."
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,8/6/17,"I love this place so much. It was one of my regular spots during my month in Berlin. I never seemed to go when I was ready for a full meal, so I would usually just get the yogurt parfait and sometimes also the spring rolls. The yogurt parfait is ridiculous, I'm going to spend the next few months trying to recreate it at home. It's delicious, creamy (unflavored) yogurt with perfectly smooth and tangy mango puree on top and tapioca pearls at the bottom. So simple but so freakin' good. The Spring rolls were super fresh, full of bright, crisp veg and tasty sauce for dipping.I got the iced coconut latte more times than I can count, it was my mid afternoon addiction. Another thing I'd like to recreate now that I'm home. The cafe itself is really pretty, service is good. There's one woman that was usually working when I was there who seems a little more standoffish but I suspect it had more to do with my English/very limited German (which is entirely on me, not her). If the man who was there the last couple times I went was the owner, as he seemed to be (or manager), he's super nice and was nothing but warm and helpful when I took my husband here 20 minutes before they closed to choose some coffee to bring home and get espressos.  (I JUST used up the last of the coffee I'd brought home with me... I'm so sad. Though I did manage to make a few ""Han Lattes"" with condense milk before it ran out!) I spent many a morning sitting here sipping on that coconut latte while journaling or reading - I never felt at all rushed. Maison Han is a lovely part of my Berlin memories. :)"
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,4/14/17,"Maison Han is another caf? owned by the young and talented couple Duc and Hong. Their approach on vietnamese coffee culture is hip and unique.Enjoy their very own coffee brand (Han Coffee Roasters) along with a slice of their homemade cake or go for their Vietnamese breakfast. From Banh Mi over pho to omelet: decide how you want to refuel. (Vegan options are available)The interior is of course super stylish just as all their venues. Pretty and bright pastel colors give the caf? a positive vibe.I usually come here when I'm in Neuk?lln and need a quiet cup of their Vietnamese Cappuccino with roasted peanuts."
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,7/14/17,"Came there with my 5 year old son for breakfast after visiting his doctor. My sons only request for doing a good job at the doctors was a hard boiled egg. After asking the first server if that's possible, he said yes. I ordered myself eggs in a pan, cappuccino and a drink for my son. The other server, who was very unfriendly came back from the kitchen and said no hard boiled egg. No explanation. I asked if was possible not to get a pan with water and boil an egg for 5 minutes. Doesn't need to be anything special. She said no, it's not on the menu, so we're not doing it. So we left and went to another cafe and asked for a hard boiled egg. Their response.. of course!So two pieces of advice. First smile and be friendly, if you can't do something explain. I was quite excited by your cafe, now I'm not going back. I was mostly annoyed with the rudeness of the female server which is why I left. And secondly here's something I copied and pasted below for your kitchen staff: -..Place your eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover, remove from the heat and set aside 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, cool in ice water and peel."
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,11/4/17,"Viet coffee tastes weak and served warm. Pricey - I'm used to paying $4 for bahn mi. 6 EUR here for a smaller size. Otherwise, the taste was good for both the bahn mi and summer rolls."
Maison Han,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,11/12/17,"Waited 30 minutes. For two sandwiches. Went in for two bahn mi to go. One with pastrami, one with tofu and extra eggs (1.5? more). also asked for chili mayo on tofu one. Server said okay. Waiting waiting waiting.  30 minutes. Got home and found out we didn't get the eggs we paid extra for nor the chili mayo we requested. Found the tofu bahn mi dry and dull and the cilantro wasn't cut so it was hard to eat; a whole sprig that kept pulling out with each bite. Pastrami was fine but not exciting. Also found them expensive for what we got in the end, not very filling. Also, ran into two friends who came in after. They also ordered two bahn mi to go, and two coffees, one without condensed milk, both to go as well. Those came in mugs to drink in house, but they drank them while they waited, but at the end of the coffee, realized they both had milk. No word on the wait time for the sandwiches, as we got out of there asap. Not worth the trouble."

MaM,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,12/2/17,"This new Thai Place is AMAZING. I cannot say how amazing the Thom Kha was! The Pad Thai is such a lovely reinvented dish with some of the most lovely intricate flavors. And do not skip dessert! Absolutely wonderful, finally Prenzlauerberg has a wonderful date night Thai restaurant."
MaM,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,10/14/17,"Good thai food with a modern twist. You get to choose between different levels of spiciness. We didn't habe any of the cocktails but they looked good. Nice service. Good prices. Decor was nice and modern. Felt fitting for a saturday night. The only problem was the music which was too loud."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,6/9/16,"Hipster they are not. But the food is lovely and the service is great, and the cook-waiter-manager is fast enough to take care of everything. Pretty good weiss beer as well. The bibimbap is great (would recommend to get the warm version) and we also loved the pork  bbq and the green tea.And btw, they do not do delivery."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,3,11/8/17,"My go-to for korean in Friedrichshain. It's super popular, so if you're going for dinner you're going to want to reserve a spot, and you're probably going to have to sit with another party because the inside is small. They removed the outside seating now that it's getting cold. Make sure you order everything you want the first time you're served, because it's unlikely you'll be able to track down service anytime soon."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,5,9/7/16,"This place has good korean food with all the banchan you want for a decent price. The service is not the best, but you can't beat the value for the buck. It is not a fancy resturant or a date resturant by any means. But if you have a group of friends and want to have some delicious sizzling hot meat and cold beer at an unpretentious place , this is the place to go."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,5/1/17,"Very good beef bulgogi and Generous portions! Tiny place, it was packed both times I was there! Friendly staff, but missing english menu!"
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,10/21/15,"Awesome, unpretentious food / imbiss.  I love coming here.  I believe the owners are actually Chinese - but still cool authentic Korean.  I also liked the fact that they serve tapas appetizers with each meal:  kimchi, 2 varieties of soybean sprouts, and honey roasted potatoes.  The portions are generous & filling."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,3,10/4/15,"Had the dol-sot bibimbap. It was really greasy. The banchan wasnt so fresh. Restaurant is a bit dirty. Its okay, but nothing great."
New Arirang,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,8/24/15,"Good Korean food!  I enjoyed the food here, it hit what I think to be nearing the authentic side.  Id like to see Buldak on the menu and some music or something playing in the restaurant.  Also he gave me a mug to drink cold mineral water from which is weird but I just drank it from the bottle.  Will come back here"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/15/15,"LOOVEELYY Bibimbap! Probably one of Berlins best. Do order Kimchi on the side, there's none in the 'bap itself. We had one with beef and one with tofu, where the beef one (unfortunately) was the clear winner. Didn't try any of their other offerings, but they looked amazing. Also, don't be confused by the five pages of religious rants - they do serve food.ps. No toilet! Go pee-pee before your visit!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,2,3/14/16,"Ixthy was out of fresh noodles when I visited so the menu was severely limited. This is unacceptable. A restaurant must learn to properly manage its inventory. I also cannot eat spicy food, so they made the Bibimbap without spiciness. I do appreciate this. The dish is a base of rice, with mixed Korean style veggies, topped with an egg. It's served in a thick and heavy stone pot that's scalding hot. Everything is the pot was undercooked. The rice was still crunchy, the veggies still tough to bite. Everything was completely bland. For about $10, this was a major disappointment. I think I got this place on an off day, because my meal was definitely not 4.5 stars level."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,3/2/16,"I had seafood soup which was spicy and tasted like the soup i always got in the US korean town! Probably one of the best bibimbap/hotstone soup in Berlin and the servers were super friendly. Very wallet friendly price but the ambience might be too much for non-Christian lol It was very interesting that the menu itself was like 3/4 page texts from the bjble and 1/4 real food menu lol. Otherwise, my only complaint is limited choices of beverages (not diet coke?!? Comeon) and a slightly limited menu for food (but it is a small place so understandablegjt was more like a small imbiss so it might be packed during peak hours. Otherwise, in short, good food good service interesting decor"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/10/16,"I got the Bibimbap, because you have to, right?! It was tasty, and I got my food very quickly. I haven't had a lot in Berlin, but this one was very well done. Don't forget to add the spicy sauce on the tables! That's the real key. The system is a bit strange and not the most intuitive - you order at the kitchen window, sit down (if you can find a seat), and they will bring your food shortly. When you're finished, it seemed to be protocol to bring your dishes back to the kitchen and pay at that time. Nothing you can't figure out from watching a couple folks work through it, but for a foreigner like me it'd have been good to know! Worth the figuring for the flavour."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,3,11/17/16,"Small place. The service is a bit harsh. Very limited offer. Most important: they don't serve any kind of alcohol!!On the good side, nice Bibimbap and nice prices. If are just hungry and not looking for any kind of ""experience"", this is your place."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,2,5/14/15,"Ixthys did not meet my expectations, but maybe Berlin is just not the best place to have Korean food. I visited in the end of March.We grabbed the menu and sat ourselves down and our orders were taken at our seats. This place has limited seating, but we were lucky enough to secure a spot. I wanted to order the jajangmyeon, but was told that it wasn't available, so my boyfriend and I both ended up getting the bibimbap. It was steaming hot when we were served (maybe a bit too much). The taste was bland even with koji jang and the serving size was underwhelming. There was not nearly enough rice.Maybe I would have had a better experience if I ordered another dish, but I don't think I would ever be back to find out."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,3/14/16,"This is a weird little restaurant with amazing food. They have no toilets and only three tables in total. I had Kimchi, Kalgugsu (#12) and Green Tea. The Kimchi was not really special, but nevertheless tasty. The main dish, a spicy noodle soup with a very rich flavour and self-made noodles was just excellent. The green tea had a distinct roasted taste, as is typical for Korea, and rounded off the meal quite well. I will definitely come back!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,2/5/16,"Best bibimbap I've had in Berlin so far (for what it's worth, I've been here only a little over a month). Tiny (capacity surely no more than 18, 19) and busy. I went at 5 and there were already only 2 seats open.A fun little exercise in cognitive dissonance -- on one hand, feeling like the walls are damning you to hell; on the other, the loveliest, kindest service I've gotten in a while."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,1/17/15,"As already mentioned by many others, this place is plastered with Christian propaganda. I knew what to expect and so do most of the guest that frequent there. Afterall it is about the food and not what hangs on their walls. However, if you are new to Korean food, as I am, you will have a hard time reading their menu. Because one has to skim through all the Bible verses first to find the menu items in between them. There are approximately three tables with about 8 seats at each table. And about four more seats at a counter table. I had a bibimbap. Ordered it because that was the only thing pictured. The menu has very few food items. If you're not familiar with Korean food I would recommend to google/research it prior getting here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating but their German/English is hard to understand.We chatted with the people at our table and one of them travels frequently to this place just for the bibimbap. So that's what we had to have too.Food is nicely spiced, the portions are big. You have to pay with cash as at many small restaurants all over Berlin. So no surprise. The next time I will go there, I will have their ramen-like soup, which is also the lowest priced dish (EUR 4.50) besides the side dishes. The side dishes include kimshi and rice, each for EUR 1. The food is priced reasonably. Each dish costs about  EUR 7-8 and is pretty reasonable for the good-sized portions. But as this was my first Korean food, I also have no comparison. There are vegetarian, fish and meat dishes to choose from.The staff is Korean, the place is clean and bright but really low budget. They have about three diff. beverages in the freezer but offer warm tea on their menu. When we got there on a Saturday afternoon it was busy and all tables were taken. But thw waiting time was short and the table was cleared quickly.We will return again because the atmosphere was warm and interesting and the food was geeat."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/26/14,"A few things have change since I wrote my review back in 2009, not that I mentioned it the first time but you use to get a little bowl of soup to go with your Bibimbap which you no longer get sadly.  The dish that was formerly known as number 14 is in fact called Daeji Bulgogi (spicy pork rice) Still highly recommended. Though on the last few occasions my friend who used to have the chicken version of this was disappointed because each time she only got  a few tiny strands of chicken, whereas the pork version is quite substantial in comparison.What I didn't mention before is that the place is quite small so you have to get there early during peak meal times to avoid a long wait.oh P.S. Curries in the area have gotten hotter since then too!!! ;)"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,10/22/14,"No English menu so we took the Bibimbap that we originally wanted. Be carefully from the red sauce, it's very spicy! Great place for true lovers of the kitchen. Authentic!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,9/4/14,Have been here once and had a Kalguksu soup  (hand made noodles). The restaurant is a small so you have to wait a bit before you can find a table. After entering you see all the christian stuff on the wall. A bit weird -yes- but I don't mind because the food is awesome. It's cooked by a korean lady who is just adorable! I bet it's all hear super secret family recipe... anyway! My noodle soup took a bit long but the waitress warned me about that. It was totally worth waiting! Would come here again but maybe not during the busy hours.
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/26/16,"Incredible vegetarian bibimbap! They serve it to you piping hot with a fried egg on top that you are then to swirl quickly with your chopsticks so the  yoke cooks in the hot rice and devour. This dish is so incredible, but I recommend it for a dinner over lunch, as the portion is quite big. Enjoy!!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,3,3/23/16,"It is unfortunate but the place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. First the good thing, the food was good and the service was quick and everybody was very nice. Also try the ginger tea if you go there, I liked that they put small pieces of nuts in there, transformed the whole taste. Now to the not so good. They use wooden chopsticks instead of metal ones that are used in Korea. All the chopsticks there are re-used (I guess they are washed) but they still remain disgusting. You basically pick your chopsticks from a container but even we searched for nice ones they were all used heavily. To me this is just not acceptable and therefore only 3 stars."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,3/1/16,"This has got to be some of the best Korean food I've ever tasted. No, the ambience is not awesome. Yes, the Bible verses on the wall are a bit odd. But all in all the food is fabulous and I've tried it all there. Highly highly recommended."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/27/15,"Aside from the wall/restaurant decorations which are all of biblical references, the food was really good! The spot is quite small with limited number of seats. Would highly recommend getting the bibimbap which I believe is probably their most popular dish!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/2/14,"For this place one rule applies: Don't judge the book by its cover. The place looked odd especially since the walls and menu are full of Bible quotes. The place itself is quite small and does not take reservations as far as I know.But nonetheless this is one of my favorite places for lunch. I always alternate between the Bulgogi and the BibimBap. Both are highly recommended. As well as the Kimchi of course! The spice level of the food is tolerable even for people who don't eat much spice stuff like me.The value for money is good. The main dishes are around 8?."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,4,5/29/15,"Really small, it feels like you have come to a family house in Korea. The food is delicious, simple but manage to but some new flavor to it! Don't forget to stir it in the pan!"
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/22/14,"I love this place and would always come again. Their bibimbap is the best I have ever tasted. The service can be at times slow, due to the low amount of people that can be served at once. However, the atmosphere is amazing, lovely service and absolutely unforgettable food."
Ixthys,Korean,4,?11-20,3,3/27/13,"This is a tiny place. The walls are covered  (I mean covered) with quotes from the bible, and the menu is 80% christian propaganda. The food is cheap and pretty good, but not amazing. The service is friendly, but they are also a little weird. Food was pretty standard Korean food, however it is evident that they use the cheaper meats and veggies in order to keep the price down. They don't serve alcohol. Eating here was a fun experience because of the weird concept of the place, but as a gastrononomical experience it was nothing special."
B?n Th?nh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/27/17,"Delicous!!! Finger licking good :) authentic vietnamese flavours, nice atmosphere, super nice staff. Great quality for friendly price! Highly recommended"
B?n Th?nh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,1/24/15,"The look like outside was too dark in night time , I passed twice time for looking haha- interior also is so so but kitchen seems like clean. The staff are very nicely maybe there're real family! The taste is not so bad. The nuddle a bit of different in pho."
B?n Th?nh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/14/15,Really good Vietnamese food. I had a chicken curry with rice (5?). Really good. It came with a nice small vegetable soup. Service is really nice. They also serve a very good coffee. I will definitely return.
B?n Th?nh,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,12/19/14,"More than just good! Absolutely fantastic!!! I had a chicken with peanut + herb sauce and it was dreamy! The service was cordial and fast, and the prices were more than reasonable. Def. will be going back and could become one of my favorite asian restaurants in berlin."
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,8/8/16,"This is the best meal my husband and I have had since arriving in Berlin two weeks ago. My husband had the crispy duck and I had the hickey with cashews and vegetables. Both were outstanding. The service was top notch. Being American, I have no real experience with ""authentic"" Thai food. It just doesn't exist there. However, this was hands down the best Thai I've ever had. We'll definitely be back."
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,12/6/15,"Went on Saturday afternoon. The place was almost empty but I don't see why.The food was delicious--I had the vegetables with ginger and tofu (or something like that; E18 probably). Their menu looks quite varied to me.Service was impeccable. The lady who took my order was very nice. I didn't have much a conversation with her, but the table next doors did and she was very open to discussing how to make the dish best for their taste."
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,5/2/17,Now that's what I call a thai restaurant. The servers where wearing genuine dresses and the food was extremely good for a reasonable price. Considering there was a congress in town and the place was stuffed with participants they were able to make some room for the 3 of us and the plates where just flying out of the kitchen. I'll definitely will go back there next time I'm in Berlin.
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,8/20/16,"A random find while walking through Berlin.Very friendly service in German and English.I love the wood craft ""painting"" ;).The food seemed authentic and was definitely delicious!"
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,4/25/17,"Very sweet people and amazing food. It was just what I needed after days of meat heavy, tasteless German fare. Granted, we eat Thai food about once a week in California so this was a bit of home. Great service and that also seems to be lacking in this area. I'll go back before I leave!"
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,10/7/14,"My favorite when I want to have a quick lunch, because our office is in the vicinity to that restaurant. Waitresses are really friendly, prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is excellent. This was a recommendation by a good friend and I never got disappointed. Great taste, fast lunch, reasonable price..."
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,1/17/16,Feeling like Thai food since we were missing it.  Walking around on a Sunday around Berlin there's not a lot of options since everything is closed but glad this place was open since our hotel recommended it. The green curry with crispy duck was one of the best I've had! Better than some of the ones we had in the states. Service is good and fast. We had a fussy 2 year old and they were so kind enough to try and make him feel better with balloons and a toy. Would definitely come back again!
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,5,2/17/15,Colleague took me here on my last trip to Berlin in June. Food was pretty good. Especially loved the pineapple mint drink. Very refreshing.
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,4,12/28/11,Food is excellent... Service a bit slow though
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,2,7/1/12,"Despite a friendly service, quality of food is a bit disappointed; too much fish sauce makes the meal very salty and rice is really bad quality for a thai restaurant"
Thai-Elephant,Thai,4.5,?11-20,2,7/12/13,Food came out fast but it took forever to get the check. Maybe it was an off night? Green curry duck and beef basil were both good.
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/1/12,"The food was really good and fresh.I ordered the green curry veggie which was nice and spicy. Goes well with their mango lassie :-)The staff was really nice and one of the waiters speaks German, Mandarin, English, Cantonese and Danish."
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,2,1/6/16,"the service was sloooooow even by german standards.menu said my red curry with shrimp was supposed to be in coconut cream sauce, it was actually more watery coconut flavored broth. :(the spring roll appetizer was very greasy."
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,5,11/18/14,Great Thai spot in Mitte. Awesome lunch special. Daily soups for 3? you can't beat it.
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,5,8/24/09,"MJAM!We stumbled upon this Thai when we were craving for lunch. Having been disappointed by a lot of Thai restaurants we didn't expect much, but the food was excellent! One of the better Thai meals we had in this area of Berlin. The soups were exactly like in Thailand... after it you just feel recharged. Very authentic flavors. Finally spicy actually meant spicy...! The red curry with coconut was very, very good. Nicely balanced flavors with just the right amount of spice, and fresh vegetables. It came with plenty of rice in a separate bowl so it stays warm even when sitting outside. Perfect! Noodles were just as good, with some fresh chili peppers, lots of veggies and chicken. Not too salt or fat like you get them at so many other places. Toilets were clean, with soap, and enough space. We were being served by a very sweet & friendly Thai lady. Prices were fine for this location:2 euro for a soup (or 3 if you didn't take a main course) and 5,50 to about 8,50 euro for a main course. The perfect place to have a good meal when you are in this area, before or after visiting the C/O Berlin (a terrific gallery / exposition place) or Tacheles for example."
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,2,11/9/12,"I went to eat at this restaurant with two German friends and we spoke in both German and English. The waitress was not very friendly and refused to speak German, even to my German friends. She was somewhat aggressive in insisting on English when we all speak German and we are in Germany. My favorite thing about the place was the vegetarian spring rolls. My main vegetable dish was bland and flavorlesscompletely boring. The atmosphere is nice, with a cute little interior and a hostess much friendlier and nicer than our waitress. I would only go back for the spring rolls and only if I am very hungry."
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/31/10,"The next time I am back in Berlin, I will be sure to stop by this restaurant. We found it while touring the area (specifically, the Neue Synagogue) and were hungry. I can't remember what my husband had, but I got the  Phan?ng Gai, which was very tasty. The servers were friendly, and prices were quite reasonable given the quality of food."
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,4,10/8/09,"Was here tonight and as usual, the food was great and so was the service. We had the Phat Thai and Duck Curry - very good. Well recommended!"
Kamala,Thai,4,?11-20,5,7/26/11,Definitely lived up to its 5-star rating. Food was very good and in a great location. Enjoyed the sights and sounds of central Mitte while enjoying fine Thai dining.
Fryday Berlin,Korean,4,,4,9/26/17,"My boyfriend and I stopped by this Korean street food stand after checking out the East Side Gallery. I ordered the dumplings with potatoes and my boyfriend ordered the Korean fried chicken with potatoes. I love Korean dumplings, especially when the wrapper is crispy and these were definitely that! My boyfriend's fried chicken was extremely flavorful! This was the perfect snack to hold us over for more wandering around the city. Definitely check it out!"
Bada Caf?,Korean,5,Under ?10,5,8/9/17,"Best vegan bimbimbap ever! Cafe Bada is a super cute tiny little cafe in the heart of Kreuzberg. Nicest staff and delicious food."
Bada Caf?,Korean,5,Under ?10,5,8/10/17,All vegan Korean cafe with awesome bibimbap and homemade kimchi. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are delicious. Didn't try the japchae or noodle dish. Owner is super nice and there's free water.
Bada Caf?,Korean,5,Under ?10,5,8/10/17,Great bibimbap and super nice and friendly service. Iam living close to that place and Iam eating there frequently cuz it's so good
Bada Caf?,Korean,5,Under ?10,5,10/25/16,"The best veggie BiBimBab in Berlin! Delicious. Also the kimchi pancakes are very recommendable."
Pho Nguyen 68,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,8/12/17,"We went to this place by coincidence, just walking around and being hungry. Soups were superb. Service very fast. Good place."
Pho Nguyen 68,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,2/5/17,"Great authentic food, fresh, and the portions are really big, especially given the low prices. The place itself is rather nice and quiet, the waiters speak English (if needed)."
Pho Nguyen 68,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/16/12,"The best rice curry in town. The food is always fresh, and they have a lunch special for 5,80 Euros including a drink. I go there at least once a week."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,11/8/15,"All Vietnamese coming here will have Banh Xeo and Chao Long (porridge with heart, liver, kidney, etc. from pig). So, Banh xeo is the must try for everybody. If you dont mind viscera and want to try real Vietnamese taste, i recommend Chao long."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,11/18/17,"Came here for its Bahn Xeo, beef Pho and its cendol-like dessert. Food were good, price was fine, but I guess you can found some better Vietnamese restaurants in Berlin."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,4/23/17,"Compared to other Vietnamese restaurant, the food here is quite authentic. The date when I dined there, I found there are quite many Vietnamese. The food was quite ok, big portion and reasonable price. If you got chance to visit here, could order popular no.94 egg pancake and wrap it with veggies. This dish tastes good and I have rarely seen it somewhere else in Berlin."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/9/17,"Fairly priced Thai food with a quick and friendly service.My favorites are the Noodle salads."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2/16/17,"Very authentic Vietnamese restaurant, you can even see that with the visible number of Vietnamese customers in the place.They also have an extensive vegetarian/vegan menu. Prices are OK, Service is very friendly."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/1/15,"Banh Xeo Saigon is a small restaurant somewhere in nowhere well hidden and easily to be passed by. My friend took me here since he heard this is the only place in Berlin where you can get proper Banh Xeo (vietnamese cr?pes with filling).When we heard the name we expected some restaurant focused on Banh Xeo but it turned out that they only serve 2 different types of Banh Xeo (both for 4,50? and rather a starter than a proper meal). The rest of the menu are different Vietnamese dishes (from the South and the North). I have to admit that I was disappointed at first since I expected more Banh Xeo creations but as I studied the menu closer I discovered their vegan dishes. And damn... they know how to do it. First: They also have dishes such as ""Bun Bo La Lot"" (grilled beef in piper lolot) which I've never seen as a vegan dish before.Second: The plates are decent. Not crazy big but not super tiny either. I hate it when they serve food in small size zero plates.Third: You will be craving for some more. Not because you are still hungry but because it was so good.I had a vegan Banh Xeo with fresh lettuce and herbs as a starter and yeah it was really good. Super crispy and the filling was nice as well. Since my dad is from Hue I am used to spicy sauces to go with Banh Xeo and here they serve it with mild ones. Guess that's a regional thing...As main course I had the vegan beef with piper lolot (what a funny name) and yeah don't know what to say: The seitan (I guess) was well seasoned, juicy and perfectly grilled. The rice noodles where topped with peanuts and roasted onions and went very well with the salad.  My advice would be: Take the Banh Xeo as starter and go for some other dish to make your meal perfect."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,10/26/15,"We came here after reading all the Yelp reviews about it being very authentic so I guess I had my hopes up too high. Interior isn't very pretty, very basic, a little bit of kitsch, nothing exciting but I could ignore that if the food was great. The menu is pretty big they also have 2 pages just dedicated to vegan dishes (but many of the featured ""duck imitation""and that does not sound very appetizing...) then they have a few pages for ""standard Thai/viet dishes"" aka meat/sauce/rice and then they have what they call ""specialities"". We ordered number 90 from the mysterious speciality menu and got served a big pile of rice noodles with some beef and peanuts on top and some salad and sweet chili sauce. Sauce tasted just like every other sweet chili sauce and the meat was okay. I expected something a little more exciting flavor-wise...Service was friendly and quick, low prices  (6,90 for my main) and pretty much standard dishes and flavors. Nothing too exciting but not bad either."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,2/27/15,"Honestly, I wasn't too impressed. I know, I know, this place comes highly recommended, mostly due to its ""authentic cuisine"" and its visibly high acceptance in the Asian demographic. Alas, the food didn't quite click with me. While the taste was OK-ish (apart from the ever-so-chewie lemongrass with the consistency of hard plastic), the rather smallish amount of food wasn't. In particular since the prices were, compared to other outlets of similar cuisine, ever so slightly inflated. Service was slow, too. And let's not get started on the obviously colourblind interior decorator. Or lack thereof. Not sure I will return."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/18/16,"First off, despite the thousands of Vietnamese restaurants in Berlin, there are very few places that actually serve Banh Xeo--what some might call Vietnamese crepe (although it tastes nothing like crepe, so don't be surprised). The place is a hole in the wall on Greifswalderstr. and offers great Banh Xeo, good Bun Bo Hue (a popular Vietnamese noodle soup dish that is visibly absent in the Berlin Vietnamese restaurant scene), and decent Pho. Ask any Vietnamese person in Berlin (myself included) and they will most likely tell you to go here. We all know it's so much better than Monsieur Vuong (disaster), Miss Saigon (too much mediocre experimentation imo), and District Mot (Overpriced and gimmicky). Not to forget, the place is damn cheap, too."
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2/1/16,Excellent banh xeo which exceeded my expectations. The pho isn't super authentic but it'll do in a pinch. I was impressed they had all the proper Vietnamese herbs to go with both banh xeo and pho. Restaurants in Europe tens to dumb it down for their clientele. Gnon lam!
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,6/16/15,You want tasty authentic food.. you got it. .. and the service is really good to compliment that. .
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,11/9/14,"This place must be doing something right because it's always packed at dinner time! I give it three stars because what my dinner partner had was really yummy (it was like a panko coated duck), but my chicken pho was really bad. Service is fast and prices are fair. I guess I will just have to go back sometime and get anything other than the pho!"
BanhXeo Saigon,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,7/5/15,"Authentic vietnamese cuisine. Busy, but with good service and low prices. Part of the menu is vegan."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,12/26/17,"Limited but good Dim Sun menu, main dishes also good - on this visit we really enjoyed the crispy duck w/ pancakes, spring onions and Hoi-Sin-Sauce followed by fried rice noodles with curry, shrimps, pork & vegetables. Next time we're going to try the ""Hot Pot"" which seemed really popular with the regular clientele. Good to find a decent place amongst the more tourist-oriented restaurants in this part of Mitte."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,11/9/16,"We had a craving for hot pot, so we crossed our fingers and looked for the closest place in Berlin. Lo and behold, it was less than 0.3km away so we tried it and were incredibly satisfied when we left.We tried the spicy and Chinese herbal soup bases, and thought it tasted slightly bland and not as spicy. However, we satisfied by how cheap it was for all-you-can-eat (13.50? per person). The downside was that water and tea were extra charge. The downside was some of the meat wasn't as fresh as we had hoped. The tripe and prawns looked dodgy so we opted for vegetables and beef, which were fine."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,2/1/17,"Fairly good food and experience, service was friendly. My duck was tasty. Unfortunately I woke up at about 2am with MSG head-ache and didn't get back to sleep for the rest of the night. They do mention that they use MSG in their menu, however if you're not used to eating I'd recommend staying well-clear of this place, because they obviously apply it by the truckload. Otherwise, if you're immune to the effects of MSG, I heartily recommend it."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,1/18/17,"If you feel like warming a frozen body with a yummy hot pot, this is a great place. They have an unlimited all your can eat hotpot deal. It's definitely worth money."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,12/4/16,"People seem to come here for the hot pot. We ordered from the menu and were deeply disappointed. Being Chinese myself i have high standards for Chinese cuisine and low tolerance for dishes seasoned with supermarket oyster sauce and the like. The sauce for the mapo tofu was definitely out of a can, and the sauce for the garlic eggplant as well. The dumplings were good but frozen industrial. This does not apply for the quality of hot pot, which I have not tried."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,9/26/16,"Hot pot is quite ok.  Variety of hot pot dish is not so much, but still quite authentic hot pot! Recommended!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,5/23/15,"GREAT FOOD! I've been here twice this week, once because I needed soup for a stupid cold. Twice, because the soup was amazing! Get the wan-tan suppe with pork. It's bursting with delicious wan-tans stuffed with minced pork and scallions, fresh veggies, and yummy broth. The restaurant can be a little empty early on, but ignore it because the food is SO GOOD. The service is fast and friendly.  I hope to come back one more time before the end of this trip, to try the spicy vermicelli noodles with pork."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,1/9/16,"Had the Hot Pot here, it was pretty good.  Menu was pretty good as well.  Have gone back."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,5/1/15,"Been here at least 3 times already. Good interior design, tasty food, friendly staff. Recommeded!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,10/28/15,Mix dim sum is fresh and tasty. The location is also very good. Very near the U-bahn station.
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,2/24/12,"Casual dining, Chinese restaurant located a short walk up the road from the Friedrichstra?e rail station in Mitte (~5min walk). Menu includes a range of typical Chinese dishes, but the real attraction is their 'hot pot' specials where they set up a simmering pot of soup (you can get the soup as mild or spicy as you like) on a burner in the middle of the table with a variety of seafood, meats, vegetables and noodles to cook at the table. It's the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day! Prices for the hot pot combinations are very reasonable, making this a good value and fun way to share a meal with a group I have not tried many of the items from the regular menu, but did order their noodle soup for lunch once - I was not particularly impressed by it. Stick to the hot pot if you feel like a warm soup/noodle type of meal. They also have a small range of dim sum that are quite tasty bites. I like making a meal of it by ordering a few different items. Depending on how hungry I am, I can order more or less. My favorite here is the har gaw (steamed shrimp dumpling) with a nice dip in chili sauce before popping into my mouth."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,9/29/13,"OMG, food coma, reminds me of my days in China. Just the variety of sauces and quality of meat a tick below CN level. Actually surprising, but local food is maybe always best."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/12/12,"This was an excellent Chinese restaurant we happened upon our last night in Berlin.  Although we each had an entree (mine was actually not Chinese, but rather a curry - don't ask), we'd shared an assortment of dim sum (10 pieces).  They were excellent!  While both of our main courses were good, we'd eaten so many dumplings (and that's what we like the most, anyway), that we would have preferred just sticking with the dim sum for our whole meal.I also had a mango lassi (I know, also not Chinese), that was very good, though not as good as Zum Moghulhof in Vienna (home of the Best Mango Lassi known to me).I would definitely return to this restaurant for the dim sum, and the friendly service."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,12/11/14,"I was with a couple of buddies of and we happened to stumble at this AYCE place at Oranienburger Tor.  This place is honestly fantastic; we had heaps of fish, meat and delicious broth. I've gone hot pot hopping in Berlin, and I think this is genuinely one of the best places in Berlin from a hot pot perspective. I would definitely go again with my buddies sometime soon!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,1/24/10,"Fun place for a group of friends. Pretty authentic Chinese hotpot with choices of soup bases - ranging from mild to very spicy.Eat as much as you want for a fixed price with a selection of meat/seafood and vegetables. Choices could be better - e.g. different meats, veg etc.Overall, great value, nice surrounding and fun. Was pretty stuffed at the end of it so make sure you have empty stomach to get the most out of it!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,12/9/08,"This place does an unbeatable Sichuan hotpot (or steamboat) for 12.80 Euro for all you can eat. The stocks for the steamboat are pretty authentic although I didn't agree with the peanut dipping sauce too much. There are 3 platters that come with the steamboat, a mix of vegetables and noodles, a mix of fish and cow belly (which is much nicer than it sounds) and a meat platter of chicken, pork, beef and lamb. All of that goes into the hot boiling stocks and then you stuff your face as much as you want. Watch out for the dark Sichuan stock - it's apparently a bit too fiery for some people though it was quite tame for me. It all sounds good but after the second round, it gets a bit same-ish and one can end up rather bloated. But it is still a fun night out and a great economical place to take your friends for an unusual dinner!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,9/12/12,"Was einem am Lucky Star zun?chst auff?llt ist die tolle Inneneinrichtung mit einer Kombination aus chinesischen Elementen und deutschem Stuck die sehr ansprechend wirkt. Als zweites fallen einem die sehr g?nstigen Preise auf. F?r einen Mittagstisch mit Suppe & Gericht bezahlt man ab 4,90EUR was wirklich sehr g?nstig ist. Die Suppe (Sauer-Scharf-Suppe) war sehr lecker und auf jeden Fall selbst gemacht da sie sich sowohl farblich als auch geschmacklich von den 08/15-Suppen bei den ganzen Vietnamesen unterscheidet. (Die Besitzer des Restaurants kommen alle aus S?dchina.) Das Hauptgericht (Schwein mit Sellerie in Austernsauce) war vielleicht etwas klein. Was aber angesichts der 4,90EUR und der vorhergegangenen Suppe echt in Ordnung ist. Kurz: ein Lokal dass man zum Mittagstisch uneingeschr?nkt empfehlen kann!"
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/19/17,I have eaten here twice in the last month: once with takeout and last night. I enjoyed all of the food items from the curry to Pho to fried dishes to Spring Rolls. This is some great food and my wife and I will be back.
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/29/16,"Lac Viet is a cozy and little Vietnamese restaurant in Friedenau/Steglitz near the shopping street, Schlossstra?e. It is a small family business serving great Vietnamese food for very good prices.Food: The menu includes all the typical and delicious Vietnamese dishes. The variety is great. Every time I go here, I always try different dishes which were all very very good so far. Besides the normal dishes, they also offer Vietnamese hotpot for 2 persons. They also have daily lunch menus for around 5-7 ? that I really recommend. Especially the ice teas and the shakes are fresh, homemade and tasty. They use all the fresh herbs and great ingredients, such as lime, mint, lemongrass, etc. for the drinks. Service: Two young ladies are attentive when it comes to service. They are always smiling and well-coming. The dishes are served very quick and in generous amount. Great service!Interior/Ambience: The interior is simple but not very special. The focus lies in the food rather than the interior, which is just perfect for having a quick but very good lunch or dinner.Price: The prices are very keen for the food they serve. It is one of my favourite spots for Vietnamese food, not because it is very trendy or anything, just because it tastes like home for very reasonable prices that you can not find elsewhere in Berlin! Tip: I recommend reservations, since it is most of the time fully booked and also because it is a tiny place."
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,2,5/20/17,"Nice service, but very mediocre food. The fish entree had no flavor/spices and there was a lot of filler iceberg lettuce in everything. The prices were very good, but the food was quite mediocre and not very filling. I also had the glass noodle salad and the spring rolls and both were OK - nothing inspiring, which was disappointing since the place got really good reviews."
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,3,8/23/15,Lac viet is a nice Vietnamese restaurant with decent dishes. While some dishes are great (such as the lemongrass squid) some dishes are kind of disappointing (e.g. oyster sauce chicken). I guess this place is similar to most Vietnamese bistros who serve quick and fresh food. The service is friendly. Definitely a good lunch option!
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,5/8/16,"Good vietnamese food.I had spring rolls as entr?e , the curry rice with tofu as main and a Da Chanh Cocktail. It was very delicious and the service is fast and nice.Paid around 13 Euro for everything."
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,3/7/15,"The food comes out quickly, the cocktails a huge, and it's all delicious. The portion sizes are good too! Items can be ordered WITHOUT CILANTRO (coriander) and the menu has a decent selection of items to order. I actually like that there isn't too much on the menu - that means they can concentration in what they're good at."
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,8/29/15,"Just next door to another Asian restaurant, I decided to give it a go. I have been twice and had tasty food both times. I had the marinated beef and then the lemon chicken. I them both to be very yummy but the portions are a tiny bit on the small side."
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,1/10/15,Tiny restaurant in Steglitz. The service is friendly and the food was great. Not very spacy restaurant. The coconut cream desert is a dream. Still hoped for a larger variety on the menu more scampi varieties. All in all very good vietnamese restaurant.
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,12/7/12,It is a great place to visit. Their service is impeccable and the food is awesome.
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,4,10/11/12,"Super restaurant, on y mange tr?s bien et le service est impeccable!"
Lac Viet,Vietnamese,4.5,Under ?10,5,10/18/11,"Sehr billig, sehr lecker, sehr frisch, sehr freundlich. Man kann das essen auch OHNE Koriander bestellen, was uns sehr wichtig ist. Tolles kleines Geheimnis in Friedenau!"
Dasomi,Korean,4.5,?11-20,5,3/2/14,"If you like authentic Korean dishes, than you should definitely give it a try! The food is delicious, it's not that expensive and the waitress was very friendly! Tuesday and Thursday there is Korean BBQ All-U-Can-Eat from 6 to 9 PM."
Dasomi,Korean,4.5,?11-20,4,6/3/15,"Have been meaning to try this place for a while and finally I did. The prices are decent, the owrber is nice and the interior is comfortable. Nothing mind blowing but good enough for a neighborhood Korean place. I liked the spicy dish I ordered but it was tasting a bit bland. I will try it again and will choose the bibimbap as I will be able to judge the quality of this dish due to my experience with this dish."
Dasomi,Korean,4.5,?11-20,3,11/24/15,"Having lived in Korea and being in love with Korean food, I'm now keen on eating my way through ALL Korean restaurants in Berlin ;-)I came to this restaurant for one purpose only: Dakkalbi ()!! but I was disappointed to see the menu has changed from the pictures in yelp, but apparently they have the updated menu on their website, so my bad! The current menu is pretty standard, very Western-accomodated Korean-styled food, but not as authentic as one might wish (e.g. also offering Chinese soups)I ordered spicy bulgogi ramyeon, which was quite good, though not really spicy. My boyfriend had Bulgogi, which was very disappointing, it was not seasoned well and having tried multiple versions of Bulgogi all over Korea and in different Korean restaurants in Germany and the US, this can definitely be improved!The service was nice, but not caring and the waitress did not check on us again after we've finished up. All in all, okay with lots of room for improvement - I wish they would have kept their former, more original menu!"
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,4,1/14/18,"First Korean meal in Berlin and I thoroughly enjoyed it!I ordered the beef bibimbap for ~?10 and it was delicious! It came in a stone bowl so the rice was crisped to a golden brown. The flavors were really great, but I wish that the dish came with mushrooms instead of lettuce. They also served pickled cucumbers for the banchan and gave a generous portion of gochujang for the spicy-lovers.Definitely coming back here again if I am ever craving Korean food!"
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,3,1/15/18,"Loved this place!!! Good food, nice ambience, very packed and the waiters need long time. But I would go again overall."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/16/17,"In Mitte this is definitely the best Korean to go to. The atmosphere is modern without losing its Korean identity. They are respectful of tradition, but with an edge. The hosts are very nice and the music isn t too loud. There are soooo many places in Mitte now, running along Rosenthalerstr that appear to care more about the music and the bling than customer experience. So many times i sat down in one of those places, only to leave again. Anyhow, I really like Gogogi, good place to bring a date, I m not sure it s wheelchair accessable, but should you rely on a wheelchair you will definitely have problems once you need to go to the toilets."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/15/15,"Very cozy place!Food came quickly. Friendly staff!We tried a glass noodle stir fry 8.90?, AMAZING flavours! A Korean flammkuchen with sea food, leek and vegetables. Very good, same price.And a pot with rice and salad. 7.90? and could have been a bit more exciting.This all came with a very good soya sauce and and one spicy, which was too spicy for us. We drank two home made ice teas which were both great. About 4? each. These portions were big so we were super full afterwards. Yet we decided to squeeze down a lovely banana and mascarpone dessert. Well worth it!Edit: the second time I ate here I tried the big vegetarian stir fry with lots of exotic vegetables. Tasted amazing."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/28/17,This is an authentic Korean restaurant in an ultra hip neighborhood in Berlin for reasonable prices.  What's not to like?  The flavors were not muted which is normally the case for Asian food in Germany.  Highly recommend the egg appetizer dish.
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,10/2/16,"Best Korean in town. Beautiful interior, friendly staff, authentic food, high quality ingredients."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,9/13/15,This Korean restaurant is the fanciest place around Mitte. Also there foods taste good. I liked the Pajeon and Bibimbap best.
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,7/18/15,"I am ESTATIC to finally have had authentic, delicious Korean food!! I was a little hesitant to try it reading prior poor reviews and the overall rating but I'm so glad that I did because it was so much better than I expected.The interior decoration is so hip and cool. I felt like I was eating in an art gallery. Decoration : vintage x contemporary... Used traditional Korean tables/Korean dressers and gave them a new life as a table top which I appreciate *insert OK emoji* embodies what Berlin is all about, new and old. Loved the lighting, and the pictures, even the bathroom was really neat.we ordered:Pajun: very good, loved the shrimp and the chivesGehranjjim (egg dish): didn't get to eat a lot of it because my husband and son ate it all but it was amazingBulgogi: so freaking delicious!! In the beginning stages it lacked flavor so I was disappointed but as it started to simmer and cook longer it was even better than some of the BGG I've had in Korea and America, not so heavy, perfect amount of flavor. My husband and I ordered for two people and the serving amount was always perfect. Kimchi was very good, hard to find.Negatives: not too many side dishes, but the ones they give you are delicious, just wish they had more options but maybe it's something that they'll work on.Service: A++++ waiters speak Deutsch, English, and Korean, super convenient. The waiters were so accommodating, friendly and attentive to everything, also adored my son which was super cute. Offers high chairs, very child friendly-- even gives children utensils, cups and bowls! I must mention that it is a little pricey, but the quality is worth it, ill definitely be coming back again."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,1/15/17,"The food was delicious, everyone who worked there was lovely and at the end the owner gave us a yummy drink she made out of cinnamon! It was a treat to eat here! Do it!!"
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/11/15,"Taste quite good but I have to take out 2 points:- only a bit of kimchi as the pre-meal small dishes, which contrasts with the usual practice of a wide range of those small dishes offered in other Korean restaurants I went both in Germany or US. - the slightly burnt rice crust is probably the most important part of bibimbap for me, but there is none in the one I ordered"
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,5,8/29/15,"It's so great that you can get really delicious, authentic Korean food in Berlin. I've travelled a lot to Korea and know my Korean food, and Gogogi is the real deal! Love the BBQ bulgogi for dinner, and also really enjoyed all the banchans (side dishes). I also tried the dolsot bibimbap at lunch and it was delicious, with super fresh ingredients. You can tell that this restaurant makes an effort to source very high quality ingredients for both meat and vegetables. The restaurant atmosphere is lovely, great design style but also very comfortable. The staff is great, very friendly and efficient. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Berlin."
Gogogi,Korean,4,?11-20,3,1/22/16,"Located in a hip area with cool atmosphere.  Service was quite good.  However food was not to my taste.  We had Jaeyukbokkum, sundubu-jjigae, doenjang jjigae, and pajeon.  All mediocre tasting.  I know my korean food since i have had them for all my life."
Samran Thai,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,7/10/17,"Me and my friends had dinner here without presearching. We didn't expect this much quality!!! I had chincken Pad Thai and it was so great. 7.50? for that much portion and taste, I am more than satisfied. Definitely will go back!!! Also, the young server, seemed the son of owner, is so good in English and super attentive & nice. Price, taste, and service, all are so excellent"
Samran Thai,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,5/25/17,Good home cooked Thai food. Spent time in Thailand and it taste authentic. No sticky rice but the laab and papaya Salat is very good. Will come again. Small mom and pop joint.
Samran Thai,Thai,4,Under ?10,5,4/13/17,Most Thai restaurants in Berlin serve duck deep fried and do not have Lad Nah.  This restaurant has the latter and the owners accommodated me with non deep friend duck in the dishes I ordered.  The food is authentic and I always come here when I am in Berlin.
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,11/10/17,"My favourite vietnamese restaurant off of Oranienburgerstra?e, I come here whenever I need a pick-me-up. Good prices and great food are really appreciated, and they have a rather large menu for such a small shop. Watch out for the big step on the inside."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,1/6/17,"If you want to have a very authentic Vietnamese food without any show off, just visit this friendly sweet place, probably one of the best in Berlin."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,11/12/15,"Nice place and good food to choose from :)! Can be busy around lunch time, and it's a pretty small place. But when the weather is good, you can also sit outside :)!"
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,7/17/14,"Being a big fan of Vietnamese, it was a joy finding this place off the beaten path in Berlin.  The food was fresh, delicious and reasonably priced.  I had a tofu dish that was out of this world and the chicken with a mango sauce was so light and refreshing."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,5/15/15,Inexpensive food on the go or to eat in! Their sommer rollen are super delicious and come with a dipping sauce. Their glasnudeln are also pretty cheap and delicious and if you think Germans do things not spivey - you gotta try this Vietnamese food. Family run (I think) and very friendly!
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/12/15,This little Viet Streetfood shop sells what I consider the most authentic Vietnam streetfood to take away. It is fast and yummy and I feel great after a bowl of soup number six with chicken and hot spices as well as coreandre and lime :-) I love this place!!
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,11/27/14,"God I love this little place. Since I've found it, it has been the saviour to my hungry belly many a lunchtime! I think half of the people in my company come here at lunch to be honest, it's usually pretty packed out. It's super quick service, huge portion sizes, loads of fresh veggies and great value, which is really all you want at lunch. I find the curry sauce wonderfully spiced, and they have the all important bottles of sriracha for the extra kick if you need. Definitely one of go-to places for a quick satisfying bite at lunch. Bear in mind that it is more of fast food type joint, seating is limited, in October you could still sit outside, not so sure now though..."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/13/15,"This is a great unassuming place in a kind of touristy area. The price is right, and the service is great. The soup with coconut milk is a great way to beat the cold during the Berlin winters!"
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,11/4/12,"The best Vietnamese street food in Berlin, fresh, wonderfully spiced and cheap. The Pho Hanoi is my favorite item on the menu but the rice dishes are pretty good too. This is many a take-out joint but there a couple of tables inside and out and a small counter where you can sit in the window and watch the world go by."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,7/24/10,"When I asked my German teacher - who had taught German in Vietnam for a year - to recommend authentic Vietnamese food establishments in the city this was his first recommendation. Not sure if that is really the best Berlin has to offer, but it made me feel good as I had been eating lunch here for over a year on the advice of a friend. This is an Imbiss and really only suitable for lunch or take-out, but the food is tasty, the ingredients fresh, and tastes closer to what you would expect in Asia than many of the Germanified Asian Imbisses in the city. TIP: During the week from about 12.30-1.30 this place is very busy as it services the lunchtime worker crowd. If you want to avoid long delays on food avoid these times if possible.TIP 2: The chocolate factory opposite is excellent for desert!Bottom-line: Surprisingly good solid Vietnamese Imbiss."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,9/6/10,"I put this place up on skype bur somehow the wrong address was added! The right address is Linien strasse 136, 10115. I come here about once a week and get rice noodles with tofu. Super fast food, only 2 people that work here. A woman that has 2 tiny butterfly clips in her head and never smiles, which I actually find reassuring bec they are all business and no play! Really cheap food but quite tasty. Extremely fresh. It gets very busy at lunch though as everything is made on order."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,9/10/08,"-2 stars for averageness and steep prices 5 euros for crispy chicken breast with noodles I dunno what it is exactly about Oranienburgerstrasse but this area rapes the wallet. +3 stars for being delicious, relatively decent quality ingredients and friendly, quick service. Recommended if you're in a rush and feeling like some asian eats. Not a bad place but not a great place either"
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,7/16/11,"It was the perfect place to eat lunch, close to work, only ever order two things, Com Rang (fried rice) and spring rollsit was heartbreaking to see the price raised, which cripples me because the Gemuse Com Rang went up from three to four Euro. Still highly recommend it!!!"
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,6/13/10,"healthy, inexpensive and delicious, fresh vietnamese spring rolls are main attraction in this tiny joint. The other dishes are average. Not a sit down kinda place, although they do have some benches and tables outside. I just go to snack on the rolls - they are terrific."
Xinh Xinh,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,2/3/10,Mid level viet and noodle place. Staff are friendly but food pretty mediocre
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,9/12/14,"Really delicious food, cheap and great service... which you don't always get in Berlin..! I had the tofu curry with peanut and coconut sauce which was really good!It's great that they've just stated doing sushi now too."
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,3/22/15,"Did they change the management?It wasn't really Thai or great. Service was OK, food was also OK,but nothing great or special."
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,4/10/14,Excellent Thai food for an incredible price! Definitely check this place out even if it doesnt seem to look like much on the inside. You wont be disappointed in the food.
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,3/16/14,"Acceptable, pleasant, and a bit boring. People are nice and price is right."
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,12/2/10,"If it is late and the only thing around it's not so bad. I wouldn't reccomend anyone travel very far to get to Thai- Bistro Jasmin. The food is kind of meh., but it fills you up. Make sure you double check your order, especially to go orders because I have had several experiences when they did not bring me the correct order."
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,2/22/10,"I love this little place. Pretty good thai food in Nord Neuk?lln, where it's hard to come by."
Jasmin,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,5/29/09,"This is a fantastic little place. Friendly service, low prices and the food is delicious. I'm a big fan of Thai food, and this cafe didn't disappoint at all. Good vegetarian options too - lots of yummy tofu dishes."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,9/18/17,Oh my goodness. My husband and I stopped by this place right by our hotel after a bike tour that was amazing. We were starving and this was beyond what we were hoping for. Just the smell when you walk inside is to die for. Incredible curry and pho! Even had blankets outside for anybody who got chilly! Loved it.
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,1/25/18,"Always dependable for a great dish. This quaint restaurant sits 20 meters from the i31 hotel and is a great fall back for takeout. Their food preparation is immediate and the meal was always fresh. They do use ""picnic tables"" that seat up to ~18 people per table. So if you eat there alone or in a small group, you will probably joined by strangers.Delicious food. Very nice staff!"
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,2,11/28/17,"Went to this Vietnamese restaurant hoping to have some lighter, healthier food -- the deep fried German food that's everywhere in Berlin was starting to get to me. I ordered the green curry with chicken and some spring rolls. A lighter dish I'd enjoyed many times before. The rolls arrived...and were deep fried! A surprise... Never heard of such a thing! But oh well, I figured . The curry arrived... DEEP FRIED! A greasy pile of chicken, saturated in oils. Seriously??I tried the chicken and immediately burned my mouth. Having nothing to drink, I tried to get the waiters attention. But the ENTIRE STAFF had taken  a break at the same time, all of them sitting and enjoying food together, which is great...except the place was packed with customers, like myself, and not a single employee attending tables. Many needing an employee to help. Myself quite urgently. Ugh!"
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/22/17,"Was craving Vietnamese food and found this gem. The ambiance of the restaurant is great. They have an open kitchen so you can see the chefs prepare your food behind the counter. They also have outdoor and indoor seating.We ordered the chicken skewers, summer rolls with shrimp, papaya salad and also the seafood spring rolls. All of the appetizers were great! The papaya salad comes with chicken and isn't that spicy. Not what I'm used to but none the less delicious. The seafood spring rolls weren't as packed as j would have liked and were on the more doughy side. The summer rolls and skewers were solid and I would order them again.I ordered the beef pho which was good. It didn't come with any lime so ask if you want some on the side. The bean sprouts, onions, cilantro and everything else is already added to the broth so if you don't want any let them know when you order! The beef pho was good and the noodles were dense and tasted home made."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,3/18/17,"The quality and value of this place is really fantastic. I didn't expect that I would eat this much Vietnamese food in Berlin but we ended up coming here several times. We were staying at the Titanic and so this place was just around the corner.Service was great and we had no problems bringing the baby. They have some Thai Dishes here as well but the Vietnamese stuff was quite good."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,7/12/17,Nice little restaurant next to my hotel. I grabbed something for take out and the order was ready extremely quickly.  I ordered curry tofu and it was delicious. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Minimum $10 on a credit card.
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/5/17,"Vietnamese in Germany? Yes! There are actually many Vietnamese restaurants in Berlin and without trying them all, I would definitely recommend this one. I've lived in Vietnam, eaten a lot of Vietnamese food, and this place brings the same great food and flavor that I have fallen in love with.We had some delicious spring rolls to start. I had the green papaya salad and my wife had the yellow curry and both were absolutely delicious."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/18/17,Great food and a cozy restaurant. We just moved in the area from London and are still finding out our new favourite places. This definitely falls into that category. We had the Massaman Chicken Curry which was delicious and the Honey Duck with Housing sauce. For starters the spring rolls and Satay chicken skewers. Everything was top notch.
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,5/11/17,The best curry I have ever had period! Try the Mango curry with chicken. It's absolutely amazing.
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,9/11/16,"After we did some unpacking, we went next door to Co Chu. A Vietnamese restaurant.Joel ordered the house special shrimp egg roll. It was delicious. Joel also ordered barbecue salmon. I ordered the standard chicken pho.The salmon was excellent. Had a nice crispy coating. The bed of veggies underneath was too spicy for Joel.The chicken pho was served with thick ""rice"" noodles. I was expecting vermicelli noodles. The broth was flavorful and tasty. The chicken seasoned well. Basil and bean sprouts already added to the soup. They do not bring you siracha and or hoisin sauces.Service was good. The waitress was very prompt. One minute after we sat down and reviewed the menu, she asked if we were ready to order. We asked her to come back. Then, a waiter showed up 15 minutes later.Interesting, the waiter did not ask if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered sparkling water after flagging him down.The restaurant offered outdoor seating. We took one of the table and did some people watching."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,4/29/17,"Super delicious food, lovely atmosphere, and a great price!-Had a great lunch here while visiting Berlin! The food was delicious, service friendly, and the atmosphere is very cool and inviting. Did I mention delicious food?!? :) Highly recommend it!"
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/26/17,Loved this restaurant! Had the Matsaman Curry with duck. The duck was moist and crispy. My friend had the seafood spring rolls and shrimp hot and sour. We loved our dishes and will definitely go back again!
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/19/16,"Delicatessen. I highly recommend the peanut duck (no.24).Good service and not expensive. Only ?70 for 4 people with startes + beer and wine.Will definitely go again."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,6/27/15,"Came here early Saturday evening and it was quite empty which was great as I was dining alone. The restaurant itself is very nicely presented and modern with seating inside and outside.The menu had a great choice of different vietnamese curries and noodles. I really enjoyed my tofu and vegetable curry! The vegetables were fresh and the sauce was tasty. The vegetable spring rolls for starters were also very yummy! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for tasty Asian food for a good price. Even though the restaurant itself is hidden away and just out of the city centre it is definitely worth the visit!"
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,10/13/15,"Great restaurant to fulfill Vietnamese cravings. The beef pho was authentic, service was attentive and atmosphere fun with a well designed interior. Pho was large and didn't need any other food, perhaps could share so you can get other dishes too - they looked delicious. Seems to almost have a thai influence to it."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/14/15,"Good random find on our first night in Berlin where we weren't too sure of where to venture off to.  This restaurant was right next to our hotel and even though it was close to closing time, they were still able to accommodate me and my wife.Food was authentic and carefully prepared.  My pho was delicious and the broth had amazing layers of flavor.  The only complaint I would have was the beef was a bit overdone.  Wife had the tofu with mango curry which was a complete surprise to the palate as the curry was more of a mango pur?e.  Amazing!  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Vietnamese food in Berlin."
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,10/2/16,Delicious food served very quickly. No problem booking and ordering in English. Excellent value.
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/23/14,"Modern Vietnamese cuisine done very well. I ordered one of their pho bowls (#21). I was expecting my order to come as a traditional noodle soup, instead I got a unique twist where the bowl was a combination of pho and vermicelli with the ""broth"" as fish sauce concoction. The meat had nice flavor and very tender/juicy. Any time you visit a vietnamese restaurant I recommend ordering Cafe sua da (ice coffee with condensed milk). They rocked it (pun intended). This restaurant is a bit off the main area, but well worth the venture. If you're like me, then you'll enjoy being away from the crowded, and generally over priced and over-rated restaurants. Bon App?tit"
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,7/31/15,This time tried the rice noodles with chicken and garlic sauce. Fresh ingredients and fresh taste and only 6.50 with an extra 3 euro for spring rolls. Definitely a great choice for a regular lunch!
C? Chu,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/9/15,"That was the best red curry duck I've ever had.Didn't think I even had an appetite, but I finished it all. Great option of you're staying at the Boutique i31 Hotel next door.Not expensive, and amazing food.Well done to the chefs here."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,12/29/17,"Very friendly owner and authentic Chinese cuisine.A cozy, family-style late night restaurant after opera."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,4/3/16,"In general, the food tastes fine, not really impressive but fair. If you want to have ""all you can eat"" hot pot, this place actually I feel much better than another one called Lucky Star which is also located in Berlin near U bahn station- Oranienburger Tor. With similar prices, here there are much more choices, I was surprised that they even offer scampi and mussel! Also more vegetables and the most important things is their stuff is much nicer than another. Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,5/13/14,Can be a Good choice for the chinese cuisine lovers. I ate a kind of noodle and it was OK. Good location and reasonable price by the way.
Nin Hao,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,5/24/11,"To order their speciality-Hot Pot- is experience and food is good.Interier is not charming and service is slowest I ever experienced( for example when fire at HotPot dies and you would like to call service to make it work again...or even order one more drink) ,but otherwise still nice people and dog friendly place."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,10/14/11,"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Cosy, authentic chinese decor and music.  Very large variety of dishes on the menu, but limited beverage list.  Definitely going back!  Would highly recommend when you are craving some high quality chinese food!"
Maru,Korean,5,,5,8/26/17,Excellent Korean food! Beautiful presentation and great staff. Atmosphere is perfect: k pop on the speakers :)
Maru,Korean,5,,4,11/13/17,Pretty good food but a bit expensive in comparison with the city's other asian offerings everything was pretty tasty
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/24/17,"This place was pretty decent by Berlin food standards. Prices are reasonable (3.5 for small dishes, and 7 for large). Friend & I shared 6 small dishes, which was more than enough food. Taste wise, I actually think it was quite good. Definitely better than many other Thai places that I have been. The chicken satay skewers in particular were really good.Atmosphere is pretty coolEnded up coming here twice during few day stay"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,11/12/15,"Really really yummy Asian tapas! The small bowls cost 3? and the big (BIG!) ones 7?.Food is served fast and staff is friendly and speak English. THe place itself is quite noisy, but the damp light and dark interior makes it really cozy. Usually a lot of ppl, so making a reservation is not a bad idea."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,1,2/24/16,"This is by far the worst food I have ever been served- not only did it have nothing to do with Asian food, but it was all deep fried and slathered in oil. No taste, no spice. We were four people eating and we all left with horrible stomach pain and wished we had never gone.I think it's safe to say that the people who have rated this place as 5-star think McDonalds serve the best burgers in town. Very disappointing."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,10/11/15,"On a recent trip to Germany (so recent I'm still feeling the jet lag), Transit was one of my favorite dining experiences in Berlin. The ambiance was welcoming but eclectic with the ceiling covered with hanging colorful bird cages, and the way the restaurant is set up, with one long row of tables against the wall, felt pretty authentic. We were also super pleased with the prices, with most tapas, apart from the 8 euro ""specialty plates,"" were only 3 euro a piece. In the states, each plate would easily run 10 - 12 bucks, so it seemed like a bargain dining here. They place was really busy on a Saturday night, but the two of us were seated in 15 minutes, so it really wasn't bad. If you have a big party though, definitely make some ressies. The menu (which came with english subtitles) was pretty diverse and had a little bit of everything for everyone on it. For the two of us, we ordered: crunchy veggie dumplings, coconut curry chicken, calamari, crunchy chicken spring rolls, rice bun dough wrapped chicken/veggies, what looked like duck tequitos, rice noodles with chicken and veggies, and a side of rice. Now these dishes were called sometime completely different that what I just named them off as FYI. The crunchy veggie dumplings were served in a portion of 3 with some avocado dipping sauce which was essentially asian inspired guac, and they were friggen delicious. The shell was crunchy and the filling was flavorful and fresh... and the asian guac was one of my favorite parts of any of the dishes. The coconut curry chicken was just okay, probably the least favorite of what we ordered, mostly because the cuts of chicken used were less than desirable and there was alot of dark and fatty meat used. The calamari was delish, and for me to say that is huge since I don't exactly partake in seafood often, but this stuff had some amazing flavor on it and was super crunchy and not chewy at all. They also use little whole squids, so it's not all the fried rings like I'm used to. The crunchy chicken springrolls were served as 3, and I liked them personally, but boyf thought they were only just okay. They were crunchy and not oily and the inside had small chunks of chicken and minced veggies - just as you'd expect. I did not try the duck but was told it was fantastic. The chicken and rice noodles was the most mainstream dish we ordered and while tasty, was nothing special or anything set apart from dishes I can order at any Thai restaurant. The rice bun dough wrapped chicken/veggies was one of my favorite things we ordered and unlike anything I've had. I was expecting a bun, but it was like a noodle wrap, almost the consistency of a wonton, encompassing a delicious collective of minced chicken and veggies. I did not dislike one thing we ordered, and thought everything was really well done and delicious. For dessert, we attempted to take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer of 1 euro off the pana cotta, but they were out so we got some kind of green tapioca. It was alright, not something I would probably pick out myself, but enjoyable for a few bites.   Totally recommend trying Transit out!"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,11/5/15,This place is very interesting and different and I loved it here. The service is good and you get a piece of paper where you fill out what you want to order. The dessert was great and each one of the bowls we had was delicious. I definitely recommend this place.
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,11/19/14,"It""s Asian Tapas!!!!  Not everything is great, but some are, and its all good.  I have brought many people here, and we have never been disappointed.Enjoy,David"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,3,8/16/15,"I love the concept of this restaurant and being able to try so many different things. It's tasty but it all feels a little like its missing something. So many options maybe means a bit of loss of quality. Service is ok."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/23/14,"Its lottery. Some dish r good,some r bad.Friend ordered noodle.soup(pho) .it was real bad... brooth is very important for this dish but seems.tjeybdidmt have to enough time to prepare. Booth is like water+salt. But rice dish was good."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,10/21/14,Amazing asian fusion tapas! Will definitely come again. The service was very friendly too.
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,3,2/23/16,"Good food. Bitch waitress. I dinned here the 22 of February of 2016 at 23:30, so, Im not mentioning any names, but there was only one waitress. Enough said? Now, I don't now how much time does a waitress takes to dine, but I take an estimate of 45min-1hour to fully engage (and I'm Mexican, which means Im familiar with something called ""sobremesa"" which I encourage you to research so you understand my joke). I got there at 23:36 for a two-people table. The waitress said the kitchen closed at 12:45 (which for me is more than enough), she grinned, I ask her to explain to me the juices menu, she grinned. We finish and ordered desert, she grinned. She forgot spoons and I told her if she ""wanted us out of there"" she needed to attend us fast, she grinned and mumble something for which my girlfriend and I felt super despised. We order another desert and she said that ""it was the last one she was going to give us, then the check"". Horrible service, that waitress ruined our dinner. And I have to mentioned I worked for a year as a waiter in a New York City-Soho restaurant, so, I BLOODY NOW that the customer had nothing to do with my bad mood and/or sucky life. Enough said?"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,3,8/8/13,"Really nice concept, a bit like Asian tapas. You can choose different little things from the menu which are served all at the same time. I liked 'my favorite duck' a lot! Also nice are the green curry, the yellow curry and the papaya salad. Good food and not expensive!"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,1/18/11,"Last time I was in Berlin I was not so impressed with the Asian food. Seattle boasts some high quality product and this German/pan Asian fare was not cutting it. Considering we only went to the cheapest of the cheap- it is entirely possible we were just eating in the wrong places. Because this time we found a great place. We were intrigued by the uber-styled decor of red, black, and birdcages. Those cages are works of art! A bench lines one side and I graciously let my beau take the prime seat but was surprised by the comfort of the red chairs paired with these tables. Comfy goodness.We ordered several small bowls for 3 euros and a side of rice (large bowls/soups available for 7 euro). We eat just about every meat- duck, chicken, catfish, & beef. (I try- but my man is a meat eater through & through). Also ordered a small beer (3 euro) & something called Asian Ice coffee. It says coffee- I'll try anything. Sweet Succotash what a drink! I figured out the work I didn't know was ""condensed milk"" which coated the bottom of the glass is sticky sweet. A little stir and I was in heaven. That is delicious. Also had a mango milkshake that looked like it would make an excellent compliment.Food was ordered & out like snap which can make me suspicious of the heat/flavor of the meal, but speed was just a bonus here. Everything Was Delicious. Really good. And the few spicy dishes were clearly marked (making them an obvious first choice for us) and were actually spicy! Gasp. Not like burn-your-mouth, but adding perfect heat.All of this we had for 19 euros before tip. Add this place to the go-to."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,4/9/11,"This place is awesome. I was in Berlin with a couple friends for the weekend and found this place here on Yelp. We showed up around 8:00 on a Saturday night to find the place packed (always a good sign). Then the hostess told us it would be about a two hour wait to get a table, but after some sweet talking, ""squeezed"" us into a great table near the kitchen.The menu is simple, pretty much tapas style, only Thai. Each of us got 2 dishes (about 3 euro a piece) and a dish of rice, which was plenty. I highly recommend the curry dishes, they were amazing. The atmosphere combined with the great prices and delicious food make this a winner in my book. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Berlin!"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,11/15/10,"Transit is Asian food revisited. It looks very cool to begin with. It's big, and has 2 parts: one more Asian looking part with round tables and one part with an enormous amount of birdcages hanging from the ceiling. To order you have to fill out an order form and give it to the waiter. Order some little dishes with cute names (for 3 euro) per dish or a big dish for 7 euro. If you want to sit for You can also order in 2 or 3 parts... add rice or noodles for 1 euro. 3 small dishes are plenty for one person! For small eaters 2 will even do... so I don't think it's expensive. The food varies from just good to very good. Service is sweet and fast. I liked the atmosphere, the mixed crowd (from F-hain alternatives to London hipsters) and will definitely go here again. What I like is that, unlike most Asian places in this neighborhood who just focus on feeding you, you can have a nice, and even long dinner here with friends."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,5/11/13,"Pros:Food: pretty good for Berlin, with a bit more flavour than the average asian shop. Nice to have a place that focuses on a specific cuisine unlike a lot of the other asian shops that do sushi/indonesian/vietnamese/chinese with burgers. Decor: Red, lots of red, and asian bird-cages (thankfully minus the birds). But I found it hard to read the menu with the lighting, the red on white printing is not suited for a dark room.Cons:It was bloody loud in there tonight, they could have turned the sound down a bit."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/22/10,"Transit is a modern, brightly-coloured and very welcoming restaurant. The staff is authentically Thai and Indonesian and they know their way around the menu. Maybe you think you know Asian food and you've had enough of rice, currys, meats, fish and sauces? Transit is a new upgrade of the Asian kitchen. They don't do boring Asian food, but they do Thai tapas, as I like to call them. Continue reading: Transit Restaurants Berlin at Good Food In Berlin (http://goodfoodinberlin.de/asian-food/asian-fusion-transit-restaurants-berlin/)"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/5/09,"A restaurant with a simple, effective concept. You get a menu with 18 base dishes, and an extra little menu of the day with another 8-10 dishes. Every dish costs 3 Euro, except for the rice/noodles which costs only 1 Euro. Then you mark with a pencil what you like, and that's it! The wonderful dishes appear after a little wait and you wonder how they can make any money as the portions are as big as the mains in many London Thai restaurants. Try the Pandan Chicken - it's just fabulous! And everything else is also pretty good, tasty and, more importantly, fun! The dishes arrive in a variety of interesting bowls and plates and dining here was a real delight. It's very easy to over-order but don't worry about it as it is just so cheap. The decor was interestingly red, as in very red, with lots of Asian bird cages on the ceiling. It is a great little restaurant to dine and chat with friends, and everyone is pretty much guaranteed to have a great time. So, I can only highly recommend that you try this place as soon as possible before it closes down as I cannot see how they can make any money from the prices that they are charging."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,3,8/28/09,"i'm not sure about this place. went with a friend and we split 4 dishes. 1 was excellent (shark catfish in red curry), 2 were average (grilled & minced pork wrapped in lalot leaves, and some kind of tofu satay) and 1 was bad (vegetables of the season). the pork dish was the most dissapointing because it was actually just 2 TINY mincemeat rolls wrapped in the leaves along with a few plain grilled pork strips which sat to the side. one of the mincemeat rolls had a bone that i nearly cracked a tooth on and had to spit out. i like the concept of this place, so i plan to give it another try and try some of the other dishes. but for now i'm struggling to give it 3-stars."
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,8/24/09,"We LOVE Transit!!! One of our favorite restaurants in the area!! The food is always spectacular, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxing. A mix of asian fusion served tapas style with smaller portions. 3EUR per dish and 1EUR for rice or rice noodles. cocktails are to die for! always strong and beautifully decorated with fresh fruits and orchids. my favorite dishes include the crispy shark catfish in spicy red curry, grilled pork in lallot leaves, spicy lime-marinated steak and the grilled duck. most dishes can be substituted with tofu as well!! hungry yet?? get there soon"
Transit,Thai,4,?11-20,5,8/3/09,"Look, this is an amazing restaurant for many reasons. 1. You combine the concept of tapas / small amazing delectable dishes with the idea of not choosing just one. Which by the way, they are all 3 euros. 2. An amazing Mango lassi or equivalent 3. Great service and amazing ambiance. 4. A place to come by yourself, as a couple or a large group . .. 5. No MSG! And you have Transit. This is a great restaurant, I have sneaking suspicions they are Thai, that's because of the taste of the food and the fact that I can understand what they are saying in Thai. I would say the only drawback would be: 1. You hate thai / asian food. 2. You want a ridiculously large plate to yourself without the experience of eating other flavors. 3. You don't like the color red at all. 4. F'Schain repulses you. 5. The menu is a little confusing with check boxes. However, just go. 3 euros per small dish and you can get two per person or maybe 3 for a couple. Get some rice or noodles to add some carbs and there you go . .. a well-cooked and very delicious meal. I know my husband loves all the meat options . . I go for the opposite of course and some occasionaly fish or shark."
Mmaah,Korean,4,?11-20,4,6/18/16,"I love this place. For a couple weeks during moving, I ate there every single day!The menu is small and veggie-friendly, the food comes out fast, there is outdoor seating, and the staff are above average friendly for Berlin.I love both the veggie and kimchi mandu on rice with a little iceberg lettuce salad. So filling. The potatoes and the vegetable curry are also good.Also get the melona ice pops! So good and normally hard to find.The store is also very nice and well-designed."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,1/3/16,"I had low expectations given the fact this place is in a mall food court. Looking for something vegan and gluten-free in a German mall typically means I am stuck with French fries or greasy pseudo-Asian fare. Yuck. What a pleasant surprise to find healthy Vietnamese food with friendly service. Everything is made to order in the kitchen, so you may need to wait a few minutes. No microwaved or reheated frozen food here.I had a rice noodle dish with delicious tofu, wrapped in some sort of leaf and very well seasoned. Served with a light vinaigrette, fresh Thai basil, lettuce and topped with crushed peanuts, awesome freshness for 6.90 EUR. Paired with hot ginger tea (they brew it with actual chunks of fresh ginger), the perfect lunch on a cold Berlin day."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,5/23/17,"Same than all Asian restaurants in Germany, selling the same Currys, that taste exactly the same in all Vietnamese and Thai restaurants in Germany. It has nothing to do with authentic Thai or Vietnamese food. They are very fast, only had to wait 1-2min for the curry."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,8/20/16,"It's okay, I guess. If you want to eat cheap and not looking for quality, this might be the case. The waitress, who also was the lady behind the counter was very gestured.  She did not like our questions, and much less our poor dutch. Food was okay, the soup was fine and the noodles too. I guess it is the quality you pay when you are looking for cheap food. However, Not bad."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,9/4/17,"Not authentic pho. The noodles are not  the right kind of noodles. Mints, basils, and bean spouts weren't offered with the pho. They broth is off. Pho broth should have been cooked with beef bones. The beef in the pho isn't the proper beef that is usually served. Staff was not friendly and had a bad attitude. Will not be returning. Food was edible hence the 2 stars."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,3,10/2/16,"Ordered a #22 - the tofu pho. Definite lack of vegetables in the serving - no extra basil, no bean sprouts, very few onions. I was definitely craving the broth - which seemed ok."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,5/14/16,Authentic Vietnamese food. I had pho noodle soup with beef. Very very tasty! Highly recommended!
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,12/5/14,"Third time back and food was like the other two times previously, just as fresh and fabulous! My choice this time was nos 27 and the combination of glass noodles with fresh Vietnamese herbs and spice + shrimp was ideal today, but I can also see it working for a hot summers day. Such good food!!"
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,7/18/16,Gotta love finding vietnamese gems like these. No msg added:) I would recommend the curry to anyone. Explosion of flavors in your mouth. Quick and cheap bite.
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,6/3/16,"This is located inside Mall of Berlin in the Food court on top level.Ordered the Thai Veggie Curry which was VERY FLAVORFUL, TONS OF FOOD, AND REALLY INEXPENSIVE  (6.90 eu)!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!(veggie pho was good too but not nearly as awesome as the Thai Veggie Curry)"
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,7/15/16,"Our family visited Berlin recently. While there were plenty of restaurants that offered gluten free options, we decided to grab dinner from here as a last minute choice. We were VERY happy we did.  The food was made fresh, was delicious, and very reasonably priced. We had the Bun, Pho, and curry. All gluten free and all fantastic."
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,11/25/14,Good Vietnamese food at the foodcourt of the Mall of Berlin. Order at the counter and eat at the numerous tables of this huge but very nice and clean foodcourt.
Thanh Koch,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,1/1/15,Die Speisen sind sehr authentisch und schmeckthaft. Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!
Angon,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,4/1/17,"We had a lunch there outside on a nice sunny day. It was a very nice experience. They had nice bamboo chairs.The service was very nice and they didn't hesitate to speak to us in English. She also provided good recommendations.We had some fresh spring rolls with chicken for starters and then a glass noodle salad and fried noodles. All the food was delicious and had a fresh taste to it. We alo got some refreshing ice tea with mint, lime and ginger which was really refreshing and perfect for such a hot day. We will definitely come back."
Angon,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,4,12/26/17,Quite okay vietnamese food. We had dumplings and a springroll salad with noodles. Lovely food.
Angon,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,1/31/17,"Omg, this place is the bomb! Service was womdeful amd friendly. Can I still say the ""bomb"" lol.  Anyway I've been two times and both times went  over my expectations. They have the best Pho I've had in Berlin, and the fried rice noodles w beef and vegetables is unbelievable I kid you not. BEST Vietnamese coffee I've had in Berlin. They have a great selection of teas as well. Prices are lower than se places I've been for Vietnamese but the quality of food is very good. The Vietnamese burger is also unique, modern and mouth watering one dish w curry I forget the name was rather average if you go here forget the curry and go for the gusto."
Angon,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,7/25/16,"Great healthy and tasty food with a most polite service ever. We had a big soup and curry with cashews, green juices aside. The ananas juice is to die for!Definitely I will come back"
Mr. Wang,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,7/19/15,The food is sooo delicious and u will get free Kimchi here. And the food is actually cheap when u see the size and the taste.
Mr. Wang,Korean,4,Under ?10,5,2/21/16,"I love this place. It's my favourite restaurant as of now in Berlin. I don't know how authentic the Chinese dishes were because we didn't order them, but the Korean-Chinese food was soooo yummy. We ate the TangSuYuk and the JjaJjamyeon. I have been looking for Korean-Chinese food since I arrived in Berlin years ago and just heard about this place from a Korean language teacher. Not a fancy place, but cozy and the people working there were really nice. The other Asian customers in the restaurant were speaking Korean and Chinese. A good sign, in any case! Oh and the Kimtschi was quite good - very strong on the ginger...yum!"
Papaya Royal,Thai,5,,5,11/3/16,"What a lovely quick meal option while in KaDeWe.  Had a large Papaya salad (Som Tam) and few soups, all prepared fresh, on the spot and really quick.  I do recommend it if you are looking for something fresh that tastes as the food you would have in Thailand."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,6/12/15,"In a word - a great place which offers a lot of options from all over Asia, with some traditional Tibetan dishes.Longer version (for the brave) - we arrived to this place after literally trying every option of Asian food there is, besides Tibetan. It was time.So we sat outside as the weather was nice and ordered vegetarian starters (Tsa pakora and veggie fried pockets).Watch out, as it is served HOT! got a burn from the spinach :) But it was delicious, and quite a big dish for a starter, each of them came with two dips too. I loved the Tsa pakora, it was crispy and had great flavors. For the main dish I had a traditional Tibetan dish, sorry but I forgot its name... Seasoned rice with veggies and beef with some cashews on top and an interesting curry sauce, it tastes a bit different than other curries I have tried before and it's not too spicy for those of you who can't handle it, no worries :)My friend had fried momos with cheese and spinach, I'd like to try them next time but with some meat inside, got a feeling it would taste much much better! The dishes are very big, I was kinda full half way through but it was so good I kept digging in it almost until I finished it all!Service was great and we had a great experience, the prices are really good and overall we just had great fun, no doubt I'll come again soon! All the reviews here really justify everything about this place, hopefully mine does too :)"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,9/26/16,"There probably aren't many cuisines you can't find in Berlin, but I was still surprised to see a Tibetan restaurant. Warm and cozy, decorated with candles and photos of Tibet, Little Tibet serves staples such as momos (dumplings), noodle soups, rice dishes, and a few wok-fried meats. Torn between the shaptak shoko (stir-fried beef, veggies, and potato) and a mixed momo dish, the momos won out. Six steamed and six fried dumplings (three each of minced beef & ginger/spinach & cheese) served with a light salad in a yogurt dressing and a sweet chili based dipping sauce. The momos were surprisingly light but did not skimp on the filling. It made for a satisfying (and, at ?8, quite cheap) meal."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/10/17,Very tasty!  I had a veggie dish off the house specialty page and it was great!  Service was very friendly and attentive too. She also spoke English in case you don't speak German.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,6/1/17,"Extremely pleased! Great food, friendly service, really happy customer. Did I say great food? Really great food!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/18/15,"A companion of mine suggested that we head here for dinner before heading to the theatre yesterday. She was positively impressed before and since I haven't been to a Tibetan restaurant in a long time I opted to go here as well. We ordered the spinach fritters for an appetizer, and I followed that with the mixed momos for a main dish. The spinach fritters were good, paired well with the sauce they had, and the mixed momos I had were also very tasty. I thought that the momos would be too bready, but actually they were more filling than bread, which was a plus. We also ordered the mango lassi.It seems that this place is popular; we came there around 6:30 PM on a Saturday and we got tables, but there were plenty of other tables that were reserved, and an hour later when we were leaving, there were already plenty of tables that were occupied. Make a reservation if you want to eat later."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,8/11/15,Awful service but delicious food. Really great ginger tea with actual ginger in it. Delicious :)
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,3,4/22/16,Not really authentic Tibetan food but nontheless it was tasty and the dishes came quickly.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,3/21/15,Relaxing joint with plenty of space and lots of options. If you're getting momos then prepare to wait awhile because they take time to prepare. We got the spring rolls which I wasn't too fond of but the vegetarian momos and beef momos were fantastic. Will definitely consider coming back.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/14/15,"It was a surprise place for us. We've seen it from outside and went in because I love Tibetan Buddhists. It's quite spiritual inside. A White Tara shrine welcomes you, there is photographs from Tibet and words and pics of Dalai Lama on walls. It's the first time I see Buddha in some place as more than plain decoration.Surprise part was the food. We started with some Tibetan pastry and salad, continue with large plate of mixed dumplings and duck with red curry. If we didn't had trouble breathing with all those foods we could go on until morning. All of them were great.Staff is super friendly, atmosphere is peaceful. And don't worry even though a Buddhist place there is lots of meat and alcohol =)"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,5/16/14,The food was really good and the staff was very friendly. The prices were low for the quality of the food!
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/3/15,"Good food and prices. A little oily. Had the beef and onion dumplings and a chicken fried rice with cashews and a delicious orange sauce, which was apparently a monks' recipe. My favorite was the potato pancake appetizer. The food was very good, but I couldn't finish, as it was very rich. Cheap vino"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/17/13,"So they could do something better with the lighting inside but the food was great!They have a nice but not too big variety of dishes and delicious appetizers.I'll go again and can recommend it!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,3/2/12,Super lecker!!! Geh mal wieder!
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,5/9/12,"Of the cluster of Himalayan-themed restaurants around Western Kreuzberg, Little Tibet is both the best and, apparently, the only one run by actual Tibetans. For the first indication of their authenticity, be sure to order the Butter Tea, a frothy, salty, buttery traditional brew that is somewhere between a beverage and a soup on the western palate.Tibetan food is not known for its showiness or intense flavors, but it is ideally suited for a cold winter night, and the dishes here are reliably hearty and satisfying. The standout, of course, is Momos, housemade Tibetan dumplings (steamed or fried) which are easily the best in town. A combination platter is great value and a meal unto itself, although a dipping sauce other than the default sweet-chili condiment would be an improvement. Meat and vegetable dishes here don't veer far from the path trod by many of Berlin's Asian restaurants, with Tibetan specialties fighting for attention with more Thai and Indian-influenced fare. There's nothing wrong with the fried duck or coconut soups, but they do rather dilute the concept. Still, they're a notch above nearby competitors; nothing comes off as greasy, and the vegetables are uniformly fresh and tasty.Service is also reliably friendly and fast, and the very cheap wine list makes it very easy to have a nice evening out here for under EUR20 p/p."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/13/11,"I'd never eaten Tibetan food before, so I don't know if it was authentic, but it was delicious. I got the selection of momos, and enjoyed all the flavors. The spinach pakoras were great, as were the sauces that came with them!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,3,11/7/10,"I was excited to eat at a Tibetan restaurant, and much of the food itself did not disappoint. The restaurant was full on a Friday night, which is always a good sign, and the ambience was lovely, including the charming transparent salt-bricks used in constructing the bar. The food was both familiar in sharing some qualities with north Indian cuisine, but it also had a style of its own. I enjoyed the chicken pakoras and found them light and accompanied by a mild sweet chili sauce and a yoghurt sauce - perfect as an appetizer. The timing and the service, however, was disappointing. People have told me that time flows differently in Tibet, and based on our service, I'm now more than ever convinced this is true. Our waiter did not give us our appetizers all at once, which left me in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether to eat in front of my hungry friends, or let my food get cold, or, to divide up what I had among us. The waiter continued to be inattentive to the point where we all found him rude, despite his smiling face, and even after we sought him out to ask for the check, he continued to serve other tables for several minutes. We ended up being late for a concert because of this bad timing, which left us all unsatisfied. While we were waiting for the check I noticed scores of dirty glasses and plates that had piled up on the bar over the course of the evening (and not going back into the kitchen) which made me wonder about hygiene, while I also wondered if they were perhaps short staffed, or if this was their normal mode of operation. My momos (dumplings) were tasty, but I was left a little hungry afterward and would have gladly eaten a meal with a bit more on my plate. Perhaps it is in my good nature to give this restaurant another try, since I like the idea of Tibetan food, and much of the atmosphere was pleasant. I wonder if the poor service itself was an exception, and that uncertainty is enough to give it a second chance, but only in a situation where I have nowhere else to be after my meal."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,3/2/16,"I'm admittedly not into Thai food, but cheap and delicious. The pad Thai variants can be made meatless if you ask for a tofu substitute, but it's not listed. 0,50 EUR for tap water, and if you order a soft drink, it's only in a tiny little cup."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,4/3/17,"This is probably my to-go place for authentic Thai food in Berlin. The portion and quality is great, and there's so many choices! It's nice how the food presentation is beautiful as well, just like being back in Southeast Asia. You know it's a serious restaurant when they don't serve sushi/Pho along with Tomyam (Unfortunately, there are tons of such places in Berlin.)"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,5/28/17,"Friendly people...the food is very tasty. Mom and pop place. Ran out of sticky rice. That in itself tells u this Place is good. Most do not have it, I shall return. Recommend to Thai lovers."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,12/3/16,"Who knew I'd come all the way from NYC and find my favorite Thai restaurant here in Berlin. Amazing authentic Thai food but watch out menus are not in English but waitresses speak English so if you already know what you want then you should be fine. We had the tom yum soup, papaya salad and fried rice and all of them exceeded my expectations. So much that I may have to return tomorrow so I can try the noodles and curry! :)"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,5,6/25/15,"I love it!Try Som tam, duck salad ....many other things...quality is always top.I love it."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,1/11/15,"Good for the price.  Good location. Good service. Starter 34 (poh p?a thod muh) was awesome."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,11/26/14,"Google this place and you will find many Berlin-blogs favor this place & it is with good reasonTo condense my review:Favorite Thai food outside of Thai parkFood was flavorful (ordered the Tofu + Morel dish). Didn't order spicy, but I heard, ""the spicy is real."" Tom Yum Soup gets 5 stars! So so so SO good & would highly recommend. Worth the price in my opinion with the presentation & the quality of the foodWith the Thai Iced Tea: Not sure what you're used to, but I am used to in California is sweeter flavors and the addition of milk. If you don't specify, then you will get Thai Iced tea with a lemon slice and it won't be that* sweet. Overall: YUM"
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,1,6/6/15,I would give this no stars.  This place used to be my goto thai place.  Thy changed the portions but not the price.  I traveled and worked in Thai restaurants but this place just became terrible with horrible service.
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,3,9/8/13,"mein Essen war EXTREM scharf obwohl es nur 2 Chili schoten hatte, da muss wohl was in der K?che schiefgelaufen sein.Sonst eigentlich immer gut."
Papaya,Thai,4,?11-20,4,8/13/14,"My favorite Thai place in Berlin. very authentic food for a good price. I tried many of Thai here in Berlin, since 6 years this is my fav place. Papaya is a chain though, they have 5 restaurants but the one in Kantstr is the only authentic one. Also the waitress told me that the thai ppl only come to eat here not in the other ones. The other locations are more for European taste."
Dan?s Dim Sum,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,5/3/15,"Review from stil in Berlin: Dan's Dim SumWith no lesser intent than to bring the best Dim Sum to the capital, this place has been recommended to me by a very trusted source on all things Chinese, Ash Lee. While she was also quick to admit Dan's isn't that great for vegetarians, I am still hooked enough to travel north to find out what Dan means with ""best"".Dan's Dim Sum, Gleimstrasse 17, Prenzlauer Berg"
Dan?s Dim Sum,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,3/30/17,Get the shrimp dimsum and xian shui jiao! Saved my life after missing good Asian food for months
Dan?s Dim Sum,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,5,3/15/15,"I had a soup with veggies, beef and noodles and it was really good. The service is really friendly. They also serve a nice tea. I ordered ginger tea and it was yummy. It is also cheap."
Dan?s Dim Sum,Dim Sum,4,?11-20,1,5/14/15,"I cant follow the Review of ""Stil in Berlin"" at all.  As a matter of fact, I had the worst Dim Sums ever. Dough was of plastic consistency and meet chewy."
Mamas Banh,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,9/3/17,"My boyfriend, a friend of ours and myself had dinner at Mamas Banh a few days ago and it was delicious. Best Vietnamese food I've ever had! It's a family-owned restaurant, with very friendly staff. Mama even came out to say hello to us. We definitely recommend visiting this little gem."
Mamas Banh,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,3/25/17,"A chic new Vietnamese Restaurant with lots of options for vegans and vegetarians. We had the vegan crispy pancake, tapioca dumplings, tofu and noodle salad and the fresh rolls. Nice, light and fresh. We'll definitely be back again. The service is great - it's family owned so they know the menu back to front and they're very helpful, if you're looking for recommendations, based on what you're after."
Mamas Banh,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,4/10/17,"Very good Vietnamese ""appetizers""; in fact only had a collection of those. Tapioka dumplings? You get them; chewy, delicious stuffing (and gluten free, like much of the food here; helpful, if one needs this).Sparse decoration, with magnificient glazed tiles in one of the rooms. Service was a bit chaotic, but standing by it and with open & friendly apologies - so don't expect ""grand service"", but a nice, easy neighborhood restaurant with better-than-most food. And a clear bargain, too."
Mamas Banh,Vietnamese,5,?11-20,5,4/29/17,"Very good food! The fresh springrolls were delicious, and the papaya salad was to die for. However, we did not like the bao. A bit too greasy and with an odd flavour. Bit maybe it is just us danes who arent used to that flavour. The staff was very friendly and the service was great!"
Chada Thai,Thai,4,Under ?10,4,1/31/15,"Nice, clean and fancy decorated Thai restaurant. It's slightly more expensive than most other asian restaurants in this area, but the food and atmosphere are much better. As a comparison; sommerrollen: 3,90 here, 2,50 at vietnam aroma. Most main dishes are between 6-9 euro's. The specialties of the house are around 11-13 euro. I'd recommend the crispy chicken specialty, served on a hot plate / iron pan. If you're looking for the cheapest thai this is not the place, but it's still super affordable (I mean, 10 euro's for a main dish is super cheap), but if you're looking for a bit more atmosphere and food of good quality this is the place worth visiting."
Chada Thai,Thai,4,Under ?10,2,9/14/12,"Friendly staff but little bit slow.Food was disappointing,watery and no spicy.Dogs not allowed."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,10/5/16,"According to my husband, this is the best ""Vietnamese meal"" he has ever had. Berlin's Vietnamese food is a pleasant surprise for us both especially since we are from San Jose, live close to Orange County, and traveled through most of Vietnam. We made the trek out to Bao from city centre after realizing that Vietnamese food in Berlin is legit. We decided that a place with more than a 100 reviews with a perfect rating is worth trying. Definitely worth the trek. Bun Bo Nam Bo: wow, beef is tender and perfectly seasoned. The smoky taste from the beef with vermicelli and a perfect light fish sauce. Seriously the best dry noodle dish I've had. Ca Phe Sua Da with an actual drip = amazing. I love that we can wait for our coffee just like in Vietnam"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,10/1/16,"This was already my second time at Bao since it's not far from where I live. This time I got Gari Chay (or something along that line) a vegetarian dish with curry sauce and mixed veggies with tofu, served with rice. It was delicious! I also shared the summer rolls with my friend but they were rather bland. Pretty boring filling and a boring sauce. Not bad but not a culinary highlight either. Also recommend their homemade lemonade, very tasty!"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,4/5/17,Was wondering around the area and found this place. Our group have been traveling around Europe for about a week and a half and the Asian food craving was strong at this point. This place definitely satisfied that craving. Their pho and rice dishes was pretty good and affordable. Service was great as well.
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/20/16,"Delicious food and friendly service! Definitely will come back again! Noddles are properly cooked with tasty beef and chicken, combining with a cup of tea is absolutely perfect on a bad weather day."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/28/16,"Woohoo! As good as it gets!So I had this crazy idea of taking my partner who has a cold to eat soup in Steglitz. This better be good; I haven't been here before and our trek to get here with me hauling in a sick man would go to waste if the food weren't great. After bookmarking this for a while, I see that the ratings are consistently good, averaging at 5 stars here in Yelp, so I had high expectations.When we got in, we saw that plenty of the tables were reserved, and we didn't have any reservation. We managed to score a table by the corner, and were immediately given a menu. Service is great, I have to say. The staff are polite, and they remember your needs and requests and address them promptly. We ordered a pair of spring rolls, as well as the chicken satay. Oh the satay was great, and the peanut sauce matched it quite well. And of course, we ordered pho. I would order pho every time I went to a Vietnamese restaurant for the first time, after all, if they cannot make pho correctly, then I wouldn't expect the rest to be good. And what can I say? They passed the pho test with flying colors. Better than that restaurant near Gorlitzer Bahnhof! The pho here in Bao is filled with amazing goodies, with more solid stuff than liquid. And speaking of liquid, the broth is well worth it. This is nowhere near Berlin's center, but do make the trek to get here, as they do Vietnamese food rather exceptionally."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,1/11/16,"Solid place. It's really far from city centre, but we were impressed enough by the 5-star Yelp rating to make the trek. I was expecting Bao to be more cheapish, ""authentic"" place but the actual restaurant is actually quite posh. That said, the food - while perhaps a bit ""germanised,"" is quite alright! Even my best friend, who's Vietnamese-American and VERY picky about Vietnamese food, enjoyed everything. Anyway, I recommend getting the pho! C'est bon."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/29/17,"We're from San Francisco, so we're used to good Vietnamese food--Bao is dreamy, with perfectly prepared entrees and perfect pho."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,6/18/15,Good food! Good service! Clean & Chic decors. Staff speaks vietnamese fluently as well as in German. Outdoor seating is a bonus. Simple menu with tasty tasting. I would come back here. Cheers :)
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,5/16/16,My 2nd time there within a year (considering I am not living Berlin ;) ) The Bun Ca Gio is still one of the best in this country. My friend ha a Bo Mango which he highly recommends and my warm honey drink with ginger soothes my cold a bit :) Definitely going to return in 3 months!
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,12/19/15,"You know, it's weird when you get the best pho in your life in the most unexpected places - Berlin. My friend and I are huge foodies, so we made the trek out here, which was farther away from where we stayed, because we saw all the 5 star reviews. With the multitude of 5 star reviews, we had to give this place a try. The place is run by Vietnamese-Germans (?) and they were pretty friendly and spoke English! The place was also very clean when we stepped in. Both my friend and ordered pho just because all the reviews were raving about it. The pho here doesn't have your typical, thin pho noodles, as the noodles were a little thicker. BUT the broth was so damn good. My friend who I was with is Vietnamese, so he's had a bunch of pho in his lifetime. And even he said it was probably one of the best phos he's had. The broth really tied the whole dish together, and all of the other ingredients in the bowl also tasted very fresh. At the end of it, I just wanted to drink the broth because of how good it was.If you're in Berlin and you have some extra time, make the trek out here for the damn good pho here. The area around here is pretty different from the touristy area of Berlin, so it's also good to get a different view of Berlin as well. If you're a foodie, you won't regret coming here :)"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,2/17/15,"I can't recognise the ""real pho taste"" yet but here's feel not watered down with powder things to me. And the cari chay was very fantastic! I usually order summer rolls in Vietnam restaurant but here's spring rolls is more great them! Lobely mood as well you can't find in the others. ;)"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,8/19/15,Their food is a great fusion of flavors not just from Vietnam.  Awesome service and the place is great with Outside seating. The duck was a really good dish. Their spring rolls were very refreshing. I would recommend everyone go there once to try.
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/24/14,"I traveled all the way from Anaheim, California to try this place because I have read all the reviews on here.  I live near the heart of a city (Westminster, California) that has the top notch Vietnamese Food and this Place surely did not disappoint.  First off, the customer service at this place was amazing.  I believe he is the owner but his name was Nhan.  When I told him that my friends and I were from California, he treated us like we were family and eating at his home.  I work in customer service myself so I care for the service as much as the quality of the food.  It was a very busy afternoon but he had the time to attend to all the guest which I truly appreciated.  As for the food, I was with 5 other friends so we were able to try a variety of the food.  The amazing pictures of the food truly taste how they look, Delicious.  My two favorite dishes were the fish soup and for sure the Pho.  I have taste my share of Pho in California and this place ranks as one of my top.  Don't listen to the rumors of Pho being bad in Berlin, because this place will prove those rumors wrong. It is also a great environment to drink and chill with your friends.  We never felt rush to leave because usually busy restaurants always want the turnover with tables but here we were enjoying our time.  All in all I truly feel this is a great place to try Vietnamese food.  I would highly recommend this place as a stop when you are craving some Authentic Vietnamese food with excellent customer service."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,11/2/14,"Wonderful authentic food, upscale ambiance, very friendly service and reasonable prices make Bao a top pick for the Steglitz area.  If you love Vietnamese food, this is the place to go.  It fully deserves it's five star reputation in the neighborhood."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,4,5/29/15,"Really tasty try tropical smoothie. The dishes is served quick and they always in a good mood! Try the vorspeisen aswell! Small place, but popular!"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/24/15,"Friendly service and at least two staff members speak really excellent English. The food was truly delicious for the price. The Pho with the works (Tofu, Beef, Chicken and Shrimp) was truly excellent value for 8.50 euro. Will be going again."
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,5,1/23/13,"Friendly, family owned restaurant, which is a great added plus to Steglitz. Have eaten here a few times and will always go back. The food is very tasty and the prices reasonable. Food is cooked right in the same room as the tables are in, so if you choose, you can watch your food being prepared  can also be a bit smokey or loud when the cocktails are being made, but that's just part of the atmosphere. Would def. recomend this restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy a satisfying Vietnamese meal!"
Bao,Vietnamese,4.5,?11-20,3,12/7/12,With variety of cocktails and mouth watering menu it is a good place to visit. Parking is a bit clumsy but manageable.
China Restaurant Hee Lam Mun,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/19/16,"My sister and I came here for the first time. The restaurant was very tasty! Authentic Chinese food in Germany! The service was great and so were the workers. Our food came out very quickly which was great because my sister and I were starving! The restaurant is clean and a nice size. It looks like a nice place to hold a private party. We had the tartufo for dessert, it hit the spot!"
China Restaurant Hee Lam Mun,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,7/19/16,"Visiting Germany for the first time, and it was pleasant to deal with people who spoke English! Got to have authentic, delicious Chinese food at a beautiful spot! Wish I could come back here! Too bad we're 7 hours away  haha"
King Wok,Mongolian,4,?11-20,5,1/23/16,"Huge selection! Especially for some of the exotic fresh meats you can choose from at the live grill, e.g. Kangaroo, Deer, Rabbit. Nice clean restaurant and the toilets are a treat. service is excellent! and very friendly. Highly recommended"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,4,11/8/17,"I really enjoyed my quick stop here even though the ratings were not that strong. Definitely vegetarian but it was nice to have something warm and spicy on a cold day. I enjoyed the yellow curry dish, and reasonably priced glass of rose for lunch."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,2,6/10/17,"the service was inefficient and the food was pretty blandthe server didn't really care that we didn't get our drinks until after we finished our meal or that we needed more sauce for our bun saladit was a little disappointing; i wouldn't fall for all the signs pointing you in the direction of this restaurant"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,4,1/9/16,"I luckily just happened to find this veg restaurant while walking around Mitte in Berlin, and boy was I happy! It can be a little difficult to find ""safe"" restaurants where you don't have to ask ""does this contain beef broth?"" I checked out the place online at Happy Cow and saw the positive reviews, so we headed there that evening.Not sure about the previous Yelper, but we found the owner and cook very friendly and helpful, along with speaking English to a point. We are in a foreign country, so of course not everyone speaks English! Anyway, they offered an English menu along with photos of all of the items (quite extensive menu.) We loved the food and ate there twice during our stay. Foreign restaurants are not known for spicy food (can be bland for those of us who like a little kick in our food) so we were happy to have some hot chili to add to our order. The hot and sour soup was delicious, which was a nice surprise since I usually don't like fruit in my entree (it contained pineapple.) This needed no addition of spice and opened up my sinuses! Veg head or not, I recommend this little restaurant!"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,5,11/6/16,"Fantastic food, great service. Went with a group of 6. None, except me, are vegetarians. Everyone found something on the menu and everyone was happy with their meal. At the end, the server brought us our separate checks, no fuss. She had laid the checks out on an unopened menu, arranged in order of our seating arrangement, so it was easy to find our check."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,2,4/21/16,It's ok place but i prefer healthier food options in vegan/vegetarian restaurants. Here dominate mainly fried/ deep fried dishes...
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,4,9/4/15,"Being vegan, I always get excited to try new veg friendly caf?s around Berlin. I stopped here for lunch the other afternoon and had one of their noodle dishes with tofu and veggies. The portion was nice and big, and the sauce was delicious. It was a tad on the expensive side, but that's to be expected in Mitte. Overall, it was a yummy lunch!"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,5,11/8/15,"This was a fantastic vegan, vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant. It is so wonderful to go to an asian restaurant and nearly everything is vegan (the few non-vegan options are clearly marked). We had wonderful noodle dishes, baked tofu, and an amazing fried tofu in a Vietnamese leaf that came to the table crackling hot. The food was delicious, plentiful (wonderfully large portions) and reasonable in price (for the quality). It tasted of such high and fresh quality, without a heavy after-feel. It has a basic decor, but has a beautiful large sign in the front that declares ""Peace within oneself and peace in the world."" Being vegan is one step towards that..."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,2,1/20/16,"This is more of an Asian vegetarian place. The food was edible, but not enough. We were still hungry afterwards, but the reflux of the flavors that kept coming up my throat reminded me I'm likely glad to not have eaten more. The veggies were mushy and drenched in sauce. The service was not great either. No thanks, I rather go next door to Bombay spice where there's bigger portions for less and friendly service."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,4,9/5/14,"Great for vegetarians and vegans. Plenty of outdoor seating which is great on those hot days, however the abundance of wasps was definitely anoying. The menu has so many items to choose from and I was suprised that they could come up with such a variety. The staff is really nice and the prices are fair. I would recommend Samadhi to anyone visitng the neighborhood."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,3,1/16/12,"I was sad thinking I couldn't check into restaurants in my phone in Germany without a data roaming charge, however, I can still write reviews! This is my first international one.   I spent this Christmas in the Berlin area.  After three days of not being able to eat many vegetables during the Christmas celebration since German Christmas food seems to only contain meat, bread, cheee, and booze, I had to have something green.  My friend told me to find somewhere that I wanted to eat, so  I found this place online and had my friend take me there.     We came for lunch, so there was a special with an appetizer and a main course.  I had the miso soup and the yellow curried vegetables.  The miso soup was nothing special, but not bad either. The vegetable curry was full of fresh, crisp veggies in a mild curry sauce, which was exactly what I wanted.  I ordered lime juice with soda water and sugar for a drink which was refreshing, but the glass was was tiny and it was 3.50 Euros which was a bit steep for that portion.  My friend had the same main course, but a crispy wonton for an appetizer.  It looked really good.  The food itself was priced fairly though and the portions were large.  I barely finished mine.  The service was prompt, which was great because we were actually running a bit late to our next destination.      If I was in the area for lunch I'd probably eat here again, but I wouldn't go completely out of my way to find it."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,3,7/12/11,"Absolutely cool in concept - we cook with only fresh vegetables, love and no stress. Poorly executed - food was not good and prices were insanely high."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,1,10/12/14,"Hands down our worse Berlin experience ever. Grumpy owner which doesnt speak a word in english (on one of Berlins most touristy areas) & just shout of you instead of trying to communicate, nice looking & expensive dishes which are absolutely tasteless & the bill arrived with some unexplained extra charge with no reason at all & no explanation. Nearly ruined our day, better pick a falafel instead..."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,5,4/25/13,"Steps from the Hotel Adlon and Brandenburg Gate, we stumbled upon this gem.  Outdoor eating, extensive menu, reasonable prices, and downright delicious grub.  I had the spring rolls and eggplant curry -- both were absolutely delicious (and vegetarian!)."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,5,1/10/15,"This vegetarian thai restaurant it's amazing! There's plenty of vegan options, prices are not excessivly hight and the food it's delicious! Raccomanded!"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,3,8/14/14,Good selection of vegetarian and vegan options and have nice outdoor seating. The flavor is a bit bland by our taste but we hear that Germans don't like their food spicy so they may have localized the flavor.  I find it works better if you tell the wait staff to cook it the authentic style.  Good signage to find this restaurant too and an easy walk from the Brandenburg Gate.
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,3,8/15/13,"Food is good and there's a lot to choose from - always a plus when visiting a vegetarian restaurant.  Dishes range from curries and noodles, to vegetarian versions of tranditional Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese/pan-Asian mid/range restaurants.  But portions are relatively small for the price.  12.50 euros for a smallish plate of veggie pad thai!?!  Better to go with one of the lunch specials if possible, but then you're down to just 3 or 4 choices.  Prices are probably driven up by the per diem and expense account crowds given the location.  Ambience is sparse but serene -- go here to avoid pumped in muzak common at too many restaurants"
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,3,5/7/12,"It's a nice enough place but like much of the asian food in Germany it suffers from overly gloopy sauces and heavy frying.There aren't many vegetarian eateries in that area (one block over from Unter den Linden, on Wilhemstr.)I'd go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
Sam?dhi,Vegetarian,3.5,?11-20,5,8/3/09,"One of my favorite places in Berlin. I'm a vegetarian, but, really, you don't need to be one to appreciate the food there. Forget everything you think you know about tofu. :) Their curry dishes are simply excellent."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/26/17,"By far, Hodori is my favourite Korean restaurant in Berlin. Thanks for the recommendation by a Korean friend. Don't be put off by their exterior nor outdated interior, as the food they offer is authentic, generous portioned and inexpensive. Plus, we always see lots of Korean customers eating there too. That says a lot!Their Spicy Korean fried chicken(Yangnyeom chikin) is to die for! Coated with chilli sweet and sour sauce. If possible, I would eat them all the time.Pork bulgogi (sweet and spicy marinated pork) Perfect for a decent lunchtime meal."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,3,7/31/17,"By the smells on arrival and a quick look around to see many Koreans here, there was a sense of comfort that this would be good food. And it is. They bring you all the yummy vegetables side dishes at the beginning, including a killer kimchi, which is great. We had the bimbimbap and it was delicious and filling. Nothing fancy here, this is just straight up Korean food from your local!  Great food, but much could be done to improve the service though. I know it's a more relaxed style Korean place where service wouldn't be top priority back in Korea but when it's super busy, they really need to ensure their staff can handle it (even with Berlin's overall standard of customer service, which is often low anyways). We were there on a Sunday and tables were not getting cleared quickly enough after people left, so it was also not nice to see old food sitting around for ages (as it was a super hot day). Would love to see some slight renovations done to the place, just to make it a bit more presentable overall, can kinda look a bit too run down. Doesn't look like they did anything to it since they opened! And it was super hot inside, no air-con or air flow which was hard on a hot summer day. I would go back for the food -- but would be mindful to try and go at a time they're not super busy."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,1,9/12/16,"I haven't been to Hodori for a long while now, my partner wanted to pay a visit, so we decided to come here at the weekend. And I have to say, it was really disappointed. I couldn't believe this was the same place, I gave 4 stars before.  So here is what happened. We did the reservation before and got to our table very fast, well, there wasn't many people there. and order food, thing was just find. The waitress came to us very fast, so we were just making order. I check the menu, if the food is spicy, it was writing out next to the dish's name. so after couple minutes later careful checking, we order something not spicy. About 5-10 minutes the food came. First of all, they just left the food like that on our table, at the same time, helping other to make them. My partner started to find it rude, I didn't mind to do it ourselves, so it was ok for me at first.. we ordered a Korean grilling style mix dish, which with beef, chicken and some squids. We were very excited about it, but we have to wait another 10 minutes till the food actually got cooked. We were so hungry and finally can tasted it, and turned out the food was spicy and it wasn't just  a little spicy, it was a lot that we both stop right after 2 bites. so we called the waitress who served us, she just ignored us and we called the other staff, they basically did the same, until one other waiter got stop by us, we asked him why our food is spicy and the menu said not. And he told us to wait, he didn't make the ordered. He ran away and asked other colleague of him, so another 10 minutes was gone, and still not one give us an explanation or anything. So we just went o the cashier desk to ask the reason. The waitress finally took her time to give us answer. She said she can change it for us and asked if we want just beef or chicken. We didn't get it why we have to change our dish completely. And argue with her why is that spicy when the menu said it isn't. After like another 5 minutes discussion, she said the squid in their place is already spice sauce before it server, it meant to be this way. But the yet the chicken she didn't explain and yet when we did the order, she didn't tell us, since we told her that we can't have spicy food. So we wasted about an hour here didn't get any food and seem like the staff here they didn't even care. My partner lost his app?tit for this but I was too hungry, so I asked them to change for us, this time just with beef, so another 15 minutes was gone. We could eat finally. The food was good, but it was probably because I was really hungry. At the end, when we want to pay, it took forever again, all the waitress saw us, but they just keep ignoring us. so I just went to the cashier desk to pay by myself. And I told them that we would like to take away the rest. After couple minutes later, another waiter come to us with the bag, just left it on our table. I asked him, ""so we got to packed the food by ourselves?"" he simply just said ""yes"" and walked away. So Where is the service of this place? I wonder!! Their food was just ok. It made us both so angry with this, about how the restaurant became, I just find this restaurant alright good at the beginning when I didn't know that many Korean restaurants around. but seriously, there are many other better services restaurant around and their food also tasted better. The point was the restaurant wasn't even full when we were here.  I changed my previous review from 4 stars to 1, the 1 star was just because of the food.  I don't think I will come back here again for a long while.  This place I won't recommend."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,1,10/10/17,"I work closeby and wanted to try it out, given its generally good reviews, but the somewhat neglected interior, dirty menus and humid odour served to contain my expectations.There is raw oyster with Kimchi on the menu - given the attention to detail I experienced, that would require a brave stomach indeed.After 20min of being ignored (while smiling at, signaling the waiters, getting the menu myself from them) by staff ... I left for good.I heartily recommend authentic and brilliant Chinese Da Jia Le a few meters down the road."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,1,8/25/17,"This restaurant USED to be good, but not anymore. Service is terrible and the food is so-so.  Waited forever for the side dishes and the food.  You could look past the dilapidated condition of the restaurant if service and food are good. But when those lack, then the restaurant gets a 1 star."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,4,3/28/16,"Hodori is one of the more authentic Korean restaurants in Berlin and belongs to the same owner of Arirang. Compared to Arirang, Hodori has prettier interieur and is slighty more expensive, the menu is similar but has less dishes to offer.Food: The food is authentic and delicious. The portions are big and many side dishes are served to every dish. It is one of the most delicious Korean restaurants in Berlin and so, many Koreans, Asians and Korean Food- Lovers can be found in Hodori.Service: Young waiters that are constantly stressed and tend to forget the orders from the guests. Most of the time only two waiters are serving the whole restaurant, which is why the food is served late sometimes and not at the same time. However, one should know that ""service"" in Korea is not considered as priority. In Korea when people go out to eat, they value speed and not to be disturbed while eating. Therefore the service here is not necessarily careless but rather a culture difference.Interior/Ambience: The Interior is very simple and in wooden colours. The restaurant is decorated with decent Korean details. Because the popular dish is korean bbq, the grills are causing a stuffy atmosphere, warm and smelly air inside the restaurant.Price: The prices are very reasonable considering the portions, side dishes and taste."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,11/28/15,"Came here early on a Saturday night hoping that there was still a table left and there was and the place was quite empty but shortly before we left a large group of koreans came in so maybe make reservations in advance. The menu is pretty big and they serve normal korean dishes but also hotpots and kbbq. We went for the classic Bibimbap (all kinds of veggies, cooked/raw/pickled with beef and an egg over rice). Beforehand we got served around 8 different banchans (small side dishes, usually pickled veg) and then our bibimbap arrived. Served in a stone pot and it was still sizzling! We also got served a small soup. Food was good, big portions, I was stuffed afterwards and friendly service. Prices are more on the expensive side with 11? for Bibimbap but totally justified when compared with the amount of food we got served. I am definitely coming back!"
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,4,10/22/14,"Hodori is my favourite korean place for korean bbq so far. The meat is fair, you have free refills and the price is not crazy expensive.I've been here a few times with friends and everyone was pleased so far. Beside their BBQ I can recommend their handmade dumplings and the mackerel. The bibimbap is too small for my taste but I'm happy with their BBQ.I would give them 5 stars if the staff wouldn't be so confused. It was a little difficult to get their attention or explain them what you want as a non-korean speaker. But yeah the restaurant was stuffed and they were only three so I am not mad because of that."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,3,4/2/17,"My friend and I went around 7pm on a Sunday and the place was very crowded. We were offered a table outside, which we took since we were starving and wanted to order as soon as possible. It was really warm inside. The side dishes were free and refillable, and most of them tasted pretty good. The service, however, was pretty bad. Not sure if it's because we sat outside or not, but the waiters rarely came by the tables outside. We had to ask for utensils and wait on rice for over 10 minutes because there was none available, which we also didn't find out till we asked them why the rice wasn't coming out. Our food got cold by the time we had rice to eat it with. The food is on the pricier side, but I think they're prices to expect when eating Korean food in Berlin. The taste was really good though, so if I'm ever craving Korean food, in all honesty, I would probably go back even though the service was bad."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,1,7/13/16,"This is the slowest service I have experienced, with 50+ Korean restaurants I have visited. We sat down for 15 mins, they did not even give us menu. I finally went to one of the server, and he said can you wait another 10 minutes, I'm busy(while he's just busy cleaning up the tables in the other room).We were very disappointed with the service and how rude the server is. So we left. And never again this place."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,6/6/16,"Coming from Southern California and growing up near Korea-town this is the closest you can get when it comes to authentic Korean food. Portions are large and the side dishes are fairly tasty. When we walked in for lunch there were plenty of Asians which to me is a good sign. The waitress spoke Korean, German and English. Highly recommend!"
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,4,11/9/16,So good and yummy! My Korean friend recommended me to come here! They have discount menu for Monday to Friday 's afternoon!
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,3,11/29/15,"Would rather give it a 2/5, but I'll be nice because my boyfriend likes the taste. Absolutely terrible customer service. Sunday night tonight quite busy and understaffed, I get it but doesn't excuse seriously rude waiter. Asked for refills 3 times from the same dude and watched him walk around passing us up 5 times blatantly ignoring us. Third time we asked, did a crazy ""are you for real you want more refills?"" type of attitude- aiiiiighhhttt...? Weird language barrier with the other waiter. Asked a simple question in German and he dismissed us like he didn't understand, but all of a sudden had German language skills at the next table? I don't want to continue with the details of the service. This is just a bad experience unfortunately and I am not motivated to come back. Nah, we never got those refills, even at the expense of turning off the flame and letting the food go cold just to wait for it. I suggest trying any other Korean restaurant in Berlin, there are plenty."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,4/10/16,This place is fantastic for big groups. Two years in a row I had my birthday here and still discovering more of the menu. Good to order set menus or the special. It gets stinky in there so don't wear your best clothes. What do you expect? Its a Korean BBQ!!!
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,3,10/21/15,"the restaurant is not so clean. but food was good. maybe I'll go there next time also and will try bulgogi. I recommand you dont order tee or coffee. it was awful. soup was nice."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,2/17/16,"Always full, amazing food, reasonable prices. Loads of Koreans eating here. Not much of an atmosphere and the service might be a bit slow on super busy nights...but totally worth the wait!"
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,4,3/20/16,"This is the second Korean BBQ I have had in Berlin and I feel this place is much much better than kimchi princess in comparison to prices and portions! We ordered the bulgogi for 2 for 21 euros and the portion size was incredible!! My hubby eats a lot and we ended up taking half home. They also serve you several small plates of different pickled veggies which was delish. We both ordered soups which were also a great portion and next time wouldn't order so much food. I had the kimchi, tofu, and pork soup which was sizzling and good but in most of the Korean places in Atlanta they serve an egg to crack into the soup so I was disappointed it didn't come with an egg:( my husband ordered the dumpling soup and is was very good. I only give it 4 stars because I dont like that the grills are not built into the tables and that I wasn't provided any scissors to cut the meat which made separating the meat a little difficult. All in all a pleasant and delicious experience and surely will be returning:)"
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,3/11/14,"For the area, this is five stars. Maybe for some jetset crowd, its only four. Certainly no less.if you liked arirang in the old location, except for the lighting, you will enjoy the food and service here: unpretentious, hearty. We didn't like the new location (of arirang); it felt like a disregarded modern construction inside a mall entrance next to the zoo.Starters served gratis, as with arirang. Some dried fish was also served though, and the dishes were milder, not spicy. Although there was an asian business meeting group, so if you look non-spicy to the host, it might be non-spicy served.The raw beef was as good, and the kimchi soup was just right.The interior has the old white drop-ceiling of a prior smoking establishment, but to set it off, the street outside is wide and the front windows face south."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,5,5/30/14,"I went there with 3 friends last week. We paid 63? for one big pot of fish soup for 2 people, beef and pork in pan for 2 people, 6 bowls of rice and 5 drinks. The foods were very delicious. The place was good and the price was cheap.I wonder why people complained about the cleanliness and the setting of the restaurant. For me it's clean enough. They just cannot expect to be in a palace with that type of price."
Ho Do Ri,Korean,4,?11-20,4,12/9/12,"Dropped into Hodori with a part-Korean friend who assured me this was the most authentic place to eat Korean food in Berlin (and there are many to choose from). True enough, appeared to be the only non-Korean in the place. Shared squid dish was lovely, scooped up with service nervous but very sweet. Apparently taken over recently by new owners but standards don't seem to have slipped. Location pretty misery-inducing on the main road, Hodori is no oil painting from the outside or the inside but the flavour trumps the lack of sheen. Worth hunting out. Also incidentally across the road from my favourite baklava bakery in Berlin, Pasam Baklava, so pick some up on the way out."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,8/11/17,"I was on the hunt to find amazing sushi in Berlin and I found it!The vibe of Dudu is very Berlin (hipstery) and the food is great.All of the sushi rolls come with a mix of salsa and guac on top. The first few bites I was a big fan but I think there was way too much of this on my sushi- better to ask for this on the side!"
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,1,12/28/17,"I really don't understand the high ratings for this place! I went here twice, just to make sure that the food was really bad and that I gave it a fair shot. First time there were flies surrounding my rice! Yes, I kid you not. Second time, my salmon definitely came out of a freezer. When I asked where they get their fish from, the waitress looked at me in shock and had no answer. How can you not be prepared for such a simple question at a place where you claim to serve fresh fish? The dishes are not flavorful. Nothing stood out, not spiced well and the dessert with the black rice is a catastrophe. So plain. The service is extremely slow, looks miserable and unlike other reviewers here, I did not enjoy the atmosphere. What exactly do you think is cool here? The area is turning into a crack haven for meth heads. Try to take the subway on a weekend night, you'll see. Super boring place with boring food and boring I-want-to-be-seen crowd."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,3,9/26/17,"The food was great! Really good portions and fresh!!! The place is lovely, music and location are perfect!!!The only reason why I am giving 3 stars is because of the service, really, really really slow and a bit disorganized"
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,6/16/17,"Decided to try something different on our last night in Berlin. Yelp pointed us to Dudu, which didn't disappoint. Outdoor seating was packed, but pretty much all the (long) tables inside were open. So if it's nice out and you want to sit outside, be prepared to wait. Since almost all the patrons were eating outside, service inside was somewhat slow. Menus were already on the tables, but it took some time to flag down a waiter and get one in English. Food came out in a timely manner, though. Before placing your order, be sure to check out specials on the chalk board!Dudu's menu mainly consisted of a mix of Vietnamese dishes and sushi. Decided to start with dumplings and the starter beef pho. Although both were good, I enjoyed the dumplings more. I liked how the dumpling wrapper wasn't too thick and that it was packed with pork. The dipping sauce went well with the dumplings and wasn't too sour or spicy. I liked how you can order a starter of the pho. It was the perfect size to get a taste of the dish, leaving room for other items on the menu. The small bowl was packed with noodles and beef shavings. The soup itself didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked it to, but it was still good. Our main meal consisted of a variety of rolls that we shared. The salmon avocado and tuna rolls were pretty good, although standard. The fish was fresh and the ratio of fish to fish was good. The crispy yellow roll, one of Dudu's special rolls, was just okay. The roll itself was deep fried and contained avocado and cucumber. Separate from the roll was diced spicy tuna that you were supposed to eat with the roll. If I knew it would came like this, I don't think I would have ordered it. I was over the actual roll pretty quickly, but really enjoyed the spicy tuna.I also tried some of C's ""rice for kids"", which was a small bowl of soup rice with chicken on top. He quickly ate all the chicken, but left most of the rice. Again, didn't know the rice would be rice mixed in a broth. You could tell the broth had ginger in it as the taste was pretty prominent. Not so sure this is a good idea for a kid's dish...the only kid's meal offered.Price of all the food was reasonable, although pricier than typical meals in Berlin."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,3/4/17,"Wonderful friendly service. Came in as a party of 12. They took really good care of us.The dumplings were amazing in the dipping sauce so flavorful. The Vietnamese spring rolls were just OK.The sashimi and sushi were extremely fresh and delicious tasting. Very impressed. The rolls are generous, big portions.The chicken curry was OK. Could have used a little bit more heat.Overall really positive and enjoyable experience. Would definitely recommend and come back."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,3/5/17,"Went here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had reservations but make sure to book a table, it gets pretty crowded in there. Not a lot of space in between the tables.Menu offers an Asian fusion mix based around Japanese cuisine and focused on sushi. Treated myself to the seafood bowl which was amazing!!! Different kinds of sashimi on a bed of rice and some greens. Also some tempura shrimp. It was topped with  some tomato salsa and guacamole which was heavenly! The fish was fresh and of really high quality and the toppings just took it to another level! Cool place to enjoy some high quality sushi but not so much the place to go to for a quiet conversation as it can get pretty loud in there."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,7/18/17,"I recommend this place for tasty food, fantastic atmosphere, attentive service, and pleasant outdoor seating. I went here alone as I was solo traveling in Berlin for a few days. I got the seafood plate which was delectable. Additionally, I sat outdoors in a hip, modern seating area that was brimming with people. The clientele here were also great, and I found myself staying for 2-3 hours talking, drinking, and eating with the locals. I strongly recommend this place."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,3/15/17,"Amazing beef and Sushis...Probably the best in the City.If the restrooms were a little bit cleaner, a 5 stars rating would have been in order."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,10/31/16,A really cool place with relaxed atmosphere and amazing Asian food where they also know how to make nice sushi. Definitely try their spicy edamame! It's a great choice for chilled evenings with friends as well as relaxed evening with your partner. The prices are also very reasonable
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,12/21/16,"Really the best restaurant in berlin.So stylish nice music.Nice serviceAmazing food and cocktails.Must visit there and must try the tunacado roll and the myso beef tower.Really recommend if you are into lounge spot with amazing sushi, great cocktails and great atmosphere."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,6/3/17,"This was a hidden gem in Berlin. It's a little difficult to find, but it had amazing food. The restaurant had a cool atmosphere to grab drinks with friends. The sushi there was extremely fresh and great flavors, with a bit of a twist. It was very crowded when we went (8:00pm) so if you have a chance, get a reservation. Highly recommend Dudu!"
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,4/26/16,"How on earth this place has a rating less than 5 stars? This is more unfair than Donald Trump being close to becoming the candidate from Republicans. Whining aside and focusing on food, I have to say that in any other major city such as NY, LA or Moscow, the food Dudu offers will be served only in very upscale and expensive restaurants, and I am talking restaurants like Nobu, not just around-the-corner-posh places. The catch is though that the price tag for this amazing food could be around 25 euros. Surprised? I am too. I will not go down describing every dish on the menu, will just say that 2 most popular positions are Crunchy Dudu and Seafood Plate - stick to those. As a bonus I'd really, really recommend trying desserts - they indeed deserve a praise. Again, you will not be able to try THIS level deserts in any other restaurant for ridiculous 4.5 euros."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,2/8/17,"Great place to sit, relax and eat sushi with friends!! Especially in summer, I recommend the terrace, nice atmosphere and service. Sushi are quite expensive but worth it! Good Asian beer, I am going to come back!Book a table if you are planning to go with a group!"
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,7/22/17,Different looking place for an Asian restaurant. Long bench seating inside and on outside terrace. Friendly staff that speak English too. Lunch menu was a good bargain with entrees including salad. I would come again.
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,3,7/24/16,"Ok, I really really do like Dudu. I love the people who work there, the owner is hilarious, the people who eat there are generally sexy and its in a great part of town. It also is one of the best sushi places in Berlin... Actually I only go there for sushi which is what my rating is about...So why only a 3 star rating? Well, I just can't help it. I've been in Berlin for 5 years now and I'm so happy to be here I wake up every day, jump out of bed and do a little jig because it's so amazing to be in Berlin. But one of the only things it's missing is a high standard for sushi. Dudu is one of the best places in Berlin for sushi, but in other cities with a higher standard, it would just be pretty average. It's doesn't blown my mind at all, it's not like I chomp into it and just lose it how good it is or anything like that. It's just pretty good, and actually, comparatively just too expensive for what it is. But in the context of Berlin, maybe 4 stars, but not in the context of this review unfortunately. Just as an example, they have a 'crispy tiger maki' which is just a shrimp tempura roll with salmon on top... And a spoonful of guacamole on the side. It's just so average (although good for Berlin) and maybe 13 or 14 euros. I dunno, just kinda lame. The rice is good. But yeah really just 3 stars. Not mind blowing, not memorable, but decent and too expensive for what it is."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,3,8/16/16,"There is quiet a local Hipster crowd coming here to enjoy some Asian Fusion food. I was a little disappointed about the atmosphere and the uninspiring staff, they were not the friendliest and had some attitude. The food is healthy but not authenticly Asian, I found it too experiemental and the flavors are too diluted."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,3,2/3/17,"It used to be great but the prices increased, the staff got less friendly and you are meant to order, eat and pay in less than 1.5 hours. And the portions became smaller. overall not great anymore..  This place used to be one of my favourites. But it's not anymore... Very disappointing experience tonight."
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,6/20/16,A local friend brought me here. I was so happy! I definitely recommend Pho Beef...everything beef here. Coming from the US (great beef) now living in Munich (which has horrible beef)...apparently DuDu is known for their beef. This is a East meets West Fusion. I had a Crunchy Veggie Tempura Roll with guacamole and the side of ginger and wasabi. Yummy! So good I didn't have time to take pics. Great fresh fruit cocktails. Best place I have been to in awhile. ...it was so good I went 2 nights in a row
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,5,7/27/15,"In a word - a place with a statement. Asian fusion restaurant with style and a saying.. And one of the best curry dishes I have ever had. Longer version (for the brave) - everyone always have a good thing to say about Dudu, but I always thought its unaffordable.Don't let the looks fool you, yes- it is a bit pricy for Berlin.But you can totally handle this :)We went in and got a place outside, as we arrived before the evening peak we had a lot of seats to choose from.The menus are simple without too many options - but that's pretty much all you need.Some starters, sushi plates, a few soups and main dishes, and about 2 or three kinds of desserts.Simple. That is the key.There's a big board with specials and offers which most are not on the menu, so don't forget to check it out too!We started with the papaya salad with tofu which was absolutely amazing.The dressing was very light and you could still enjoy the vegetable flavor.The main dishes didn't arrive too long after - and my oh my - this is PERFECTION in a plate.If you ignore the unpleasant surprise in the shape of fresh tomatoes in my salad (will I ever get over my hate for fresh tomatoes???)This is by far one of the best curry dishes I've had in a while, if not the best one.Thin slices of chicken, perfectly made rice, fresh salad on top, peanuts and creamy curry with a special flavor (our guess is that there's fresh anise in the curry that gives it a nice twist) I loved every single bite of it, and added a bit soy sauce for saltiness and some fresh red chili pepper just to make it a bit spicy, exactly how I like it.It filled me up real good, even though the dish is not too big, spot on people! Even the sushi and the seafood dishes that I don't eat looked so good I was tempted to ask the people next to me for a bite hahahaAll in all - a starter, two juice glasses and two main dishes for 27? is ok, and it's really worth it. So treat yourself! To some it all up - had a great experience, and would be happy to come again soon!"
Dudu,Sushi Bars,4,?11-20,4,8/7/16,"I came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  But we didn't wait long for a spot as they managed to squeeze us into a table with another group.This was a happening place though it seemed like a jumping-off platform for those going heading to clubs. There was a lot of base bouncing off the walls and it made conversation difficult. I was rather annoyed to be sitting next to a group of rather large and very boisterous American girls. Now I digress as I certainly can't fault the restaurant though I proper table of two would have been nice, or at least an inch or two of elbow space.It's been awhile since I've had some good sushi, but Dudu really hit the mark with taste, freshness and generous portions considering the hipster aura of it all. Our server was polite and pleasantly fast with our drinks, food and bill.While I was in the mood for something a little low-key since i was weary from a day of travel, the food and service made up for any shortcomings."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,9/19/17,"Best and long standing amazing thai asian fusion restaurant in Berlin.Don't go, so I can find spots when I go :)"
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,1/24/18,"Excellent Asian Tapas. Don't miss the ""Cozy Green Curry""."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,1/13/18,"Perfect spot for a quick and mid price meal that will surely satisfy cravings for asian food. Dimly lit room and dark wood are nice if you ignore the ugly bubble lights above ur head. We still visited many times during a short visit of Berlin.bowls are 3,50 ? and I'd return for the Cumi cumi (squids with a sauce that bursts full of umami) and ""forever young"" while i quickly grew over other offerings in the menu."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,5/23/17,"My meal at Transit was amazing. The food was fresh and fantastic! It  came unbelievingly quick and was hot! Everything you want but never expect from a ""trendy"" restaurant. Stefan my waiter was so efficient and so professional I wanted to buy him a ticket to a city where tips were important! He'd make a killing.I had the prawns in avocado - unique and deliciousThe duck with five spices was  - incredibleMy saut?ed mixed vegetables were mostly Bok Choy but perfectly cooked. The crispy chicken and pork rolls were bland and not my favorite, however they couldn't affect my happy experience at this restaurant. Loved it."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,8/4/16,"We came here for lunch, ordered 5 dishes for 3 of us, none were exciting. I liked the duck in pajamas, but that's it. Portions are tiny. We left unsatisfied and hungry. Table next to us also complained about the portion size. We decided that this place was a waste of our time and appetite."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,5/28/17,"This is my first review, so it may not live up to the standards, but I will try my best ~So first of all, I went here with my friends, sat down and had to say that the atmosphere was really ordinary. The dimmed light gave cozy vibes and it felt like you walked in another dimension. But sadly enough, the service was kind of spaced out and didn't really pay attention to us. It may have been like that because we are still adolescents and they didn't feel like they needed to give us their full attention, but these are just mere speculations.The food was mediocre , it didn't taste bad but it was nothing special. The ordering system was new to me because you had to tick the boxes with the menu you want to order and give the piece of paper to the waitress. This was really fascinating~So that's why I gave the restaurant only 3 stars.Hope I helped you with this short review :)"
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,11/26/17,"Reservation is recommended.  It's very crowded and table are very close to each other.  Food is not overwhelming, but okay if you're craving for Asian food in Berlin. Yet I'll keep trying to find good Asian food restaurant in the city."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,5/29/16,"Was looking for decent restaurants near our hotel and this was within walking distance. The 4 stars on Yelp also helped me pick this place. After eating here, my friend and I wish that we had something similar in NC.They have both indoor seating and outdoor seating. If you're not fan of American hip-hop music, you can definitely choose the outdoor seating, which is in a closed courtyard behind the building. After our waitress explained to us how the small plates and big plates worked, we both decided to get 3 small plates each at 3.50 Euros per small plate. Large plates were 8.50 Euros. I ordered the following with a side of white rice.15. My Favorite Duck (Grilled duck breast with five spices)16. Cumi Cumi (Crispy Calamari)19. Gado Gado (Steamed vegetables with fried tofu)The grilled duck breast was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce goes really well with the duck. The Cumi Cumi was nice and crispy not to mention also very salty. The sauce helped to tone the saltiness down a bit. Although the dipping sauce threw me off a bit because it had a strong odor and taste. I think there might have been some fish sauce in there. The steamed vegetables were OK. I mainly ordered that so I can have some vegetables in my dinner. The price range is very reasonable. We were just happy that we no longer had to pay $17+ for dinner every night like back in Switzerland. To be honest, you can probably feel full after just ordering two small plates and a side of white rice. We barely finished our food because we underestimated the amount of food.Service was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,11/8/17,"Interesting asian-fusion Tapas restaurant. The food was good, not delicious, and while the food was well priced, the drinks were pretty expensive for their sizes."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,12/13/16,"Good points and bad points here! And take cash - no cards accepted.Good - the green curry sauce was delicious. And the crispy prawns with avocado dipping sauce? Glorious. ?3.50 a plate was a good price, and the rice at ?1 was good, too!Bad - The duck rolls had a chewy layer of skin/fat. The thai beef dish was overwhelmed by lime and fish sauce. The chicken in the green curry also had chewy skin. Service was slow, and when they brought me the wrong item, the waitress was rude about it (but did take away the wrong thing and bring the right thing). Drinks are absurdly overpriced - ?3 for a soft drink? All in all, we left full for ?22 for two of us - but we also left a fair bit of food behind. I'd go back though, and order more carefully."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,4/27/17,"This spot has great atmosphere, service and music, but the food wasn't very inspiring (would give it 2.5 if I could).  We had the fried prawns, duck, duck pancakes, fried egg roles, rice noodles, gado gado and beef.  We both agreed that the gado gado was the best option and the rest was very mediocre.  In addition, my stomach wasn't the happiest after our meal.  Would recommend looking elsewhere."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,11/12/16,"The food was pretty good!  The favorites for the evening were ""Forever young"", Cumi Cumi, ""Party Girl"" and ""Eve's Favorite""!  Portion sizes are small, so we ordered several different dishes and shared them!  If you don't have experience with chop sticks, I suggest that you practice before trying this place!Alcoholic drinks are strong, but tasty!And the best part is the atmosphere! Very upbeat and So-ho!  Worth every penny spent!Thanks Transit!LJ , the Food CriticTraveling from Country 2 Country"
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,3/25/17,Lovely food and atmosphere! The service was very good and the food came really quick after we ordered. Good vegetarian options and the most of the dishes can be served with tofu. You get a good amount of food for a very nice price. Good wine! The music was very suitable as well. I had a very nice experience and I really recommend this place.
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,11/19/16,"Checked the place out with my Chinese friend - she likes to go to their other location in Berlin. For me, the newcomer, this was quite a cool idea and concept. 3.50 per plate, you basically order the whole menu and share with your friends. The food was good - for me Westerner. My Chinese friend said it is not that good and the other location is better. Why only three stars you might ask? Well... service was not too attentive and not too friendly, the location is super loud and the table we had was on the way to the kitchen and bathroom. So tons of traffic. The cocktail (Moscow Mule) I had was almost just a soft drink. and pricy for that."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,7/31/16,"One of the best meals of our two week trip in Germany!  Taste was delicious, variety of choices was huge, and prices were very reasonable. We each had two small plates, and all were delicious: green curry, duck, satay, tofu was offered as protein for many choices. Service was good, and it is fairly close to main train  station. We will definitely return."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,5/19/16,"Think Spanish tapas but this time, thai/Indonesian food.I've always appreciated this concept, all my choices brought to me at once. It's not difficult to mess up an order since you input your choices on a check list and then hand it off to the waiter.As for the food, the food was good, the curry was good since I'm a big fan. Reasonable prices for good food, I left satisfied.This place is great to try out once, but to come back a few more times? You decide."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,2/8/17,"Stylish Asian fusion food place, which is always crowded and you should better have a reservation unless you want to wait. Atmosphere is great and the food, ranging from soups, ebi tempura to Thai Papaya Salad. I really liked the style as the dishes were all tapas a-like portions. I recommd a blend of everything =) Gonna come back when back in Berlin for sure"
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,3,8/18/15,"Food above average, but not spectacular enough along to justify the price. Mediocre service also played down the rating. Went here for lunch with a quasi business purpose and it was great for that. The meats on a stick were tasty with a very nice Vietnamese style sweet sour liquidy sauce, and the beef chili salad was delightful as well; fresh and light but meaty!"
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,5,11/29/16,"While I lived in Berlin, this was my go to place for an amazing meal. The menu is filled with small, delicious plates. Shrimp, beef, veggies, everything was very tasty. Also the staff is attentive, which is amazing."
Transit,Indonesian,4,?11-20,4,5/4/15,"Cheap and delicious. Ordered 3 small plates (3 Euros each) per person and it was just the right amount. I would recommend 4 per person if you want to be full.The flavors were a little bit too strong though. Most dishes could have used less salt or sauce.I would recommend:- 06: Duck in Pyjamas- 09: Smoky Sate"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,10/8/17,"Who knew Asians German can cook up the best Thai meal I've ever had! I live in Los Angeles where there are tons and tons of Thai restaurants some very authentic. Yet, my aunt treated us out to Mao saying this restaurant is one of the best in Berlin. She was right! We were treated wonderfully by the owner she was so sweet. The atmosphere was upscale but still had a homey feel. Everything we had ordered was amazing! Chicken curry was excellent and so was the pineapple fried rice!"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,10/10/16,"The food is fresh and the flavors are authentic! I've been here three or four times now and everything I have ordered (and anyone I have been with) has been totally delicious. The coconut chicken soup is perfectly balanced and the glass noodle salad with minced pork makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Also, when you ask for chili they bring you a caddy with a good selection of proper spice. This place is great for business lunches, friend dinners or date night. The service is kinda standard nonchalant Berlin style, not overly friendly but efficient nonetheless. Not super cheap but the quality is apparent on your plate. I'll keep bringing people here whenever I'm in the area- it consistently satisfies!"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,2,12/29/16,"One of the worst meals in a while... We went there for lunch and the restaurant was almost empty but that didn't prevent them to take an hour to serve us the soup from the daily menu and when it arrived it was way to sour. For the main course we had a fried fish that was completely soggy and tasted bland. The coconut beef curry was just average at best. Nothing to do with Thai food. To sum it up, service takes very long in an empty restaurant, food is not good, prices are ok. Really not sure how this place has that many good reviews. My advice, go anywhere else in the area, there are plenty of other great options."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,5/7/16,"For someone who is an avid fan of Thai cuisine, this restaurant is a must. Excellent service, and all of the dishes we sampled from the menu were 100% authentic. I highly recommend the chicken in the red curry sauce served in coconut. I look forward to my next visit to Mao Thai the next time I am in Berlin."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,6/9/15,"Business lunch with 4 participants went well. One dish came wrong but was solved quickly and friendly. Dishes are nicely presented, and fish was fresh. Definitely a good choice for Thai food. Pricier than the average Prenz'lberg restaurant though. Waiters quick and friendly. Toilets clean."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,11/29/14,"Mao Thai was excellent. Thom Yam Gai is one of the best I've had (and I've a lot). Service was friendly and attentive. Not the cheapest place, but you can taste the quality. Drink the 3euro beer over the 5euro water!"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,3/9/14,Great seafood. The front atmosphere is not as comfortable and cozy as the back. Service wasn't too great. Prices slightly too high for the food served.
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,3,11/5/12,"First Thai restaurant in East berlin ! Since 1993, an authentic thai kitchen with an efficient service."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,3,6/30/09,"I had the business lunch option, which consisted of a soup and a main dish for EUR8,60.The spicy chicken soup, Thom Yam Gai, was very authentic.I was a little disappointed with the green beef curry, which contained green beans (I don't think one would normally find them this meal), while really I was hoping for thai white aubergines.All in all the food was tasty though and definitely above average.The service was efficient."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,11/2/10,"This place has great decor and style but food was just okay. The chicken satay was great but there ""very spicy"" curry was just one step above black pepper as far as spice levels are concerned."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,6/22/09,"Great food, great service !Highly recommendableA little more expensive than usual Prenzlauer Berg restaurants, but definitely worth it !"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,6/8/12,"Nice outside seating, good not great food"
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,8/4/10,"Business diner with 12 participants went well. One dish came wrong but was solved quickly and friendly. The food came in stone pots, pineapples or other nice shapes and forms. Eating Thai food often, I would say that this restaurant is a good one.Waiters quick and friendly. Toilets clean.I saved this address for frequent use."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,4,7/2/08,"Very tasty, a bit upscale, Thai just off Kollwitz Platz. Lots of outdoor seating on a moderately quiet street. I didn't go inside, so can't comment on the decor. Interesting, though limited, wine selection. We had a South African Black Gold red which was very tasty at approx. 32 Eur. The food was fresh and flavorful, with a wide variety to suit all tastes. Service was attentive and professional for our party of 8. Good option for a nicer Thai place."
Mao Thai,Thai,4,?21-40,5,5/3/09,"Excellent - Very tasty (especially, in our case, the appetizers and the bean and peanut salad). Good value for money, great location near to a very nice, bustling part of p'berg. Highly recommended"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/13/17,"Delicious Chinese food from Sichuan and Canton. The different kinds of Dim Sum variations are awesome.This is place to be if you like to enjoy Dim Sum."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,1/6/18,"They made the best hot and sour soup of my life. Nice casual and elegant setting. Service is quick, if not brusk. They could improve upon the friendliness. They seem well equipped for large groups. I saw many tables were already reserved. The red curry was good but not great."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,10/24/17,"When you visit an Asian restaurant and you are the only non Asians eating...you know you are eating at the right place. Great atmosphere, good location and amazing food. We had the dinner for two and it was extremely filling... could have been for three or four light eaters. We left a lot of food. If your looking for not Chinese not Thai not Japanese... but something like it... this Asian hits the spot!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,10/19/17,"I joked that this is the place in Berlin where all the veggies go. People crow about the duck here, but the veg red curry and clay pot were both amazing. Full of a wide variety of veggies, really fantastic flavors, silky tofu. Never thought I'd love Thai curry at a Chinese place but the red curry was excellent. Bay Area, CA born and raised so I'm used to both cuisines, in their restaurant form. Spice level is decent if slightly dumbed down for the northern EU taste. This was the only place we ate in a Berlin that I could see myself returning to regularly. Really quite lovely. Oh. And FAST."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,11/10/17,"I was in Berlin in early October. My niece and I toured the Museum Island. We found Jolly nearby, with pretty good reviews, so we decided to have lunch here. We ordered crisp duck, small steamed dumplings, spicy lamb and mushroom/vegetables. What a surprise! Every dish was delicious! My niece studied in Germany for years and now works in Hamburg. She said this was her one of her most favorable Chinese meals. We at Chinese and I am from NYC area. That tells you how good the food was! We highly recommend this restaurant!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,11/7/16,"We had a lovely dinner at Restaurant Jolly! The interior was like a fine dining restaurant.It was kind of funny how they had candlelit dinner tables with a romantic setting and people were chowing down with their chopsticks and rice bowls haha.We came here as they are famous for their peking duck. It was really good! We were starved after a full day of touring around Berlin and finished the day off dining here. Service was excellent.I'd recommend the:* Sweet & sour soup* Peking duck* Stir-fry veggiesAlso, a note to travellers.. they have free wifi! :D"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,9/3/17,"Good Asian food for Berlin, good Asian food period. German food is sorely lacking in spices and after a week of wursts and potatoes, s schezuan  kick to the  stomach was very welcome. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Dim sum even, not half bad."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2/13/17,"I went tonight with a group of 10... (We where here for the Berlin film festival. )  .. Amazing food. We had Duck, eggplant, more duck, Beef with veggies, fish with veggies, Duck, rice,  Dumplings, chicken... The best tasting Chinese food.. We loved it.... Best spot in Berlin... A+  A  recommend.. Get the duck lol... (Tea, the sesame balls, wine, etc... I will be back."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,8/21/17,"Really delicious food. Big portions. Great atmosphere. Overall, would certainly recommend."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,2,7/22/17,"As an Chinese American, this restaurant seemed to have treated me like some disowned family member. Almost no attention was given to me.  I was given a small corner table while the German/white customers got the roomy tables - even for 2Person groups. The hot and sour soup has a TOMATO base!  Definitely not authentic.  The Jolly tofu pot was passable.  Interestingly used spam.  No shrimp. On the positive side, the tables and chairs and whole ambiance was good.  Just that they have some sort of reverse discrimination.  If you r Asian, u know what to expect. Not fully authentic Chinese food and possible poor treatment."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/18/16,"A really good choice for Asian food in Berlin. The food is very tasteful and staff is super nice and helpful. The dishes are enormous. We were 4 people  and didn't manage to finish more than half of the food, so a tip would be to perhaps start with one dish to share (if couple) - then add another one if still hungry.. Or have starters before sharing."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,3/6/17,A good variety of Asian regional food grouping. All items on the menu where good portions and rich on flavors. Still an authentic place that keeps some traditions in place. Certainly a place to repeat!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/5/17,I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 and the place was not packed at all. Amazing value and great atmosphere. I ordered the lunch special with duck and noodles for around 8 euro. It was delicious!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,7/7/16,"This restaurant is a must-try! I have never before had authentic Chinese food outside of China - until I went to Jolly! A little expensive but great food. I had dinner here with my boyfriend to celebrate an anniversary. We met in China, so we decided to have Chinese food. We ordered the roasted duck with prawns and vegetables, beef with black pepper and silk tofu. All dishes were great! I would probably order duck without prawns next time though since they didn't taste much, or try the Peking duck!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,12/31/16,"We (2ppl) ordered the set menu for two, a bottle of water, two large beers and a small beer all together at 43 ?. the set was as a whole very delicious and highly recommended. the servings and the pacing between dishes was good. I usually eat a lot and was skeptical there would be enough food to fill my appetite--there was, and with leftovers! The ambient is calm and stylish. The set included:-sweet and sour soup-4 egg rolls-the main dishes (breaded duck and beef stir fried) served on the same platter and with a large bowl of rice-vanilla ice cream with deep-fried bananas"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,4/13/16,"Solid Chinese food. All that's missing are some more pork dishes, such as some crispy belly ;)Their Peking Duck is the thing to go for, but everything else I tried over a few visits were all good. For Chinese in Berlin, very good even. Efficient service too and nice to be able to look into the kitchen."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,10/2/15,"I would have never imagined that I would I'd end up having Chinese food in Berlin!  In any case, after a long day of touring Museuminsel on a chilly spring day, this was the closest restaurant to the island we could find, so we figured to give it a try. It ended up being a good decision!Being Chinese, I think I can validate the authenticity of its food. We especially loved the dim sum choices that were offered as part of the menu. After weeks of traveling in Europe, this was my first taste of home! For less than ?30, we had quite a feast for two!The restaurant was surprisingly crowded on a weekday night. There was a mix of tourists and German business people. I'm taking a star off for its ridiculously slow service and lack of menus. The table next to us waited literally 20 minutes to get a menu! And we waited just about the same time to put down our order. The friendliness of the waiters and manager made up for the slow service in the end, though."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,4/10/16,"Amazing crispy duck and dim sum. My partners soup was good as well. Nice ambiance and friendly service. The duck was enormous, easily enough for two with appetizers. Two drinks, two apps and a main course came to 32 euro. Well worth it!!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,12/29/15,"Possibly one the best... neigh, thee greatest Asian food I've had in Europe, would honestly consider a trip back to Berlin just to eat here. The sweet and sour duck with lychee was amazing, along with the duck curry, and fried noodle with chicken, top tier. Duck game strong tho. Would recommend again and again."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,6/20/16,"Great food and nice place, staff looked very bored though."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,10/7/15,"We visited Minty after a 1-hour body massage in Sophak (very closeby in Pappellalee 76) and after checking Yelp for recommended restaurants.The price/quality offered at Minty is very high and we definitely recommend a visit when you are in the area. We took 3 plates which we shared with the 2 of us and we paid just 20? for this food and 2 drinks : worked organic Tofu with salty crust + rice, pommelo salad with chicken + an ice cream. The quality of the ingredients is top and the dishes are prepared with a lot of care. The menu offers some original choices.Highly recommended for those who love Asian food."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,7/7/17,"I was here with two other friends, who seemed to have a good opinion about this place. Alas, I was not too impressed. I ordered the noodles with various things in them (No. 24), plus an appetizer of fish wrapped with leaves. I also ordered a Minty Power. The Minty Power was good, and I ordered another one. However, the noodles wasn't really memorable. It was OK, nothing more. In other words, it was nothing to write home about. Maybe I just tried the wrong thing. In any case, I don't see a reason why I would come back, given that I know other Vietnamese places that definitely delivers good food."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,9/11/16,"I came here after all the five star reviews.The three stars represent my opinion that it's average at best:- Food taste and quality about average (actually that's being kind: the portions are generous but my stir fry noodle was flavorless- Food appear to take a while to be prepared... came out slowly (25 min wait for stir fry noodles when the restaurant was only a few customers)- Service could be more team oriented than hierarchical: Despite there being 3 people at the restaurant, only one poor sweet girl kept waiting the tables even when it started getting busier as I was leaving... Cos the 2 other dudes who appear to do nothing but stand behind a bar because he may be the manager dude or some other guy just sitting outside chilling and smoking outside could care less about the customers. I was patient with my food but waiting for the bill was another chore.The inner decor is cool and calming, and there is a bit of outside seating that is parallel to the train bridge.If you are all about portions and happen to be in this area, give it a try! But if you have only one meal here and are seeking Berlin's best; I'm not sure if I can say this ticks off all stars...FYI with only 2-3 customers when I arrived, it took me 50 minutes here, most of it waiting time as I was hungry, in a rush and devoured my food quickly."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,1,2/1/17,"We had been to the restaurant various times as we did like the food and for sure would have gone again. But following the last visit this will never happen again. The waitress noted the wrong dish number and the wrong dish was cooked. This can of course happen and there is no problem to wait until this has been rectified, and all would have been fine. The management of the Minty has taken a very interesting approach, to solve the situation. The waitress was adamant that I have ordered that dish and they will replace it but I have to pay the higher price of the wrong dish. Mistakes can happen but being accused of lying and being told I had ordered something which I did not and to pay their mistake, is absolutely atrocious..... Therefore will this place NEVER see me again AGAIN."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,4,7/17/16,"I always walk by this little vietnamese place and decided the other day during meetings to finally try it. I like that it was not super crowded during lunch time, what you always have to expect in Mitte. What I liked about the menu is that they have authentic vietnamese dishes and lots of different small starters. We ordered Pho Ga, salmon starter and one of the lunch menu which included rice with chicken and vegetables and a small soup with tofu and rice noodles. It was really tasty! Me as a asian myself can recommend this restaurant to all asian food lovers! And a big positive point goes to the super friendly staff, which is really rare in Berlin. They made you feel welcome. :)"
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,12/13/14,"This is already my favorite Pho in Berlin, and it just opened. There are three types of beef to choose from, and all of them are delicious (I recommend #3 personally).Ambiance is minimal and modern, music is well chosen, food arrives super fast.The staff is friendly and helpful (am I in the same city?!), and they take cards without making you feel bad for it.I'm amazed at my excitement, but I'm not making this up. Come and see for yourself."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,3,1/1/16,"okay, but not five star. If you visit this reataurant will you be dessapointed because of the high rates at yelp."
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,7/15/15,Absolutely fantastic food. Vegan alternatives and regular dishes as well. Prices are moderate and service is good. The interior is minimal but cozy. Highly recommended.
Minty,Vietnamese,4,?11-20,5,3/14/15,"Very good and authentic Vietnamese food. Fair prices. Big portions. Young, competent service staff. Grandma cooks. Don't miss it. :-)"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,9/22/17,"We've eaten Chinese in lots of place around the world and this ranks easily in the top 3. My wife had gong pao chicken and I had the fried black pepper beef; both were superb. Veggies sweet and crunchy, meat cooked to perfection. We also has an order of baked shrimp crackers--marvelous. And the service was attentive and efficient and very prompt. Perhaps prompted by reviews here, waiter told us tip was not included.Highly recommended."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,8/4/16,"I give this place a solid 4 stars. I went to this spot during their lunch hours so I was able to order from their lunch menu. The prices were super reasonable with their lunch menu. Each person's meal ranged from 7 to 10 euros. I ordered their fried tofu. As far as my drink, I opted for their rose blossom tea. I recommend both of these options for lunch. In total I paid about 12 euros for my drink and lunch. The fried tofu is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce is kind of salty. Thus, I would have wanted more rice. I suggest you order an extra bowl of rice to counter the salty level of the tofu dish."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,9/30/16,"They don't actually stay open as late as they say. Hours aren't accurate. We arrived a half hour before the listed closing time, and we weren't allowed to be seated. Despite telling him that his hours posted on the door indicate the restaurant is open, we were turned away. Don't waste your time."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,9/11/17,"Wow! Good food and service- actually some of the best we found in Berlin. Vegetable options, English and German menus, high quality food. Highly recommend."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,8/24/17,"OK food, but terrible service! Wait forever to get my check. Be careful, they'll secretly add tips on your bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,2/28/17,I had such high hopes due to all the great reviews. And I got disappointed. Had a soso honey pork dish which really didn't flash me at all. The sugar peas where rather spare and overall the dish was pretty bland. Bummer!
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,5/14/16,"I only order one thing , but it's not goodThere's Expensive meal but using cheaper material, the yuxiang shredded pork should with carrots but they are using bean sprouts which maybe cheaper and really minimum agaric I only can find three piece in the meal, does make this meal really not good, I don't think I will come back again"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,9/24/16,"Delicious Chinese in Berlin. We had the dim sum and jelly fish for starters, then the kung pao chicken and duck for our main courses and the green tea with toasted rice to drink. All of it was very good, though we'll order it spicier next time. Highly recommended!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,8/30/16,The ubiquity of Chinese restaurants in every town I've been to dulls the senses a little towards what's going to be eaten. This place woke up my taste buds with dishes that were traditional but still new to me. It helped that I visited with some Chinese friends who ordered without really looking at the menu. I won't attempt to make any recommendations but needless to say everything we are was top notch and at a reasonable price. Recommended.
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,1/23/16,"I was seated quickly and the meal was brought about 5 minutes after ordering.  Had the sweet and sour chicken.  It was served different than what I am used to, but I enjoyed it.  Price was around 12 euros. Berliner tap beer was cold and awesome.The waiters did disappear for 45 minutes and I had trouble getting the bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,7/2/16,"This is a really good Chinese place in Berlin. We had a variety of dishes, and all of them were very good. I'm 1/2 Chinese. The Peking Duck was actually quite authentic, contrary to some reviews, and the Bok Choy, Hong Shao Qie Zi (?????soy sauce braised eggplant), and Kung Pao Chicken were all fantastic. The service was good as well. They have English menus upon request. Free shot of plum wine at the end of the meal was nice. I'd definitely come back here."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,2,7/3/15,"The food here is good, and they have a special menu for the hot summer, but the service is strange, and I feel bewildered and neglected. Maybe I'm too accustomed to dining in the US, I just wished when I sat down, someone could come over and ask me what I'd like to drink. But the waiter just left me with a menu and left. It took some time and work to get their attention when I wanted to order. Moreover, tips are included in the total amount on my bill, which my German friend told me is unusual and never heard of in Germany."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,9/29/14,"Tried this place last night because of briefly reading a few reviews and I was not impressed. Being on Chinese decent living in Vancouver Canada where we been told we have the best Chinese food outside of China. This place was a disappointment and I hate to say the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We had a few starters soup, dumplings, fried noodles etc. which was different I was jot impressed. Waiting for our main coarse Peking duck to arrive I was hopeful and excited by saying they can't mess this up unless they change the sauce... They did instead of the classic housin sauce I Dunno what they gave us but left a chalky aftertaste. Bill came to 76 Euros!Maybe my standards are high being from where I'm from but sorry this place is terrible. Don't say you haven't been warned."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,4,6/5/13,"One of the best Chinese joints I've been to in Europe.Dirt cheap and the food is great. The menu is authentic and bountiful including very good dim sum, szechuan specialties and of course Peking duck with pancakes.The duck was fairly moist and crispy. Everything else was fantastic. The eggplant in chili oil and garlic with cilantro was dreamy.I wanted to order the entire menu and actually look forward to going back next time I'm in Berlin!!Unfortunately, the service sucked, otherwise it would have deserved 5 stars!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,5,2/14/15,"It's one of those places made me wish there were more stars on Yelp reviews. Looks like a regular chinese place, but it's a gem. We tried lamb (don't know name showed picture in Yelp to order), duck with peanut souce, seaweed salad and dumplings. All excellent. Haven't eaten that good chinese in ages. Staff is nice and place is big and spacious too. They suggested wine with our food (no kidding), and I was surprised how it complimented food.PS to bad mouthing chinese: Yeah you can eat better chinese in China. Too bad it's a trillion hour flight."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,9/28/15,"this is probably the worst restaurant i've ever been to, anywhere in the world. this includes the taco bell that consistently made me sick as a kid....i've been in europe for almost 3 weeks now and was craving some chinese food, so found this place on yelp with 4 stars and 150 reviews, so figured it was a solid pick. we get there and are seated instantly (although we didnt have reservations, b/c they asked lol). it took a few minutes for our waitress but got drinks and food on order and waited. first up, XLB, because i have to eat XLB anywhere it is served (who doesn't?!). XLB was good but not soupy, but hey, it's germany, not shanghai or NYC. our entrees arrived and it's a bit weird. i ordered ""crispy fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce."" what i got was a fillet of fried chicken cut up, and then on top of it, another fillet of sesame encrusted chicken, also cut up. ok, that's cool i guess. then i get a bowl of sweet and sour sauce. this whole time, there's some fruit flies around, but when i pour out soy sauce (luckily on my plate b/c i wasn't sure if it was vinegar) there were *several* dead flies in it! holy smokes! my parents are with me and now aghast. the waitress that i told was like ""oh, yeah, ok ill get you a new one."" seems this is a known issue...my dad got crispy duck and noted that it wasn't good, like it had been reheated. after leaving and reading additional reviews it seems we're not alone in that thinking. we got our check and left, but noted they added service on the bill of around 8%. i spend quite a bit of time in europe and i've only seen that at high end places, not places like this. no one on the team ever asked how the meal was or seemed concerned we barely ate anything. quite a horrible experience."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,7/13/15,"Extremely unfriendly waiters. We sat down on the terrace and they tried to move us to another table because they didn't want to walk the extra couple of meters to serve us. When we said we prefer to stay at that table they said we need to move because of our pram with our one month old daughter (sleeping by the way, so no annoying crying etc) was in the way. We just left."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,3/29/15,"Food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy, bland, and came out cold. Also, their staff were some of the rudest servers I've ever encountered. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,1,11/7/15,"Food was extremely salty. I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but I had to send my mapo tofu back. I could not eat more than a spoonful. When I told the server I wanted to cancel my order (not replace it) he reacted with a confused frowning face saying 'I tasted it, it's not salty. It's normal '. At least when I reiterated that it was in fact salty and I didn't want it he took it away and I wasn't charged for it. I was however shocked to see that they had added a tip to our bill (around 10% if I remember right). I have not seen this so far anywhere else in my two weeks here in Berlin. This includes more upscale establishments and restaurants serving us as a party of 10 or more (we were only 4 at peking ente).As I side note, I understand that bottled water is part of the culture in Europe. But stating explicitly that you don't serve tap water and making the food this salty seems a big suspect."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4,?11-20,3,12/19/13,"5 stars??!!  Really?!  This place is overpriced and sub par.  While visiting berlin we relied in this restaurant's stellar yelp reviews to make a dinner choice. If this is the best that Berlin has to offer, I suggest replacing all meals with bread and beer. We specifically ordered the specialties of the house in order to get the most authentic experience possible. The meal was just the opposite.  The soup and dumplings were good but nothing to write home about. The perch was over salty and totally overpowered by it's heavy brown sauce, the sweet and sour chicken was lightly breaded but the sauce was equivalent any US takeout, ditto for the roast At 32 euros The Peking duck was a rip off so we didn't even bother. The interior was a little better than average but the neighborhood and building looked like the ghetto."
Mmaah,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,9/18/17,"Saved me like... 1000 times? Everything on the menu is worth trying. In summer, don't forget the melon ice cream."
Mmaah,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,2,5/11/17,"So disappointing.......The food was not worth the money.....the meat was tough and cheap quality and the salad not crispy"
Mmaah,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,4/2/16,"Though quite full already glad I just got in before the crowd. Packed now. Tucked inside a side street I think this will become quite popular. As described a Korean BBQ express. We were told it might take ten minutes but were served in five. The staff are friendly. Speak Korean, German, English and probably a few others   A compact but cool space with some seating inside and out. Being in a rush and panic ordering I ordered veggie mandu and hotgogi BBQ classic. Spicy chicken served an pillowy soft rice wth salad. I will definitely come again And have number 10. Which is half bulgogi and half hotgolgi on crispy roast potato slices. It got 4 stars based on it being a much tastier and healthier version of most fast food and Imbiss  joints. Will update later once I e had time to sample the rest of the menu...now have to .... Oh there's a friend of mine haha. Have to dash got to get some huge fluffy slippers."
Mmaah,Korean,3.5,Under ?10,4,5/25/17,Good place and foods. I personally prefer the dishes with rice and salad and the mandu kimchi
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/17/17,"This is my favorite pho place in Berlin. The portion is not too big, but the broth is very legit! I really like the meat ball in pho~Other rice dishes also good, especially the ribs!"
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,12/21/17,"I haven't written a review in years but felt compelled to write about this place. I must've eaten at a different restaurant considering all the rave reviews. Let me be clear- i didn't expect this pho to be like pho in Vietnam or an area with a large concentration of Vietnamese. Food was very bland, tiny portions and service was horrible. To be fair they are very understaffed and had a German boy running arround like crazy. I asked for water three times from 3 separate workers and was denied by the whom appeared to be the manager because normally they don't serve more than 2 super tiny glasses. I then asked for the check and sat there for 10 minutes- got really annoyed as I was dying of thirst and headed up front where I stood waiting again. I don't think this is an issue of the restaurant not wanting to offer quality service, just bad training and communication."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,7/28/17,"The Pho - Noodlebar is a very cozy and warmhearted Vietnamese restaurant with a young in Mitte, located close to the Ubahn station 'Oranienburger Tor'. It is a newly opened business specialized in the  traditional Vietnamese noodle soup 'Pho'.Food: The menu is rather compact and includes smaller finger food dishes, variations of the traditional Pho, some rice dishes and a dessert section. Even though, variety is not big, the dishes I tried are really authentic and delicious. Especially the smaller dishes and the Pho taste great, and are one of the best Phos in Berlin.The home made ice teas are worth to try - very tasty an refreshing. They use fresh herbs and great ingredients, such as lime, mint, lemongrass, etc. for the drinks. Service: A very young and attentive team.  The dishes are served quickly and always with a smile. :) Especially, the owner is really putting effort into her business and takes care personally of the comfort and enjoyment of her guests.Interior/Ambience: The restaurant has a nice outdoor space, where guests can enjoy their meals in the sun, but the interior inside the place is nicely decorated as well. It reminds of a traditional Vietnamese home and gives a warm and cozy impression. Price: The price range per person varies from 8-15 Euros. Even though, you can find cheaper places nearby, the quality and authenticity of the dishes are really high and therefore totally worth it. Most of the dishes are homemade and prepared with care, which you can taste! It is one of my favourite spots for Vietnamese food in Mitte, not only because it has great noodle soups and yummy small dishes, but also because it tastes very much like home ! Tip: It is a great place for lunch, a casual dinner  or just to grab something small of authentic Vietnamese food."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,12/27/17,"Quite horrible service. Consistently missed the orders on our table and the tables around us. Overheard a customer arguing over overcharged bill. Food was decent but the service made me wish I would have gone to another place."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,8/10/17,Best pho in Berlin! Had the pho chicken and it was amazingly fresh tasting. Broth ist delicious and noodles perfectly cooked. They also have vegan and vegetarian options
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/2/17,"Wow! Best food in town! You should definitely try one of the classics: noodle soup, banh bao burger or the curry. But also the daily specials are delicious! The staff is super friendly and the two owners are always open for a little chat about vietnamese food & culture."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,4,11/8/17,"Always a great spot for a quick lunch. The daily menu is on a chalkboard out front, and is usually the best option to get if you don't want to wait awhile. Friendly staff that is multilingual, I visit at least once a week."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,10/9/17,"After an extremely long day of travel, very late on a Monday night, we were desperately looking for something to eat. Delicious food. Friendly staff. Great service. We had duck curry, ribs, and three different types of Pho."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,6/16/17,A lovely and cozy Vietnamese Restaurant with delicious and very authentic food. My personal favorite was the pho and curry dishes. Their homemade ice teas are also refreshing. Thumbs up!
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,10/1/17,"We are from California, so maybe we just have high standards for good Pho and excellent customer service. This place lacks customer service, and they are cheap with giving you anything extra. Here are some examples. We asked for tap water and they gave us the smallest cups with maybe two gulps of water. When we asked for more, they said only the first cup of water is free and they would need to charge for more. I asked for a lemon wedge with my water and they would only give me one if I bought a bottle of still water, so I did. The lime was so tiny, almost non existent. Next, the pho comes in a smaller bowl, not like the kind you're used to in America. So you're paying more for less. Then, they gave us a tiny bowl filled with bean sprouts for 5 people. There were only enough to give to 3 of us, sparingly. We asked for more and they gave attitude and brought us back another small bowl filled with even less. Also, when they brought us the pho, they couldn't keep the order straight and brought wrong orders, which we sent back. At the end when the bill came, they tried to charge us for the bowls we didn't consume. The broth was tasty. The noodle used is a rice noodle normally used for pad thai back home, it's not what you expect if you've had pho in Cali. The terrible customer service alone, makes it not worth it for the five of us that went."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,4/26/17,"Loved this restaurant, the lady who seemed to be the manager or owner was very kind and helpful with my peanut/lentil allergy. She was so kind to my spouse and I. We talked about my state of California and how she went to school there for a semester. The food was great and the prices were very manageable. Definitely a recommendation to try. - very English speaking staff -"
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,2,7/1/17,"Yes it was tasty but it was a really small portion- like a small pho for the price of a large pho 8,5?. Normally it's like 6? and this is a small portion. In combination with long waiting time - skip it."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,3/16/17,"Very good restaurant, high quality services and food. I really enjoy the decoration. Well done."
PHO - Noodlebar,Vietnamese,4,Under ?10,5,8/3/17,this is probably the best pho I have ever had in Berlin. very authentic I will definity go back to here and dog friendly.

Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,9/21/17,"We love the barbecue. Best, fresh ingredients (meat from local known butchers ) and super side dishes and deserts. Friendly welcoming crew. We always come back and always enjoy the time and food here. Try the sweet potato fries. Amazing sauce comes along."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,11/7/17,"Me and my boyfriend found 2 hairs in our meal, one in the rice and another one in bbq plates. Taste is ok."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,8/2/15,"In a word - fun Korean bbq place with other cool tweaksLonger version (for the brave) - after a long wait, came here with Anne (our lovely CM) and Alex for a girls night outThis place is easy to miss if you don't look out as the sign (and the place) are rather small, or maybe it's just me daydreaming :)The decor inside is really nice and creates a rather cosy atmosphere.On to the menus - you have a choice of a ""proper"" dish or a bbq dish.. Yes, the one that comes with its own grill-by-yourself portion! Not only that, you get all these really cool appetizers and rice with as many refills as you'd like! So the choice was easy - bbq it is!We ordered the beef and the chicken.With the grill came a personal rice bowl, cucumber salad, kimchi, potatoes, cabbage and other goodies! Besides the fact it was lots of fun to grill on our own- the taste was great.The beef was tender and well seasoned!We also asked for some lettuce to make some ssambaps (hope I spelled it right)... And also, of course - some spicy sauce :)We wanted to start with some starter and thought about edamame but then we've noticed sweet potato fries - what a good choice it was! They were fried to perfection. Could've had another portion but I was already too full, how sad :(There was nothing left in the bbq, and after a few salad refills we were already too stuffed to move.After resting for a bit it was time to move on for something sweet - matcha panna cotta.It took us a while to feel the matcha as it was covered by a thick sweet red syrup.Even though it was a bit too sweet for me I really liked it, and it was the perfect ending for that meal.The service is great and the food was served rather quick, besides the dessert that took a little longer...The price is fair and you won't leave hungry :)"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,10/15/14,"I love bibimbap but at the same time I get really sad when a restaurant only serve them in super tiny mini portions like... come on... give me more! Juki is different. You can get a decent bowl of bibimbap with either chicken, beef or tofu. I decided for the tofu and was very pleased when a big bowl of sizzling rice arrived. It comes with two side dishes (kimchi and pickled cucumbers) and a spicy sauce. It was great so I think I'll be dropping by more often."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,2,12/28/15,"The service was far from good, had to ask few times to get extra salad and drinks. Chicken was tasteless, entrec?te (the most expensive thing in the menu) served frozen! At the end we still were hungry, which is rare when you're dining in Berlin.On the positive side is grilling on your own table, which is superfun."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,2/24/16,Authentic Korean food! Go there on a Tuesday and get a cheap all you can eat Korean BBQ. It's totally worth it. Staff was very friendly. The restaurant is very small so you might want to make a reservation before you come.
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,2,1/31/15,"Ordered 4 dishes for 4 people. We shared all of them. Still, when we asked for more rice they charged extra although the menu says we can order more for free. Reason they gave: because we shared.In addition the food was only OK. Very expensive for little food. Especially very small meat portions."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,2/8/16,"It's fun to do bbq on the table. A little bit pricey. It has the feeling of Korean fusion restaurant, so don't expect too much of the k-bbq dining experience"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,2/2/16,I love the bbq there.The food tastes great and service is good too.The side dishes are always filled up in abundance.
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,1,11/3/15,We were waiting an hour for our order while they were serving take away orders. Everytime we asked the answer was : you'll get your order soon.
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,5/15/15,"Great great great! Came here for take-out and it was hot and delicious. Waitress was friendly and it seemed like everyone dining in was enjoying their meals. I would like to go back on Thursday for their all you can eat deal. Got a soup here and it was light and filled with the most delicious wontons. Gave me a side of kimchi, too, for no cost!"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,3/29/15,"Great service and delicious food! The waiter was friendly, fast, gave us great service and we never had to wait too long for the extra side dishes. Defiantly a place I'll recommend and come back to!"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,3,12/26/13,"The service is very friendly and the drinks are great. Sadly the food is only okay.Since there are only few korean bbq restaurants we had to check this one out.I had better bibimpap but my main critique is that the bbq meat comes already served on the grill which can dry some meat quickly. It would be much better if they only serve 1 grill per 4 people and serve the raw meat on a platter. That makes a nicer experience and ensures always tender & fresh meat.PS: The service is so friendly that we actually got some noodles which can usually not be taken away."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,5/3/12,"Ich war mit meinen Freunden schon einpaar mal dort und es hat uns jedes Mal sehr gut geschmeckt. Beim letzten Besuch l?sten wir den Gutschein ein, den wir ?ber Dailydeal erworben hatten. Das Angebot war gro?z?gig, das Essen, wie ?blich, sehr gut. Wir haben sogar die Beilagen nachgef?llt bekommen. Die Inhaberin, die ?brigens auch im Service mitmacht, ist stets aufmerksam und zuvorkommend. All in allem  wir waren immer zufrieden und schauen bald wieder vorbei!"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,2/10/14,"We went here to eat dinner. The restaurant is nice and the waiters were nice as well. We ordered a starter and some dinner, which was prepared on a pan at our table. The food tasted really good and the dishes was not so expensive. About 8-10 euro for a main course, 4-5 euro for a starter and about 4-6 euro for drinks/beer. Worth a visit!"
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,5,5/6/11,"Friendly service,great food and amazing cocktails !

Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,3/29/14,"Nice little restaurant with friendly service, good atmosphere and nice food. The menu just lists a few dishes, we had some starters and bbq, both was great. Also not very expensive. We enjoyed it and will come back."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,4,6/28/13,"Sehr gutes Essen und freundliche Bedienung. Wir haben BBQ bestellt, sowohl das BBQ als auch die Beilagen sind super. Wir haben sogar eine Koreanische Freundin eingeladen. Ein Stern minus ist f?r das Maccha Eis. Es war Vanilla Eis und keinen Maccha. Die Kellnerin hat erkl?rt, dass der Mitarbeiter des Jukis das Eis mit dem Maccha Pulver selbst verr?hrt hat. Es gab auch Kunde, der das echte Maccha zu bitter findet, deswegen beretete er / sie Vanilla mit ein bisschen Maccha vor. F?r uns, die das echte Japanische Essen lieben, finden wir es echt Schade."
Juki,Korean,3.5,?11-20,2,8/10/11,"was there yesterday night, not very impressed as i am a die hard korean bbq addict.. the condiments were too few, meat was so-so, i guess i cant compare with most of the korean bbq restaurant i've tried in other parts of the world"
