Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-04-07,"Had a delightful meal here.  Authentic Italian staff prepared fresh homemade pasta dishes.  Decor was lovely.  Waiter was friendly and witty and provided good recommendations for unusual Italian red wines, including one from his home town, in charmingly accented German and English.  Wild truffle pasta initially appeared too plain, but actually had a delicious flavor.  Dinner for two including wine was under 50?."
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,2,2018-01-26,"Drawn here by the great reviews an hour before a Brecht performance at Berlin Ensemble a block away, we were looking forward to some authentic upmarket Italian food. The menu certainly does not disappoint. It is well-balanced between simple tourist-pleasing standards and elegant-sounding dishes trumpeting exotic ingredients with nouveau-riche enthusiasm, and wide-ranging, with pastas, antipastos, meats, and fish all solidly represented. Monkfish, bison entrecot, three kinds of seafood carpaccio.
The staff are attentive when you first arrive, seat you, take an oddly long time to read you the half-Italian, half-German menu in English, and take your drink order quite quickly, but at least on this Thursday at 7pm it would have been a good idea to order two drinks right away, because although the drinks arrived quickly, 15 minutes elapsed after they arrived while the waiter rushed around serving other tables. To his credit, he was fast, but for the number of tables, the restaurant is understaffed enough that the waiter has to avoid eye-contact with the new table for 15 minutes after getting them their initial drink order.
Once he finally showed at our table again, an honest and friendly exchange ensued where I voiced my concern, having by then 30m at best to finish a meal that had not yet started. The waiter proudly exclaimed that everything took a loong time to come out of the kitchen because it's all so amazingly fresh, (including the cheese and brined olives??,) so we cashed out.
Still curious to try a sampling of their cuisine, we asked what time they close, and the waiter said: ""don't worry. We're open 'till midnight!"". It would have been considerate after we mentioned that we would then return at 11 to tell us that ""open 'till midnight"" is only on Fridays, not this evening...
Returning at 11 and walking through an open front door we were met by a judgy man admonishing us that it was closed (ever think of closing the front door, then?) - Let's just say we'll be happy to live without further adventures in Boccondivino customer service..."
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-04-02,Amazing and unique variety of dishes in a very authentic Italian restaurant unlike others in the area
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-01-07,"Just saw a review ""This is my favorite Sicilian restaurant in Berlin. They make a great pizza but the kitchen really shines with the seafood dishes."" I am surprised - no pizza on the menu. It's not a pizzeria, it's a very nice italian ristorante - and the six of us all had different starters and entrees and were very happy. I will sure go there again."
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-06-06,"My friend and I were in Berlin for just a couple of days, and so far we have not been especially impressed with the food options. This place seemed nice when we walked by it during the day, so we stopped in for dinner at around 9:30 on a Monday night.

It was pretty busy, and they didn't have a hostess per say, so we sort of asked the bartender to be seated. It took about 10-15 min for someone to get to the table, but they were very nice. Just slow. The menu was on the chalkboard, as was the wine. I ordered a red wine for 7 euros, awful but cheap. Then we ordered food. Bread came - it was not great bread. Food came fast, I had mushroom risotto and my friend had a truffle and cheese pasta. They were both pretty good, but not excellent. Then it took another 25 min after we finished eating to get the check.

Overall, decent food (especially for the price), and they were very nice, but not attentive."
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-05-25,"I'm not sure if the people leaving good reviews here are real or not. After enduring 16hours of flight from Singapore to Berlin, I wanted to finally have nice food in a nice environment. Since reviews are all good on Foursquare, Tripadvisor, Google, my friends and I decided to give this place a shot for lunch. We ordered ricotta and spinach cannelloni, with vegetable and beet soup, and I ordered some kind of pasta with shrimps and lobster sauce.

1) We were served bread and olives. I wonder what happened to the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
2) The waiter was always hovering around and eavesdropping. Or maybe seeking validation or hoping that we're gonna go all ""oh wow awesome food"" (which didn't happen).
3) The cannelloni with ricotta and spinach was bland. But it was slightly better than my dishful of hate pasta.
4) My pasta (the shrimp with lobster sauce) was obviously cooked with hate. The shrimps were made from frozen, it was bland and texture was meh. The sauce? I didn't taste any lobster, instead all I had was salt and huge chunks of garlic. A vampire would have fled in horror if he saw the chunks of garlic in my pasta. Even my boyfriend thought that maybe they heard that I mention that the soup tastes home-made, and as a result, they probably cooked me a dishful of hate.

So God knows where all these good reviews came from. Is it because they hate life, or just hate asians, or hate non-italians, or is it because we aren't the usual demographic of the fancy Mitte business people, that we don't deserve a good meal even though we're paying for it? I would not recommend this place at all to anyone who wants to. Spend your money elsewhere, in a restaurant that takes pride in serving good food to people.

Visited May 2015"
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-11-16,Very authentic Italian restaurant and reasonably priced. Grilled fish with potatoes and spinach reminded me of a meal in Venice. Pasta with beef filet was delicious. The pasta Alfredo ordered by a neighboring table was prepared in a very unique way and looked great!
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2013-03-14,"Great authentic atmosphere, not commercialised in any way.  Fely like being in Italy.  Great food, reasonable prices and the wine selection was also good and good value"
Boccondivino,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2012-09-13,"This is my favorite Sicilian restaurant in Berlin. They make a great pizza but the kitchen really shines with the seafood dishes. The portions are large and delicious, the salads are great. The wine list has great wines in all price ranges. The staff is friendly and efficient. Checkout the chalkboard above the bar for the daily specials based on what is fresh."
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-10-12,"The best hospitality I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Mario - one of the brothers who runs this place is such a pleasant person. When his brother is cooking he talks to each and every guest and takes his time taking orders and serving. After his brother leaves he takes over and serves the food as well. The food was so good. He offered a desert wine and espresso at the end. Visiting this place was the highlight of my trip to Berlin. Mario even walked every guest to the door after they finished while we were there. Eat at this place to have a pleasant time, if you are in a hurry and want to be on your phone this is not the place. I like how the restaurant tries to keep technology out while we enjoy our meal."
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-12-29,Considering price and quality you will have a great evening here. Homemade food and great friendly service.  Anti past can be shared and the prosecco does the trick.
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-05-16,"Excellent supper. From the beginning you feel welcome and appreciated. The server runs the place with his brother, and it's clearly something they really believe in. We had gnocchi and a pasta dish, along with a mozzarella/tomato appetizer, and some wine. All the food was exactly what I'd want for that dish. The prices were very good, with the main dish prices low enough that you feel like getting that appetizer or two. All the ingredients that are supposed to be fresh were fresh and delicious. What else is there to say?"
Dolcini,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2013-05-13,Also ich finde das Essen nichts Besonderes Italiener hat keine Pizza und Penne war nicht herausragend Nur wenn ich muss wieder
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-12-17,"Family-style Italian restaurant with a great selection of pizza, pasta, salads, and antipasti. Simple, hearty food for a cozy dining experience. A nice selection of house wines, too. 

This isn't fine dining, and that's just fine with me. Simply good food for a good price. 

The owner/proprietor is an extremely welcoming and friendly woman. Makes you feel like you're always welcome. Highly recommended!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-09-15,"After HOURS of researching the perfect place for our final meal on our Berlin trip, I came across Marechiaro. We were looking for something non-German, quaint, and in a less busy neighborhood, yet somewhere cozy that had great food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. I think this place fit the bill nicely! It was a nice night out and many people showed up to the restaurant wanting an outdoor table, so the employees took almost all of the tables out to the sidewalk to appease everyone. My wife and I stayed inside, though.

The proprietors were super helpful. The menu and specials were all in German and they translated everything for us without a fuss. As we came to experience in Berlin, service in general is just slower than in the US. But this was the only place we ate where they acknowledged and apologized for the wait, which was nice.

The food was freshly prepared and we agreed our entrees and appetizer were great. If they are serving it, I'd recommend the spaghetti with lemon cream sauce and tiger shrimp."
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-04-19,"Perfect food, very good service
We enjoyed every moment.
We ate bruschetta and two kinds of pasta and the taste was amazing!!!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-03-31,"went with 3 friends, none of spoke Italian nor German. Didn't matter!  The owner was adorable. She made us feel welcome. best Italian food outside Italy!  Go and have dinner. You won't be sorry."
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-11-14,"Maybe a bit slow,
But really the best Italian food with fresh ingredients, awesome pizza and pasta. Every ingredient is delicious !!!"
Marechiaro,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2012-12-08,It is a small eatery with fine pizzas. the service here was very friendly and the food served was fresh.
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,5,2011-09-25,"The best thing about an Italian restaurant is always the atmosphere 

In this restaurant run by Salvatore and Felix this is sure to receive. The food is made with the with Italian love for food.

Suggest you all put on your list to go to when in Prenzlauer Berg."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,2,2015-12-02,"Wandering around Berlin I came just to Trattoria Felice.

With a pure heart I can say that for the first time in Berlin I found a great waitress who likes his job because, clearly, it can be seen and knows savavr vivre.

The place is friendly animals. The dog got even water and dog cookies.

Let's get to the menu. Prices very high. I could not find my taste pizza, firmly contrived. Everything looks appetizing, but the pizza does not impress.

We have spent more than 30 euros and we were disappointed, because we could eat much better for this money."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-01-18,"I love this place. Beautiful interior design, great service and morst importantly: wonderful food and drinks. Had a vegetarian pizza, a salad and white wine. Will be back!"
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,1,2016-02-14,"Food is not good at all, the speed of cooking is too soon. I think everything is all made up not home made, I am wondering how they got all these stars."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,4,2015-04-03,"We got a table without reservation, but the place was completely packed, noisy and chaotic. What I like about this Italian restaurant is that they also serve non-pizza and pasta dishes, like the meats and fishes you'd also expect in Italy. Nevertheless we decided to stick to pizza, because it was so warm and crowded that we did not want to stay too long, also the meat dishes were slightly too expensive for our taste (24 euros or so) and therefore not suitable for a 'quick bite'. 
Negative thing was that the counter with cash register was next to our table and as a result the waiters were continuously yelling close to my girlfriends ears to communicate with each other over all the inside noise, which was quite annoying. This got worse when some live music entertainment started,  so although the music was great we were too bothered and annoyed by the (nonetheless) friendly waiters.

The pizzas were good though - a bit undercooked and too salty, but nice and thin, good ingredients and richly covered.

Four stars because all the food we saw looked great and we know that the experience would've been better on any other night than this one. We'll come back on a weekday to get this confirmed."
Trattoria Felice,Modern European,4.0,?11-20,3,2012-07-18,"Not bad, not all that great  
The pasta dish with Parmesan and truffle was really outstanding, but the overall atmosphere wasn't all that great. I like it when an Italian restaurant can make me feel like being in Italy  here you know you're in an Italian place in Germany. Also while serving us, the owner had more of an eye for new customers coming in, than concentrating on who he was serving.
Whoever is used to a pizzeria thinks this is great, if you expect somewhat more it was a bit disappointing.
Nice food but I would not come back again soon. 3,5 stars"
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-17,"Such a cute little place.

The food is amazing (and cheap too), the staff is lovely and accommodating and the atmosphere is amazing.

I'd go back anytime."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,2014-09-18,"Oh boy did yelp steer me in the wrong direction with this place! People gave this restaurant 4/5 stars so i thought It would be great italian food and It was not. Staff was very nice and friendly. 

Frankly they had nothing really italian on their menu. No typical pasta dishes, no chicken parmagiana. No chicken marsala, no pesto sauce, no penne vodka. It is like this place had no clue what italian food was or how to serve it.   Sad that these servers were so good, yet working at a crap place like this.

I ended up ordering 'homemade' gnocchi with homemade tomato basil sauce, it was bland, not very good at all. My dad tried to order chicken parm over pasta and got pieces of grilled chicken tossed in spaghetti from a box over the same plain tomato sauce.  How awful.

Their wine selection was pathetic, strange considering its an ""italian restaurant...?'  The server could not even tell me what the ""Sweet wine"" on the menu was. Yes that was its actually called on the menu. They only had three also...pinot, chardonnay, and 'sweet wine.'  Awful selection for any restaurant let alone an Italian one.

Overall I would never come back here, I would never suggest it to anyone, and shame on anyone giving this place more then three stars. For what????????? Their food sucks, their menu is not even Italian, and they have no real alcohol. basically the only thing good here were the servers!"
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-07-22,"Nice, authentic italian place. We came on a busy friday, but managed to get at table indoor. Had a lovely dish of tagliatelle and a beer, and everything was well made and tasty."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-08-30,"Very nice food and service, traditional italian cuisine! We liked it and we are going to come back there soon."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-15,"Delicious food, huge portions, extremely reasonable prices, complementary bruschetta, uplifting atmosphere, and very friendly staff!  We had a great dinner here!  We got the simple lasagna and the spaghetti with meat sauce, and both were so good that we switched meals halfway through and still only finished about half of each plate...not to mention that each plate was only 7?-8?...that's a steal!  The staff were all very gracious and didn't even seem to mind that we didn't speak German (or Italian).  Highly recommended.  :)"
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-03-16,"When you're in the mood for spaghetti, go here. The servers are characters and we love them. Pizza is good. House red is decent. And it's super cheap. Nice little digestif offered on the house after the meal. Happy to have this go-to in the neighborhood."
Osteria dell ?Arte,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2012-10-16,"When I visited this place it was packed. Seems like a good idea to make reservation beforehand. There is a menu, which did not impress me at all, but the waiter suggested some seasonal dishes which were very nice. The desserts are absolutely awesome."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2018-01-03,"Our experience here was 5 stars from start to finish.  The service was amazing, our waiter was both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu.  

We had a group of 3 and all tried different items.  The gnocci was perfectly done, one of the best I have ever had (including in Italy).  The prices seemed very fair for the level of quality and service provided."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-11-04,"Went to Ristorante a Mano without reservations on a Wednesday night. They were pretty full, however we were able to snag a table for 2. After ordering drinks, another party of 4 came in and out waiter asked us if it was possible for us to move to an alternate table so they could combine two tables together to accommodate the table of 4. We had no problem doing this, and we moved. Our waiter then informed us that we could have another round of drinks on the house as a thank you! 

They served complimentary bread, sliced meat and the BEST OLIVES I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered a tagliatelle dish (don't remember what was in it) and I had the penne arrabbiata. Both were delicious, the arrabbiata had onions and peppers inside that added different textures to the pasta. They even served complimentary shots of limoncello or sambuca, as well as a little baggie of MyTaxi sponsored gummies (lol). 

Overall, I recommend this restaurant! Nice ambiance inside, extremely accommodating and kind waiters."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-10-01,"My family and I recently took a trip to Berlin. After a couple days of doner, sausages, etc., we were jonesing for some good Italian food. After cross-referencing results between Yelp and Trip Advisor, we decided on Ristorante a Mano, one of the highest-rated restaurants in the area with a ton of reviews. 

On the way, we were hoping that we weren't dressed too casually for the location. Upon getting there, our attire was no problem, and the waitstaff was incredibly friendly. We did not have a reservation, but that was no problem as we were immediately seated outside. I think it is accurate to say the waiters *rushed* to prepare our table. As we were seated, we promptly received bread as well as blankets to keep us warm. Our main waiter was Rosano (?), and he was very attentive, helpful, funny, and helpful. Honestly, he has set the bar for descriptions of service for my future yelp reviews. 

We ordered the burrata appetizer, which packed a lot of flavor. Between the four of us, we ordered a chicken/mushroom pasta, a pesto gnocchi, a truffle ravioli (!!!!!), and a spaghetti and meatballs. All were rich with bold flavors. Maybe it's because we're from a couple of college towns in Florida, but we all thought the food was superb. 

I have to devote a separate paragraph to the dessert. I think the general consensus among my family was that this was the best dessert we had ever had. Rosano talked us into the dessert sampler, and I wish I remembered better what exactly it consisted of. There was a moist tiramisu, a mango panna cotta, a pistachio ice cream (the best one there), and..... something else that I know was amazing but I forget what it was. 

Afterwards, Rosano gave us complimentary drinks and called us a cab home. Overall, this was an 11/10 experience, and I will be recommending this place to any of my friends who are lucky enough to be in Berlin."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-12-31,Was by far the most reasonable price restaurant and best tasting meal since in Germany. Waiter service was super and establishment was very clean.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-07-15,"We came here after a quick decision for good Italian food. We did not have reservations, but were given seats immediately though our group of 6 had to be split up into tables of 4 and 2 (bigger groups can be accomodated outside, but it was cold).

One of the first things I noticed was how good the service was. The waiters were all very attentive. We were served bread w/olive oil and vinegar for free upon sitting down and they got our orders quickly.

I shared a cream of potato soup with truffle oil, a mixed salad with a sort of balsamic vinaigrette and beef fillet, and a spaghetti with garlic, prawns, and chili. The soup was delicious, though a bit on the salty side. The salad was alright, and the pasta was really good. And apparently there was one spaghetti in my friend's sea of penne. Overall, I would say this was a solid place for Italian food and I had nothing to complain about, but it was nothing too stellar."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-04-07,I was blown away by this place. We walked in and were lucky enough to grab a table. Intimate atmosphere. Waitstaff is friendly and accommodating. Ordered buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for appetizer. I fell in love with my entree of gnocchi with truffle butter. Would not hesitate to visit today and order again. A must for homemade Italian.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-05-05,Great little Italian spot.. easy train ride. GREAT service. Food was very good. Maybe not great though since I wasn't a fan of The calamari. It's prob just me being ignorant American though. Calamari came whole and unbreaded which I'm. It used to. Thanks for the sambuca though at the end of dinner.
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-03-02,"This restaurant was one of the culinary highlights while on a recent visit to Berlin. We tried it since it came up in a web search as the #1 highest rated/most reviewed restaurant on TripAdvisor and because of Germany's close proximity to Italy being just over the Alps. Sure enough the restaurant had an authentic Italian staff, the food was fantastic and the price was completely reasonable. A burrata appetizer, two half little carafes of red wine, a lamb chop entree and a smoked salmon lasagna entree all came in at around 70?. When we sat down at the table they brought us bread and a little spicy olive salad which tasted just like Sicilian olive salad that my grandfather used to make -- this place is a must of in Berlin. Probably best to make a reservation."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,2016-05-22,"Don't come here if you're looking for Italian. The waiters are extremely rude and pretentious. I didn't order a starter and they looked at me with disgust. I brought my own bottle of water (portable branded bottle) and they asked me to keep it as if they were disgusted and forced me to order a drink. 

I will never recommend. Look for another place to eat dinner and have a better time in Berlin. I wish I never went."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-06-07,"Our apartment in Berlin was above this restaurant and we decided to have dinner here one night when we wanted to take it easy. We got a table easily without a booking, and they even moved us from a table in the middle of the restaurant to a more intimate table which was nice. 

For starter we shared the antipasti platter between us which was a nice selection of grilled vegetables, meats and cheese. We'd also been given a bowl of olives and breads so it was a nice start to the meal. For main, I had the pasta with artichoke and prawn. It was perfectly fine although I much preferred it with Parmesan which took a little while to arrive. It had a generous amount of prawns and was a really tasty dish. 

We shared a couple of 500ml carafes of wine between the two of us, and I think the bill was around ?60. Service was really warm and friendly, and I thought our waiter was really nice. I'm not sure I'd recommend heading out of your way to go here as it wasn't anything overly special but it was perfect for us staying so close."
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-01-14,"Great Staff & Food! Highly recommended for pizza, truffles and all in between. Come here once and you'll come there often. Don't go there when you're on a diet though :) true Italian cusine as you otherwise know it only from Italy"
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-22,"I can highly recommend that place for all who are looking for a good Italian meal and a nice environment.
We went there on my birthday during our Berlintrip. We looked for something romantic and we are both love Italian food.
Our dishes were good. Not something very fancy but it tasted like you would expect it.
The service was awesome. Super friendly and attentive!
We will definitely visit this place again!"
Ristorante a Mano,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-04-07,"I'm on holiday in Berlin and was looking for somewhere nice but not too pricey for dinner. I'm very glad we chose this place! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly. They seemed to know many other customers very well, which suggests that there are regulars. I can see why! We had soups to start - both the tomato and the vegetable soups were delicious. I then had pork with porcini mushrooms and my boyfriend had steak. Both were delicious, although I did get food envy watching my boyf tuck into his wonderful steak! 

The wine was very tasty and we were served appetisers of bread and meats, and grapes at the end of the meal, which was a nice touch. 

The service was friendly and not intrusive. They would basically leave you alone until you ask them for something, at which point they can't do enough.

At the end, the bill was very reasonable. We spent ?60 on two starters, two mains, wine, water, orange juice and a 20% tip. 

Highly recommended for very reasonably priced, good food and lovely service."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-09-18,"First dinner in Berlin...spectacular!! 
Service? Awesome... one gal took care of everyone perfectly well.  
Ambiance? Amazing... just like being in Italy! Food?...I mean...Out of this world!
We had the fettuccine with veal, chanterelles &... wait for it...FRESH TRUFFLES! OMG! An absolute flavor explosion!!!! Hubby had linguine with parmesan butter sauce and...FRESH TRUFFLES! 
Super yummy fresh bread... smooth spectacular panna cotta...and the best Chianti I've ever had.  A lovely little place...a real treat. GO!!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2015-05-15,"I may be a little picky with my pasta but I was NOT super satisfied with my meal here. The atmosphere is pretty good and the fact that it is family owned and has FREE water is nice but aside from that and the appetizer I got (proscuitto and melon) I felt this place could have been a lot better.

I got some of their handmade pasta (the one with mushrooms) and it was very lacking in the flavor department and the mushrooms were so small I could barely get them on the fork. It was very creamy and I felt like something green was missing... maybe some other vegetables? I don't know. My friend got pasta with shrimp and she said the shrimp was a bit dry and her pasta was slightly cold. Mine was steaming so I am guessing they waited for my food to be ready and hers ended up cooling while it waited. We got apple shorle and juice which is pretty inexpensive for the glass they give you.

The waitress was busy and un-attentive and seemed stressed and agitated at times. I don't know if it was a bad night at the place because this it seems to have great reviews from a lot of people but I was just a bit disappointed and have no plans on returning. Wish everything else was as great as the proscuitto melon was."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-12-10,"This little Italian joint looks rather unassuming, but don't be fooled. I'd been craving home-made ravioli for a few weeks and when my lovely suggested this joint, I was stoked at the coincidence.  And boy, this ravioli was STUNNING!  With spinach sheets of pasta on one side, and regular on the other, they were just little pillows of orgasmic delight. 
Drenched in butter and sage, with a sprinkling of parmesan (oh man, my mouth is watering just at the memory again!) I almost couldn't finish the plate, I was savouring each morsel so slowly...
And as a bonus, the staff are cute, and authentically Italian - I'd happily have come back day after day ;)"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-01-07,"This is an amazing little Italian gem in Berlin! I lived in Italy for about 6 months and this food is up there with some of my favorites in Rome and Florence. 

We started with the anti pasta and it was great! Fresh cheese and salami and prosciutto and in season veggies! Absolutely perfect. 

I ordered the carbonara...I usually never order creamy pasta but this carbonara is off the charts. It's traditional, the pasta was cooked perfectly with the egg and prosciutto. It wasn't too heavy or creamy because they didn't have to add cream because the egg did it for them. I don't think I've had carbonara better! I highly recommend it!! 

My friend ordered the spinach ravioli and she is Italian and very particular about pasta and she was also in heaven. The pasta was fresh the dough was light and the spinach just made the ravioli a delight. 

Overall a great atmosphere, good service  and great find. If you're in Berlin and you're craving great Italian food this is the place to go.  I wish I lived closer because i would become a regular."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2016-09-06,Mediocre place at best. Appearance and taste wise. We had the tagliatelle with truffles and the pasta Siciliana. Both were not flavorful and made without love. Would not recommend as you can find much better in the area.
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-12-13,"The food is delicious. No matter if you're, like me, not a great fan of Italian food, this is crazy delicious. And those tiny portion will make you full but still craving for more. I'm amazed of the quality. 

It's very tiny, so better reserve a table. 

The service is ok, it's more of a ""family/friends""-hospitality. Not that stuck in norms, they are friendly and nice. Although they could work out a smile once in a while. 

The rock classics playlist is not expected at a place like this, but it works well, it brings you in the mood. But why I wouldn't go all the way to a 5th star is that the music was...extremely loud...as I was there. And it wouldn't get any lower as the evening progressed.."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-08-10,"We found this restaurant by chance and it was fantastic! Some of the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy. I visited in the summer and sat on their patio. Almost all of the tables were full but they were quick to clean the tables when someone left so it helped with turnover. The menu came in English and German, making it easy as a tourist to order (even though this was off the beaten path to find to some degree). 

They offered a wide variety of pasta dishes, I went for the pasta with chanterelle mushrooms and it was really good. Served with more of a tomato sauce instead of a creamy alfredo type sauce that I was expected. I was pleasantly surprised. They brought bread at the beginning of the meal and provided us free water. The service was good when we needed something but otherwise gave us space which was also appreciated. 

I definitely plan to go back next time I'm in Berlin!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-03-16,"Def a 5 star candidate.
The food was amazing, the wines so so tasty, the servers really nice and quick and the atmosphere is so Italian style. I love. Love. Love."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-24,"This place was a bit empty at 6:30, when we arrived, and we were a bit worried that it wouldn't be as good as we thought. But the waiter was really friendly and we got served really quickly since we were pretty much the only ones there. It filled up soon enough and was getting busy by the time we left. They brought us olives and fresh hot bread which were both great. I had the spaghetti bolognese and my mum had ravioli and both our dishes were AMAZING. Very flavourful, the spaghetti was perfectly cooked. The portions were really generous, we were very full by the end of the meal. Overall great meal!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-10,"OMG Berlin ... aMaZiNg, really ... Quaint, delish, friendly and romantic!  The food was fabulous, the service was suggestive and helpful, the ambiance exceeded all expectations.  2 Americans, a bottle of wine, casual yet sensual~

La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-03-23,Excellent choice for my husbands birthday dinner.  The perfect blend of authentic charming atmosphere and exceptional food.  We highly recommend the antipasti and ravioli marscapone.  The chianti reserve was a nice compliment in flavor and price!  We will return again during our stay in Berlin.
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-12-22,"My favorite Italian restaurant in Berlin.
You feel like in Italia. The prices are very cheap for the neighborhood. The best dishes are for me the ravioli.
The service are very nice with a nice italian accent ;)"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-07-08,"This is a small restaurant on Torstrasse. They offer a good choice of italian pasta dishes. We went for the 2 daily specials, pasta with truffles and pasta with scampi. Both dishes were good, but not great. They somehow lacked a bit of bold flavours and left us a little disappointed. The prices for the regular pasta are very good, around 6 EUR, the daily specials were considerably more expensive around 15 EUR. Given the ingredients this is ok. I will go back there and try the anti pasti plates, they looked delicious."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-10-02,"This is  a cozy original italian food trattoria...much better than many restaurants you could find now a days in Rome, believe me! 
They have great options for lunch menus. Their dishes are very authentic, original, and simple with great quality ingredients. 
I've been there for lunch and dinner. For lunch I had the spaghettis with sausage and tomato sauce...delicious! They totally nailed it!
For dinner I had the spaghetti carbonara with truffle oil, it was creamy without being too overwhelming, just perfect! 
Recommended!"
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-01-08,"This was the best Italian meal I've eaten outside of Italy.  I was blown away.  The service,  atmosphere,  wine,  and food were all first rate. I wish I lived in Berlin,  or at least close by,  so I could enjoy it again.  The next time I cross the country to visit Berlin, this will be a stop.  I recommend a reservation for dinner, as this little place filled quickly.  Luckily we made one for my birthday and I'm so pleased we did."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2014-11-17,"Bedienung sehr nett, Pasta ist wahnsinnig lecker. Leider alles ein bisschen eng und klein, aber die Qualit?t stimmt und es lohnt sich hier einen netten Abend zu verbringen."
La Galleria Italiana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2011-06-02,"Really good pastas and antipasti. Some of the best Italian food I've eaten in Europe, including Italy."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-08-02,"This is our 3rd time here. Food always excellent. Served with FRESH HOt bread with a slight crisp to it. Great wine selections by the glass and bottle. Tonight, we started with the Caesar salad. A must if you like Caesar fresh made croutons as well. Entres, Handmade tortellini stuffed with braised short ribs, and  creamy white sauce, perfect al dente. Hubby had smocked salmon stuffed ravioli with shrimp and cherry tomatoes, very tasty. Had to skip dessert, as we are stuffed. They don't scrimp. Our server Chris brought us a tiny treat anyway. 

They serve espresso, but we are going up the street to  Piccola Trattoria  for an espresso, so Luca doesn't feel bad we've been cheating on him over here  at Osteria Caruso.

BTW the deco in here is  a major improvement. Service is always spot on, well attended, and food served HOT."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-08-04,"Lovely Italian restaurant. 

We ordered Minestrone, carbonara and the mushroom ravioli. 

My order of pasta Carbonara was not like the one I a used to. Egg yolks were fluffy and not incorporated, usually it happens when eggs were added to the hot dish without tempering. Pasta was al dente.

Mushroom Raviolli was my favorite. 

They do charge 2,50 euro for the tap water. It's unisual for me.

Also service was very Italian - slow, and not really paying attention to us. Had to ask for the bill three times. And it's the worst, you know? When you are ready leave but stuck at the table. 

Tiramisu had way to much sponge and not enough cream filling. We were compensating it with the side whipped cream."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-07-16,"Well cooked. Home made. Delicious. Great service. Found this local gem through Yelp. 
I had the house specialty tortello with basil pesto. It was well cooked and absolutely delicious; not too heavy as I sometimes find pasta dishes to be. The pesto too was really well balanced; No garlic taste overshadowing the taste of basil. 
For dessert I had their home made tiramisu. I'm not lying when I say it was the best tiramisu I've ever had! It was light, fluffy and well balanced - I could've kept eating the entire pan! 
Although I would DEFINITELY recommend the Tiramisu, I'd also recommend trying their wine foam  (made from masala liqueur and egg whites) w vanilla ice cream - I've never tasted anything like it! The foam is a bit warm as it is heated to create the foam - along with the cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce sprinkled on the sides of the glass, it makes for at perfectly light and delicious dessert!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,2,2017-01-28,"A total flop. The food was delicious but the service was astoundingly bad.

We were seated at 19:15, and at first it went well. We put in our order within ~10 minutes, and the appetizer was out in another 10. Then came the wait. The long, slow, agonizing wait. Our entrees arrived at 20:30 -- a full HOUR after we had ordered them. Someone had clearly forgotten us, because in the meantime a couple had been seated next to us, ordered, and had their food come out while we were still waiting on ours. 

When the waiter finally brought us our food, it had been sitting out for a while. The plate and edges of the food were cold. I hoped the waiter would have noticed his mistake, but that was too optimistic. We shrugged it off and enjoyed the dinner -- the food was actually pretty good (the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1). But it didn't take long for the bad service to return. We ordered dessert and coffee, and it's another half hour wait. 30 minutes for a cup of coffee? C'mon. 

Finally we ask to pay, and you can guess what happened. We watched in astonishment over the next 15 minutes as our server gave literally everyone else in the restaurant their checks without giving us ours. We were now the last people there, and I had already stood up and put on my coat. It was like something out of a British comedy or prank show -- ""How long will they wait around to pay while the restaurant closes? Find out after these commercials!""

I was about to walk out, figuring that if they really want my money they'll suddenly give us the check we asked for, but my wife insisted we ask again. ?85 for this fiasco. We walked out of the place at 22:00, nearly 3 hours after starting. I like to eat a slow dinner, but that's ridiculous. (And it wasn't a cultural difference -- I understand that in Germany, waiters leave you alone until you call them. At every turn our requests were explicitly ignored or forgotten.)

Ever since I moved here, I've known Berlin as a world-class city with many fantastic food options. For Italian alone there are a number of other places who's food is just as good and whose service is not embarrassingly slow. I suggest you take your business to one of them."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,4,2017-07-02,"A bit overpriced, but worth it as the food was delicious and pleasant service. Come on an empty  stomach, as the portions are quite large!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-03-20,"WARNING: The portions of food are huge at Osteria Caruso. I ordered the minestrone soup as an appetizer, but it really could have been my main course. As my actual main course, I enjoyed a PENNE ALL'ARRABBIATA, spicy in all the right ways. Knowing how large the servings are, you really get the bang out of your buck in this Italian joint. The waitress was a true Italian and very friendly. A perfect place for a lunch or restaurant date with friends."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-11-07,"Gorgeous! Friendly and helpful wait staff, delicious and we'll prepared dishes, and a free shot of limoncello; a perfect evening."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2014-05-28,"Absolutely great experience! Atmosphere made me feel like I was in Italy again.  Food was great, service was awesome.  Server was owners son & couldn't have been more friendly, personable & helpful.  English, Italian & German languages, no problem.

We all shared a bresaola salad, a caprese salad, 3 pasta dishes & 2 desserts.  I forgot I was in Berlin.

We are a flight crew in private aviation & travel the world, so we know a totally great experience when we go to a great restaurant.  (I'm a true foodie!) Definitely a treat in Germany when you get tired of bier & weiner schnitzel!  (Not that there's anything wrong with that)!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-01-17,"Wonderful hardly describes this restaurant. Everything about it was great. Off the beaten path, away from the tourist traps, reasonable prices, good portion sizes, fresh ingredients, friendly and patient staff. Very popular with locals. Parking on the street is tough but it is located about 2 blocks from Potsdamer Platz metro station. Great traditional dishes from all regions of Italy. My wife and I liked it so much we went back the next night. We tried soups, pizza, beef and pasta dishes; all were as good or better than any of the touristy spots you'll find in Berlin. Reservations are strongly recommended. This place is so warm and inviting it's like your having dinner at a relative's house. If I'm ever back in Berlin, I will certainly go again."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-06-28,"Wonderful experience! The food was delicious and the service was excellent.   We had the Pecorino salad, spaghetti alla carbonara and homemade ravioli and they did not disappoint.  If you are looking for great Italian food and great service, definitely try this place out!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-03-16,My husband is both Italian and a chef.  I consider myself a good judge of Italian food.  This place is FANTASTIC!!!!
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2015-02-01,"Decent pizza and nice homey ambiance,  good option near potsdamer platz. Lots of families."
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2012-04-30,My second time at this restaurant. A family friendly and realistic decorated place. The prices are ok and the service is as expected. But if you look for a very good italian pizza you should look somewhere else. The pasta is good though and they have a nice selection of wines.
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-08-19,"Awesome place near Potzdamer platz. Great atmosphere, excellent food. Service was really friendly. Our family had appetizers, pasta, pizza and steak, all were very good! A must try!"
Osteria Caruso,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-06-28,Had an wonderful dinner.  Me and my girlfriend were truly wowed by everything from the antipasto to the entrees and also the wine.
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-09-27,"Service was friendly and good. The food was excellent.  We had Pizza, spaghetti carbonara and also spaghetti bolonase. All were very good. 

I strongly recommend you try it."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2017-07-30,"A bit cheesy. The waiters were a bit cheesy with their Italian speak and behavior. Food (pizza) was decent but not outstanding

An experience that can be repeated, but do not expect ""out of this world"" pizza"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-05-09,"Great italians servers! Happy people.
Awesome food! Felt like if i was in Italy. Enjoy!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-05-31,"From having tried pizza all over the world, Luardi's is really on top of their game. The pizza was chewy and crispy just like in Naples.
Well done!!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2016-11-28,"Nothing to write home about. Small Italian place, like many other in Berlin. The place was crowded even Monday evening, most probably because of reasonable prices (25 euro per person with wine). But food quality was very debatable. Carpaccio has been served with very strange sauce, Parmesan and rucola (!). Fish was bearable, but one potato and cooked carrot did not fit the dish at all. And again rucola! Why? My companions got a soup and chicken, which did not impress either. So all in all rather one time experience."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-07-01,"Great food, great service!
On top we didn't have to wait long to get our food so no reasons to not hand out the 5 stars! Must visit during your stay in Berlin!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2016-10-10,"As a relatively large Italian restaurant at a popular area, I'm disappointed with the Italian food it serves.  

A salad with scampi uses ready made dressing or one that tastes like those you pour out of a plastic bottle. For 12.50? in Berlin, I would have expected a decent sized pawn but no. The size is about U15-U20 for those readers from the States. 

Then, let's talk about the penne arrabiata. A simple dish. I switched penne with spaghetti. The spaghetti tastes like packaged pasta rather than homemade. The sauce is just blah. The kitchen likely used pre-made margarita for the pizza or diluted tomato paste. There should be some garlic but I see none. There is also no heat coming off the pepper they used. Even I couldn't make it that poorly at home. Noted is that the pasta costs 8.50?. 

Food is so so, did the service made it up? Not in my opinion. Pre-order, he did not ask if I have any question, nor volunteered information about house specials. When I asked for flat water, he brought a small bottle that's just not suitable for a dinner. 

So, to sum it up, I gave it a two-star.  Maybe just an occasional bad experience given it has a four-star average rating."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-12-25,"Very good service,really nice customer service and good food ! luardi rissotto excellent ! Recommend"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-08-19,Great Italian food and service in West Berlin. We had the penne arrabbiata and the pizza. Both were excellent. The wine list was adequate and the service was very good. Highly recommend.
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-04-17,"Wonderful food in the busiest area in Berlin. A hidden gem to most. Went there with friends and ordered 2 risottos and a pasta. Very delicious and prompt service. The only thing was they made me wait for 10 mins at the beginning in the entrance, even with reservation and the restaurant was not full (at 1830). Will give it another chance in a few weeks."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-11-28,Great restaurant. Food quality and taste is excellent. The service is very good. I was amazed how fast they brought the food yet it was very tasty. We ordered the pasta with pesto and pizza margarita. This is definitely the place to eat in berlin
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-03-29,"Pesto, pine nut, olive oil pasta with tomato basil mozzarella started was great!  Even had Peroni beer. I recommend even if I personally don't like customer herders in the front of the place. If your in the area worth a stop for a nice Italian restaurant."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2014-04-27,"A perfectly adequate Italian restaurant on Meinekestrasse in Berlin. 
The waitstaff are attentive and we even got a table for six on a busy Saturday night (thank you, other guests, for moving to another table)! The food is fine, although not absolutely top rate italian, but then again, we're not in Italy. The wines by the glass are average as well. 
If you go here for the festive and lively atmosphere, not for great dining, you'll have a wonderful time."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-03-11,"Ok, this place is seriously good. The waitstaff is amazing (they sing!!) and if you are friendly you may get a few freebies throughout dinner :) Highly recommended if you get sick of German fare on your travels!"
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-11-21,"My colleague and I came across this restaurant during a walk around the neighbourhood near our hotel.  The woman out front was helpful and friendly, and the restaurant was doing solid business, so we took a chance and went inside.  It was the day I arrived in Berlin after an overnight flight and I really didn't have much of an appetite.  I only had some of a shared melon and prosciutto appetizer followed by a bowl of seafood soup.  The service was friendly, and the food held promise, so we made a note of the place so we could find it again.

We ended up here again a few nights later with a larger group.  With my regular appetite returned, I was up for a pomodoro salad, gnocchi, with tiramisu for dessert. (I know, quite a difference!)  All were very good.  The gnocchi was different from what I'm used to: these were like small stuffed pillows and the gnocchi I'm used to are smaller without filling.  My colleagues also enjoyed their meals, but there was a mix up on one of the orders.  I think that this was a language problem: the wait staff are Italian, and although they have decent enough English, some things don't translate easily or are misheard.  Well, what the waiter lacked in language skills he more than made up by being entertaining, trading jokes and poking fun.  At the end of our dinner, our waiter offered us all a complimentary aperitif: Sambuca, limoncello, etc. -- a very nice surprise and a great way to end the evening."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2012-09-14,"We passed by this restaurant every day when we were leaving our hotel. One day, we stopped in. I wanted pizza. The minestrone soup had a lot of vegetables. This was good since we went all out with the spinach and gorgonzola pizza to share. Inside is pretty fancy. Make sure not to wear a fanny-pack inside. (Why you would even wear this awful accessory when visiting Germany is beyond me!) Outside seating is perfect on a nice day, but the seats go quickly and you might get caught inside. The servers speak German, Italian, and English. Mix it up with a trilingual combo to make your visit to this Italian eatery top notch."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-12-13,"Amazing atmosphere, excellent staff and great food to remember. Add to that a great value for money and you got a perfect restaurants."
Luardi,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2013-05-03,"I absolutely love not just the food and the ambience, but the entire staff that works there.  Each and every time I've been, they great me like family.  Can't imagine staying  anywhere near Luardi's and not going in.  It's a fave!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-06-04,"My boyfriend and I found this restaurant through a travel blogger on Pinterest. We were looking for reasonably priced food that was still authentic and delicious (obviously the most important). We jumped on the train from our hotel to Papa Pane di Sorrento.
When we got there we grabbed a spot outside on their patio. It is in a nicer area and neighborhood of Berlin, so we were able to watch the people are cars go by on a quiet Tuesday night. 
They had an English menu which was fantastic, but our waitress didn't speak any English. Turns out ""pizza, beer, and wine"" is a universal language for everyone though! 
We both got our own pizzas which was a little too much food for us, you could probably split one for two people. Also, remember that in Germany they cut everything while they eat it, so don't be a stupid American and eat your slices with your hands!
I would give this restaurant 6/5 stars if I could. It was such an excellent stop during our trip, I highly recommend!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-05-06,"This place is very busy, regardless of the day, but especially so on weekends. Regardless, it is definitely worth the wait. The interior is small, a bit loud and a bit cramped. There seem to be too many tables crammed into the inside and there's no waiting area for customers. 

That's the bad, everything else is fantastic. Service was good and our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. 

What you came for, the food, is very good. My party all had pizza, which was the best Italian-style pizza I have had in a long while. I saw one review said the bottom side of the crust was not crispy enough. While I would agree, it didn't detract from the quality or taste of the pizza, in my opinion. 

I had the salami pizza and the people with me had the spinach and ricotta. Both were well made and delicious. 

Definitely worth a visit! I wish I had more time in Berlin so I could return and try something else."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2017-09-17,"Papa pane was introduced to me as one of the best pizza place in Berlin but it is more than a pizzeria. They also serve respectable pastas. It is a bit weak on the antipasto/appetizer though. Wines are well priced so a good option. The place can be very busy so reservation really helps otherwise you may have to wait for quite a while before 8:30/9:00 pm. Overall, pizza is a better bet over pasta."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-02-28,"I decided to come here for my birthday so I booked a table in advance because we were quite a big group. The restaurant is located just a few minutes away from Rosenthaler Platz.
This place is super italian. Only italian waiters, white and red checked table cloths and it's pretty loud and crowded inside. 
We all went for pizzas and they're all very good and affordable as well. House wine was good as well!
Service was really friendly, food was good and the ambiance was also enjoyable. Can definitely recommend this restaurant if you're on the hunt for a nice Italian place. Be aware that it's a little bit more on the pricy side for Berlin standards."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-03-12,"One of my favorite pizza places in Berlin. Pizza, pasta, fish dishes, amazing deserts - everything is supper yummy. Great selection of Italian wines. 

Great for groups and families with kids. They have kids size pizzas! Place is always full, so call in advance to reserve a table. Service can be a little bit slow, but with all the people to serve it's understandable. 

House wine (red or white) is what I usually drink with my vegan Marinara pizza."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,1,2017-09-20,I would give this zero stars if I could. We tried to come here for an early evening dinner. We were seated but our hostess was VERY rude and seemed annoyed that we had even walked through the door. We sat at our table while two servers argued back and forth about setting up different reservation tables and completely ignored us for about 10 minutes. After the attitudes and the rudeness that was shown we felt unwelcome and decided to leave. I guess if you're American DO NOT go here!
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,2,2017-09-04,"Good pizza, bad service! Overwhelmingly loud! They have mixed our orders several times!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-10-16,"Amazing amazing amazing experience! We walked past and got a table after a very nice couple moved so we could sit 5. The atmosphere was autentic and immediatly we knew this was gonna be good. Classic but yet not ""boring"" menu. Then the food arrived. Oh. My. God. The pasta with asparagus and truffle is a must try, but everything else we got was amazing as well. 
The waiters was fun and managed the crowded restaurant effectively. 
This restaurant is worth a trip!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2017-03-11,Good house wines and younger (20'and 30's) crowd. Crowded and noisy. Pizza was not crispy enough. The servers had too many tables - asked for a napkin and never arrived - forgot our drink order. Almost authentic food but simple things like fresh pepper would make it nicer. Good value on prices. Made a reservation but was useless. - they put 5 of us on a small table for four.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-04-29,"Great spot! Highly recommend a reservation, as it gets quite busy and there isn't much room where you can wait. The pizza and appetizers were fantastic, as was the service. And even though it was full, we never felt rushed. Go here! You won't be disappointed :)"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-02-29,"Such amazing, authentic Neapolitan pizza at an amazing price! The pizzas are huge - falling off the big plates - and they are mostly under ?10! Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The menu is first in Italian and then German. Not much English spoken, which contributed to accidentally buying a ?5 bottle of water. We went here because celebrities like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are here, and now I see why! If you want the best pizza in Berlin, look no further!"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-04-21,"Was taken there for a business/informal lunch. I was ordered a custom pasta with truffle and ham. It was super delicious. The restaurant is in a very nice building, the interior is a mix of elegant and simple italian style."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,1,2016-08-11,"We went with kids to Papa Pane , we have to wait 40 minutes for our pizzas on a lunch time , waiter was overbooked, and she does not seem at all to be embarrassed for us. Quality was average, so no worth waiting that much. TOO MUCH olive oil on the pizzas :("
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-02-14,"One of the authentic italian pizza place in center of Berlin. Reservation is must as this place is always full.

During our first visit , tried Pizza Papa Pane ( vegetarian ) and Panna Cotta ( Dessert ) , both were very delicious.

Pizza size is really big , do order first ( good for 2 people ) and later go for second based on hunger left :)

Highly recommended"
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-03-31,Went here when I was in Berlin and had a wonderful meal! Delicious carbonara and salami pizza. Also very well priced and nice staff!
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-10-11,"My boyfriend and I decided this is our favorite Italian place in the neighborhood. The pizza is yummy and the pasta dishes are too. Wine good, salads too. Fair price. Service comparable to the rest of Berlin. Pasta with asparagus and truffle oil amazing!   It's lively inside and pleasant to sit outside when weather permits."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2015-08-25,The place smelled inside like an ashtray. Smokers right outside allowing smoke to drift inside. The pizza was okay. The crust was too thick and the rest was too soft and wouldn't hold up. The lasagna was good. Service was okay as well. We went for lunch I would say 1/3 full.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,2,2015-02-05,"Once upon a time it was a place with good pizza for reasonable prices with a nice italian flair....those times are over...pizza is still good...prices raised and service...well ehm...there is no service anymore...but a motto...eat fast, leave tip and go...dishes coming not the same time...they starting taking the plates away before EVERYone is finished...so if your touristguide tells you to go there...go ahead...it is a touristplace with touristtreating right now...not such a nice place for pizza in berlin like it was..."
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,4,2013-12-19,Great italien place with a lunch menu that almost seems like a steal. Especially the homemade pasta is great.
Pap? Pane di Sorrento,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-08-05,"Delicious bruschetta, I loved the juicy tomatoes on the homemade bread. The Pizza with spinach was just as Pizza should be. So happy to eventually have found a great Pizzeria in Berlin. Staff was friendly, and the location is central. I sat outside on one of these warm summer nights."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-09-13,"An excellent and deservedly popular Italian located on the delightful Viktoria Luise Platz.

The restaurant has a small outside eating area at the front, but a much larger dining room inside which stretches a long way back. The decor has a motorcycling theme, with half a dozen bikes on display, and lots of posters, photographs and trophies. (I gather this reflects the chef's passion.)

The food is traditionally Italian; there's a limited selection of pasta, a choice of around a dozen pizzas, but most people were enjoying traditional meat and fish dishes as mains.

Our group of four had an excellent meal: starters of calamari, mixed salad, and mozzarella and tomato salad were followed by linguine with clams, porcini and saffron risotto and tagliatelle with meatballs. Portions were generous and the quality was outstanding. (Best risotto in years.) Two courses with beer and water can to ?160 for four, including service.

Service was friendly and they speak reasonable English, alongside German and Italian.

Definitely worth a visit but it is best to book as they're packed, even on Mondays."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-06-18,"Definitely a foody place! Reservation is needed. Small place with big appetite...offer traditional Italian dishes. If you have been experienced Italian food, traditional ways, then it a good place to start...if you had have, then it's a good place to, temporarily, curl your appetite until you visit Italy again. It's authentic in every ways, outdoor, entry way, inside, bar, tables setting...big pot of parmesan cheese (have a peek behind the bar)...bring your appetite...Buon appetito !"
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-08-19,"My companion and I were here last night for a spontaneous dinner date. We called around 18:30 asking if they still had a free table that evening, and when they said yes, we booked a table for 19:00. 

Twenty minutes walking later, we arrived, and a table was waiting for us. They have a menu, where all the classic dishes are listed, but I highly suggest to come here with a good memory, as the non-classical seasonal menus are not written anywhere. Rather, one of the staff will orally narrate you what they have for appetizers, as well as main dishes. From how it sounds, it seems that the seasonal dishes are way more interesting than the classical dishes. Same thing goes for the dessert: they don't list them in the menu, but they just narrate it to you. Believe me, the list is long, hence it is indeed a narration.

You can ask them to repeat it, if you have a small memory.

I took the duck carpaccio as an appetizer, which was served with chantarelles and fennel in a sweet balsamic sauce. That was quite tasty. I followed that with the tuna steak and caponata, and the salty flavor of the tuna matched well with the sweet caponata, which was quite fantastic. My partner ordered the tuna carpaccio, followed by lamb cutlets as a main dish.

The wine recommendation was also great: they recommended a white wine from Liguria, which was refreshing and matched well with what we ordered. The bottle wasn't crazy expensive either, just 24 euros for a very delicious alcoholic experience.

I am so glad I found this place; having seen it once while jogging in the morning, I always had this place bookmarked, and I am glad we went. I would definitely make an effort to come back again sometime."

Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-10-01,I've eaten at many Italian restaurants across the world and this is one of the best.  We walked in off the street with no reservation on a rainy Saturday night and the owner made us feel like family.  The food was amazing and very reasonably priced.  If you are looking for authentic Italian this is the place to go!
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2015-05-27,"This place is severely overrated. First of all, it's an at least $$$. Second, the service is far from exceptional. This may be due to my outside seating though, which resulted from all tables inside being reserved! Thankfully it wasn't that cold. And the food was just fine, nothing to make a fuss of. Thus I rate my experience as average."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-05-09,"Simply the best Italian food I ever had... The meal commenced with Chianti and olives... Next, we enjoyed the steak carpaccio (which was momentarily baked with black truffles and parmesan cheese.)  We also also had the roasted white asparagus au gratin. (Spargel).  This was paired with a small salad and Schinken.  As an entr?e, we had two variations of the pork platter; one with wine sauce, the other was lemon sauce.  This was accompanied by roasted rosemary potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.

Our waiter deserves an A+ for service, hospitality, and humor.  He was passionate about the food, and perfectly accommodating.  The interior and exterior are charming.  A Moto Guzzi theme... Absolutely perfect!!   We will be back."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-08-10,"We were lucky to get a walk in table, but I would say that reservation is an absolute must. It is a small place with some outside seating in the summer. The food is delicious, easily in the top italian restaurants in Berlin. The grilled squid with lentils is perfectly seasoned and has amazing texture and taste. The iberico pork was tender and the sauce was just perfect. The sushi grade tuna tartare was perfect and it all finished with a pistachio dessert that was half frozen.  Prices are maybe a bit higher compared to your regular Italian restaurant, but it is certainly worth the extra spend. Overall an amazing meal, we certainly will go back there."
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-06-25,"Authentic, home-style Italian food, in a comfortable atmosphere, at a good price. Located on Viktoria Luisa Platz, they have lovely outdoor seating as well, facing the park. The staff, Davide and Francesca, took great care of us. Some delicious specials - try the liver saut?ed in butter with sage, or the zigeuner di manzo !! A++"
Osteria Ribaltone,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2015-06-18,"The food is very good, but the service is substandard, especIally if you're not Italian. I won't be coming back."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-02-25,"Wow real great pizza, reminds me of the ones i had in Napoli.. actually all the courses were delicious, at out table we tried melanzane alla parmigiana and lasagna too.. just incredible. 

Only downside for me is the location, 8 minutes walk from the first train station (bus stop is close though)"
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,4,2018-01-04,"Really tasty italian food! The appetizers were great- recommend the beef carpaccio and eggplant parmigiana. Pizza was better than most, though not the best in Berlin. Standard selection and lots of creative pies. Solid crust. Altogether good meal."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,3,2017-07-19,"The pizzas were delicious but the service was a little off. We got there at 5:30, when they open. They were there but not ready for us. Fair enough. But they didn't come to the door to even let us in, or acknowledge we were there. A cool reception. The tables on the street are noisy and unpleasant. I recommend sitting inside or in the garden (which they didn't offer us). All in all, the service experience feels like the amateurish Berlin of 10 years ago, not the standards of the international dining city that it's become today."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-03-09,"My wife and I lived in Italy for several years, and visited Naples a few times, so we feel qualified to say that the pizzas are Prometeo are on par with a quality pizzeria in Naples. They even have an imported wood burning pizza oven from Naples, which is prominently visible when you walk in. The prices are also very reasonable, and the service was friendly and efficient. We also enjoyed the suppli' (rice balls) and tiramis?. We are regular customers and we highly suggest a visit, you will not be disappointed."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-03-29,"HANDS DOWN. I've tasted a lot of pizzas in Berlin, but this one is the absolute best. It tastes like it was made in Italy. You actually taste the authenticity of this pizza. Incredible."
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-10-30,"Only had take out (thus far) so I can't comment on the service, but the pizza is pretty well-executed napoletano style pizza with tasty dough and fair prices. Will be trying out the storefront soon!"
Prometeo,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-06-06,"Simple yet with great incredients, thin, perfect crust, savory - the last time I had such a good Pizza was literally two decades ago in Bologna."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2017-12-28,"It's our favorite Italian restaurant in Berlin.
In our last visit it was not the best one but had amazing nights there 
They have a good wine list and specially if u go for dinner everything tends to be better!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,3,2017-12-29,"A fair Italian restaurant with fresh ingredients, well seasoned food located in the shopping area. A worth-to-try for causal lunch or a date. 
Just need to cook my linguine long enough so it won't taste like a stick inside. Cheers."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,1,2016-07-28,"Until today's lunch, I've held this restaurant in high regard. I had a cheese and fig salad as an appetizer and fish as the main. 3 hours later, I felt ill. After an hour of trying to suppress it, my lunch came up with such a force!

Still shaking I called the restaurant to warn them (I speak German fluently). They asked my name. I told them then suggested that they check that the fish is fully cooked. Surprisingly, he hung up in my face!

If you go there, keep it on the meat side."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,1,2015-09-07,"The end of the meal KILLED the entire experience here

After they took our dessert orders, they immediately served coffee and cappuccino, but 30 minutes NO dessert still. I asked the waitress where is the dessert and she said it will be right out. I said cancel it and 15 minutes later they came with dessert with another person and i said we cancelled this because after coffee it took too long and they were RUDE!

I said to the waitress that it was the fault of the kitchen and not hers in a sweet tone and she was still defensive and rude

To top it off, the table next to us after a few minutes of ordering their dessert was served theirs. I wonder if it was our dessert?!?!?!!!!!

Everything before that was great. Great food, great wine recommendations - BUT they did not handle this well at all!!!!

Caveat Emptor!!!!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,1,2016-08-07,"Don't get fooled by the beauty of the building ... this place is a scam.
Super pricey for low quality food.
Seriously... we got some dodgy fried spring onions on top of our meal, felt like shredded plastic bags: impossible to eat.
Mozzarella is tiny and tasteless.
Presentation is cheap.
Decoration is kinda tasteless.

You will pay around 100 euros for 2, for a bad Italian meal in a pompous restaurant.
You could pay half in some simple trattoria for an amazing meal in a nice atmosphere."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2013-10-13,"Very good Italian restaurant in the heart of Berlin. Decent selection of wines, tasty food and very lively atmosphere, which makes me come back here every time I stay around.

Interior is very pleasant, bright colors and my favorite bulbs hanging over the table.

Both fish and meet I ate here tastes very delicious. Be sure to save some time and space for dessert.

Highly recommended for people wanting to experience Italian pace in Berlin :)"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,1,2015-10-26,"We went here today on our day trip to Berlin as we were told it was one of the better Italian spots in Berlin - boy was that an overstatement!

After an hour we had still not received our main course (pasta - takes 3 minutes to cook). The manager said he lost our order and would get it right out. 15 minutes later, NOTHING! 

Upon attempting to talk to our waitress she blew us off multiple times. Still never received our food! Started to walk out and waitress has the audacity to tell us we hadn't paid our check!!! We were there over an hour and a half and never even got our meal .....

After leaving we were told they don't like Americans and that's why it happened. Worst service and experience we've had in Germany so far, completely ruined our day trip to Berlin!!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,3,2015-04-14,"3.5/5 for me here

We came in as party of 8 looking for some relief from the heavier German cuisine from the week.  We were recommended this restaurant and fortunately they had room for us, I would suggest making reservations with larger parties.  It is situated on one of the main shopping streets in Berlin so it is easy enough to locate and get to via metro.

The ambiance is more upscale dining with an authentic trattoria like twist.  There is a large table in the back that is adjacent to the wine cellar which is nice to see.  The wait staff serving us were all Italians which shows the authenticity of the restaurant sticking to its roots which was nice to see.  They were all friendly and accommodating throughout our dining experience.

Getting to the food, we started with an assortment of burrata that was very fresh and excellent, carpaccio of branzino that was very light and good as well, and the octopus that was cooked nice and tender.  For entrees, we tried spaghettini alle vongole that were fresh, gnochettini verde that was colorful and well balanced with tomatoes and ricotta, spaghetti with truffle, and several order of fish fillets.  Everything was prepared with fresh ingredients and offered some nice flavors.  I would recommend the burrata, octopus, and gnochettini if you needed to narrow down your choices.

To finish off the meal we also tried several in home-made desserts that were ok.  Nothing really stood out to the group here but always a nice way to end the meal with some sweets and espressos.  After a couple of bottles of wine and taxes/tip, the meal came out to about 45/euro a person which was very reasonable for what we ordered.

Buon appetito"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,5,2015-06-22,"Whoda thunk there would be such top-notch Italian cuisine in the land of Schnitzel and sauerkraut ?   This place gets it right, particularly with a world class pasta....tagliolini with butter and shaved black truffle.   Definite must as a main course, and do the rigatoni with house made sausage as a starter.  The rest really doesn't matter, since these two will have you ooing and ahhing.  If still hungry, tiramisu is a great finish.  As for wine, they have $100 Brunello (Donna) that goes well with all of it."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,5,2016-02-04,This place has tourist trap written all over it so it was quite a surprise when it turned out to be a wonderful and super tasty meal.
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2014-08-24,"Elegant Italian restaurant on Friedrichstrasse.  Attentive service.  The waiters were fairly aggressive in pouring bottled water at E 4 per bottle.  The wine that we wanted was sold out and the waiter showed us alternatives in the same price range.  The fish soup was excellent.  My wife had the special of pasta with shaved truffles.   She found the buttery sauce that it was served in to be too rich, but other patrons were scarfing it down with reckless abandon.  I had a special of quail wrapped in pancetta and stuffed with a mixture of ricotta and pistachios that was very good.  

If you want an upscale restaurant in Berlin and are tired of German food, this is a good place."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,3,2015-06-14,"It was ok. Burata starter could have been a little creamier and my rigatoni entree seemed over-salted to the point that I didn't finish it. Wasn't worth the high price tag for our party, no one was impressed."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,5,2015-07-13,"Excellent food, best veal steak and very very good lamb steak. For Germany or anywhere else it is first class. The service is a bit slow but a well prepared dish is your reward. If you are in the Friederichstrasse area, it should be at the top of anyone's list."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2012-09-30,"I like this place, despite being the film scene every year.... I adore the steaks."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2014-08-22,Very good food and friendly service. The menu is simple not a lot of choices but it's very good very clean environment with a modern look.
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2013-06-18,"Very nice. Lovely ambiance, excellent service, good food. 

Both elements of the quail with asparagus appetizer were nicely prepared but they didn't quite come together as one dish. The asparagus gratin starter was more successful. Duck with raspberry sauce and rack of lamb entrees were very good, but the black tagliatelle with pesto lacked the expected depth of flavor. 

In spite of the shortcomings of some individual items, this restaurant is recommended."
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,4,2014-10-23,Great meal for group of 8 from 13 to 80 years old. Friendly Efficient service. Food and wine very good

Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,5,2013-09-12,"Just excellent. Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in Berlin. The food is gorgious (try the sword fish for the main dish, absolutely fabulous, not to mention the tira-mi-su). Extensive wine list, very fair prices. Friendly service, reservation required, the place is packed practically all the time. Highly recommended!"
Bocca di Bacco,Italian,4.0,?21-40,3,2009-09-02,"Bocca di Bacco is a really nice trendy Italian restaurant serving nice meals but in a high price category. The prices you pay here you would expect to pay for a fabulous a la carte restaurant else where. The price tag does effect if you are in a tourist area or not and this restaurant is., it is situated in Berlin Mitte close to many tourist hotels.


 The food was ok, nothing really breathtaking that's if you are use to good food, but it does look and taste good but it is more of a trendy Italian style of cooking rather than basic Italian cooking.


 I would advise to reserve a table; we didn't when we arrived there so we had to wait for around 30 minutes in there seating area and had drinks while we waited. The staff are really pleasant and professional, they know their jobs and they know how to perform. We had a good waiter and even though he was rushed off his feet, he was never to busy to ask the guests if they are enjoying the meal, really attentive.


 A good wine is really pricey here, we paid 85 Euros for a standard red wine full of body, but it was really good, therefore worth what we paid for it.


 This is a place where you would have business meetings, spend the evening with family or friends, not really a romantic thing as it is quite busy and very large therefore not very suttle as guests and staff are rushing by. It a place if you want a quick meal close to your hotel"
Osteria Ferrari,Italian,5.0,?11-20,5,2017-10-26,"I went here the other day with my boyfriend who has been looking for non ""German-Italian"" food, specifically from Emilia-Romagna, and he was extremely happy with the entire experience from the food, atmosphere and the service.  Although the place is a bit pricey for Berlin, the work that is required to prepare the dishes exceeds the price that they charge per dish. 

The only downside from the date is that now he misses home!"
Osteria Ferrari,Italian,5.0,?11-20,5,2016-11-22,"One of Berlin top Italian restaurants. Authentic regional cuisine from Emilia. The pasta is just  out of this world, you will rarely eat this good in Berlin, I haven't tried a single dish in this place that wasn't amazing. I can easily recommend anything on the menu, the homemade Tortelloni, Soli, Cappellacci are all delicious. Not to mention this place has one of the best and more attentive table service in the entire city, which is incredibly refreshing for Berlin. Do yourself a favor and come to visit this place, you will get addicted."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2017-01-31,"Been coming here frequently ever since they opened. Homemade fresh organic pasta. Daily changing seasonal sauce options. Reasonably priced and always fresh. Very good coffee and freshly squeezed juices.

A friend of mine went here for our lunch hour from work and we were very satisfied customers!! The pasta was absolutely delicious and home made! Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Berlin - 5 Stars without a doubt!"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-09-06,"What a great little place! I visited on a grey and rainy day and it really warmed me up. It is a small, cozy space with an assortment of tables and couches inside. The woman who helped me was very kind and the prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the fresh food!

For other tourists like me: the front display has the freshly made pastas and there is a chalkboard with the types of sauces you can order, as well as some sandwiches. Fridges have an assortment of drinks and they are self serve. You order at the register and they bring everything out to you. After your meal you pay for everything (foods and drinks). 

I had a rosemary pasta with bolognese sauce and a Milchkaffe. Very enjoyable meal :)"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,2017-04-21,"Small place in the heart of f'hain. The place itself is not all too romantic, but definitely comfortable and the staff is very friendly! We had one pasta with zucchini and feta which was not amazing (a bit simple) but good anyways, and one aglio olio pasta that was absolutely delicious! Also, the antipasta was tasty. We would definitely go back for a bite again."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,3,2016-08-03,"I got take away. I ordered gnocchi with tomatoes and black olives. I thought they might have pesto, but they did not at the time I went. So I ended up buying my own jar and adding it because their flavor was bland. The pasta itself was cooked well. Staff was nice and food came out in a timely manner. Personally, do not think it was worth the price though. Easier to make my own."

Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-09-01,"A great find.  Delicious food (not Naples, but as good as you will find in Germany), friendly service, and a good vibe.  For visitors, this is walking distance to the Stasi Museum."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,3,2011-07-04,"I really like this place, food is great, coffee is good and the people are chill.


 I'd say stopping by for an espresso is a must, but pasta only if you're not in a hurry and don't mind waiting for 40+ minutes."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2010-07-03,"Very nice bio / organic pasta for good prices.


 Also delicious sandwiches (I had one of the best caprese sandwiches ever here - I can still taste it!) and very good coffee!


 Great for lunch!"
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,2009-12-30,"Great pasta to a low price, but the 40 minute wait when I was there takes away a star. Also, no toilets.


 Update October 2010: This has become one of my regular lunch joints in the last months. The pasta is indeed very good, and we have never needed to wait that long again - food comes within 10 or 15 minutes (but we always go there when it's not crowded). Sometimes I use the wlan."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2012-03-03,"One of my favorite places for a lunch in Berlin- Fiedrichshain. Very good value for a delicious organic food. (5-8 eur for a dish). Tiny store with a friendly staff, nice ambient and a lots of regulars that keep coming back again and again.. The portions are not to big but full of great taste and after all filling up the stomach. I have never waited more than 15 minuts for a dish. Highly recommended."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,4,2008-09-25,"A quite small but extremely cosy cafe in Friedrichshain, the runner is the home made (but inexpensive!) pasta of different kinds with herbs and vegetables with 4-5 different sauces. But what you should taste anyway is the vegetable salad - it is a small poem! I don't know how they work this miracle
It's a pity they don't have guests' toilets."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2009-08-05,"This is a must-go for anyone looking for: 1. great pasta dishes 2. coffee / delicious espresso /etc 3. great ambiance 3. soy milk substitute for lactose products


 I am impressed by pastapresti with a very clean exterior and interior. At first you think it's just a nice and clean coffee house. The impressive parts comes when you look at the chalk-board menu and see the combination of sauces / vegetable organic/home-made pasta combination that can be ordered.


 Go for it, sit and relax, enjoy the beautifully simple ambiance and sip on your soy-latte and aubergine/twisty pasta combo.


 You should go. It's cheap and amazingly delicious."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2008-07-30,"i was introduced to this little place by an italian friend who works around the corner. quality homemade organic pasta at great prices with a friendly staff. i also had an amazing vegan carrot cake there once. the only downside is that they aren't open very late (20:00), so you'd better make it an early dinner. otherwise, it makes for a great lunch spot."
Pastapresti,Italian,4.5,Under ?10,5,2008-11-20,small and cozy bio shop with freshly made pastas & amazing coffee. they also have wines for sale. really nice place to enjoy a pasta and espresso

Matteo Tosatti is uber friendly owner of the place who makes all kind of pasta by himself in front of the guests.
I can only advice going there, because this place satisfies you in everything : nice atmosphere, fancy design, good people working there and very-very good food.

grazie mille!"

Masteca e Tasi,Italian,5.0,?11-20,5,2015-01-31,"My favorite restaurant for a business lunch! Menu changes every week and dishes are always fresh and seasonal, with some regional italian gems not easy to find elsewhere. Real italian cuisine (and chef!). Staff is super friendly. For lunch I strongly recommend to book in advance or be there early, since the place is quite small and it?s always full after 1pm."
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-07-09,"This place was great. I lived in Italy for 6 months and the food here was on par with authentic Italian cuisine. The staff/owner were also very friendly, you can tell they really want you to have a wonderful meal. Highly recommended!"
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-11-22,Went on a Monday night - not crowded. Great local find. Ordered a mozzarella and tomato antipasti. Got spaghetti carbonara and spaghetti bolognese for dinner - both were outstanding. Large portions for very reasonable prices.
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-07-16,"My boyfriend and I had a craving for Italian while visiting Berlin, and found Peperonico through Yelp. It was a darling spot right on the corner by a park. With such a nice view, we chose to sit outside so we could people watch and enjoy the scenery.

We kicked things off with a caprese salad and some wine. For entrees, I had a mushroom pasta and my date had a pretty simply red sauce pasta dish. Mine was delicious, while his was a little basic. Thankfully, the portions were colossal so he could share some of mine since it was better.

Our server was a sweetheart and made it that much better of a dinner."
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-06-20,"We came here for my son's birthday.  He wanted Italian.  It was not a busy night, so we had two servers waiting on our table of seven people.  We had the mushroom with garlic appetizer, and the artichokes in a cream sauce.  Both were delicious.  The mushrooms had lots of garlic which was a delicious change from other food we've had in Berlin.  The artichokes were good, and my kids devoured a basket of bread finishing up the sauce.

Dinner was also good.  My ravioli with almonds and an alfredo sauce was delicate and delicious without being too heavy.  Note that the tuna salad, while delicious, is enormous.  It is not a one-person serving.  Share it with a friend.

If we lived here, this would be our go-to Italian restaurant.  The kitchen head was by our table several times to assess our happiness, which is a touch I appreciated."
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2014-08-18,"I really enjoyed this place, even if I did need to be rolled home after our 6-course meal! We did the surprise menu, which was fun because you name your price and then they give you as many courses as they see fit for that. We decided to be fancy and went with ?25 each, which got us 6 delicious courses. I think if I went back, I would go with a big bowl of their homemade pasta instead. However, I thoroughly enjoyed our huge meal and liters of wine. The service was great, albeit a bit slow, but that was fine with me since he was back there whipping every course up as he went. The chef even came out and checked on all of us, which shows how much they care about the quality of food. 

This is a great place for a date and I definitely recommend it!"
Peperoncino,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2013-12-08,"We went for a Sunday dinner with a close friend. We had read some reviews beforehand and can clearly say we weren't disappointed. The food was great and while simple with eye for detail. 
The service was friendly and the owner and chef made us feel at home in no time. Ambience is that of a typical Italian trattoria and certainly not fancy. But once again: simplicity is what drives the comfortable feel of the place. 
The prices were very low. Needless to say we were happy to give a nice tip."
Poveracci,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-11-23,If you're prepared to settle in and have a few glasses of wine if the service is slow you'll have an incredibly flavor filled meal. The black taglioni and scampi was perfect as was the ravioli.  The house red and white wines are just fine.  Who knew I had to come to Berlin to get an excellent Italian meal?!
Poveracci,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-05-15,"Super cozy, very friendly, yummy food

A small place, tightly packed with a dozen tables, candle light and reflection of light from the wine bottles on all the walls and the bustle of the open kitchen at the end of the room... This was our initial impression. 

After being seated, the waiter stepped over, sat down next to us and took the order. Or rather, we spoke about what we wanted to eat. No note taking and no rush; personal with eye contact. 

We had mixed antipasti plate, a couple of pizzas and a stuffed tortellini from the daily specials menu. All the dishes were delicious, nicely presented, and fairly priced. The ""house wine"" was really yummy too. 

Will definitely come back"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-09-06,"Great and huge pizzas and other italian food.
Very cheap and kind service.
Nice place to sit in. :)"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-08-20,"I was really hungry and not in the mood for Pasta or Pizza, so I actually ordered a Pollo a la Gorgonzola.
The dish was well prepared and tasted good and the potatoes side was perfect.
The restaurant also avoids the pitfall of many other Italian restaurants and actually has a concise, compact menu, and when the menu is small then this usually things are made well.

The real special thing about the place is the prices. All dishes are very fairly priced and you can have a full dinner with a drink and desert for less than 15 EUR. Service is also very friendly."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-12-31,"We were here on new years eve - I was surprised, you hardly expect this on an evening like that - the food was excellent, we tested various dishes like tagliatelle tartufo, antipasti misti, swordfish carpaccio, Pizza Parma etc. - it was really good, will definitely be visiting this place again :-)
Felice anno nuovo!"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-04-27,"Great cozy Italian place. Service was wonderful and the food was terrific. We were there for dinner and ordered off of their pasta menu. The penne pollo was delicious. Tip - If you fancy pizza, let them know - they'll make it and bring it from their pizza place next door."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-07-27,"This is one of my favorite pizza places in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, just like it has to be, crispy thin Italian style and fresh toppings - very tasty and staff is really friendly here as well"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-10-23,"Great food, fast and very tasty. Simple, but the best. Under 15 euro's per person. Great value for money. Great atmosphere. Would recommend it!"
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-09-20,"I loved the atmosphere and our waitress. It was so refreshing and welcoming, perfect for a small group of friends and even a date.
The food was good and plenty for the price. 5 of us are generously for only 100 euros. I don't like the giant Parmesan grate they use, it dries out the food. Get the antipasti platter - it's huge and really good. The main courses were all pretty good (not amazing). If they have the truffle ravioli, get it. It was the best dish they served us that night."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-12-10,"Good food, nice ambiance and friendly service. I've tried the pizza and the pasta. It's not the best Italian food I've ever had, but it's very good."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2012-08-23,"Good food, reasonable prices. Nice staff. I'll definitely visit them again. Nice starters, very good gnocchi, house wine was an easily drinkable red, desert didn't blow me away."
Cotto e Crudo,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2012-02-19,always end up returning here for any special occasion. prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and the staff are lovely. couldn't fault it
Bertolini,Italian,5.0,?11-20,5,2017-01-26,"Best restaurant in that area. Great Food, nice Staff, very cosy! A recommendation for lunch and Dinner! Love this place! Reservations shall be made."
Bertolini,Italian,5.0,?11-20,4,2014-08-18,"A very good italian deli style restaurant. They have a huge selection of antipasti that you can either have in house or also take away. We went for the the antipasti plate and it really was delicious. I loved their vegetables and the fish selection was very good as well. If you are more into full dishes, they also have a small menu available. Overall a great little find. Will certainly go back there."
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-10-17,Excellent restaurant. The pasta is delicious and the Burratta can't be missed. Wine is great and reasonably priced. Live near by and we go as often as we can!
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-07-21,"If you go here, you have to eat the fucking burrata. It's juicy, fresh and yeah, just amazing.

As main course I had the ravioli with ricotta. That was good aswell but as I already had suspected, it didn't match up with the previous course.

It's a tiny restaurang, and it feels like a great place to hang out on now and then if you live nearby. The prices are pretty moderate, as a bonus. But the service needs to cheer up a bit, tbh."
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4.0,?11-20,3,2013-06-18,"Quite a cozy place, perfect for a warm night. Good wine and pasta. A bit pricey though, with the pasta dishes going towards ?10. Still, worth a visit!"
Sala Da Mangiare,Italian,4.0,?11-20,5,2012-10-01,"I love Italian and for a while there were just a couple of places I enjoyed in Berlin. Not being a friend of some of the places that try to sell you popular cuisine by posting revolutionary posters and hiring only tatooed waiters (anybody living in Berlin know what I am talkiing about) but pumping up prices to tourist trap levels, the Sala da Mangiare was an amazing discovery. I have only been there once but it motivated me to write and I'll go back pretty soon. The pasta is freshly baked (ask the cook to explain you how he does it), service is as friendly and humble as it gets, prices are what you expect for the quality and we got our espresso for free. I'll post back as soon as I try something new. Excellent pick if you like Italian food."
Sale E Pane,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-09-11,"At first I was wondering why my friend was celebrating at this cute little Italian place bit with every course it became more obvious. 
There is just nothing like eating the food from people who are passionate about their food. The recommendations are mouth-watering, the accompanying wine compliments the food perfectly and all of that paired with positive, friendly service and friends and you'll have an evening you will not forget. I highly recommend to have a chat with the people working here. 

Due to the size of our group I was able to see all the different dishes from antipasti, truffle pasta (), lemon-prosecco sorbet over the different main courses - fish, HUGE gambas & veal - to an outstanding dessert we covered it all. 

What a fantastic evening!"
Sale E Pane,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-10-13,We chose this restaurant for our wedding reception and it was fantastic. The restaurant looks wonderful. The atmosphere was very warm and the food was more than perfect. For the starter we had a selection of different antipasti. The main dish was Saltimbocca and pasta and kids had pizza and for the desert we had a selection of different desserts. We also brought our own wedding cake that was even served for us. The staff was very professional and extremely friendly - they really made our wedding day special. All together it was a value for money.
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,2017-09-15,"Amazing food!! Must go in Berlin!! Everything we tried were delicious. We had the spaghetti with scallop,shrimp and algae sauce, ravioli with black truffles, and the haddock (white fish) special with pumpkin pur?e and pear. Great service! Everyone was very friendly and attentive. The waiter explain every dish on the special menu in English. Highly recommended!!!!"
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,5,2014-10-31,I rarely write reviews but after the Hotel recommended Cavallino Rosso and we ate a meal there I had to say something nice.  The Owner ? meet us at the front door with gusto.  Not all the menu was in English so he explained the items with a lot of personal pride.  We wondered on several of the combinations such as Mushroom soup with a side of Herring.  The raviolis with Truffles were great and probably the first time I ever considered saying stop as the waiter was shaving them on.  Everything was very tasty.  The bill came and all the food was less than the nice bottle of wine.  truly great night out.
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,4,2013-01-03,"Gehobener Italiener, Bedienung manchmal etwas verpeilt. Essen besser als beim Italiener ums Eck, aber preislich auch anspruchsvoller. Im Sommer kann man draussen sitzen, ist aber halt recht laut, da dort zuegig gefahren wird. Frau Shavan schaut auch immer mal wieder vorbei arbeitet ja gegenueber :-)"
Cavallino Rosso,Italian,4.5,?21-40,2,2009-04-17,"Tiny portions, bland ambiance and uninterested service. This place could technically be a good Italian restaurant to stop in now and again. Unfortunately the food is mediocre and portions are so small that you'd think they were doing this intentionally to save money. Further, you have a bunch of politicians here around lunchtime which in and of itself isn't bad but it's just not my crowd. Many of them seem to be regulars and get better service. Oh well, there are plenty of better options in Berlin and in the vicinity. I won't be coming back."
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-07-15,"Handmade pasta was so good!
We had fresh made cheesecake which was amazing!
People working here are very nice and very friendly :)"
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2017-04-15,"This place is really a kids friendly place with fine selection of pizza and pasta. We asked the waiter to divide a pasta and a pizza on three plates, and no problems here at all. So five stars for that. 
We got a very greasy meat dish and an overcooked fish as main course, and combined with a poor wine card they get 3 stars. 
Remember to bring cash as the nearest ATM is quite far away."
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-11-20,One of our favorite little Italien restaurants. We enjoy the food as well as the great staff. I can recommend a visit anytime. The pizza and pasta are really good.
Trattoria Toscana,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2011-08-11,"- i came to this place on a tip that the people here are fantastic. aside from that being true, i can not even describe the tantalizing ways of the italian food. i just arrived from croatia where i thought the general food was second to none, and now i have found a restaurant where the food here is beyond the german standard itself and the pizza annihilates its croatian and italian competitors. the process from when you sit until the time you leave gives you a very warm and smooth feeling. bread with balsamico, olive oil and some chillis to your liking or if you must a salad or anti pasta to start, then your main course can go from a variety of Salmon dishes/pastas/pizzas/steaks with home grown spices and herbs, dessert(if you can manage after your meal) and a coffee or tea to finish. perfect. 5 stars + another 5 :)"
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-06-03,"Great service & amazing food
We, 3 persons, ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta. It was enough to feed cows!!! 
Tastes really good as well!!!"
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-09-25,"This is the real Italian style! Family run business, here since the ~80s.
Don't go anywhere else in Berlin: the best pizza is here. Huge sizes and fair price. Still quality is high! The pizza style is flat and crunchy, super easy to digest. 
As dessert, you should go for PannaCotta: despite the classic, it s not what you might have tried in other places. Tried to sneak out the recipe to the owner and waitress but that s a secret!"
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,5,2012-04-27,"Went here with a friend and we each ordered a pizza, thinking they were personal-sized. The pizzas are actually quite huge and both barely fit on the table. The pizzas were delicious and very much like the kind I've had in Italy with a thin, chewy crust. The waiter was very friendly and brought us complimentary olives before the meal. The place is kind of small, but there's good seating outside."
Valle Dei Templi,Pizza,4.5,?11-20,3,2010-02-09,"I tried this trattoria/pizzeria tonight as another restaurant I wanted to go to was shut. 
I ordered a Pizza dello Chef (pizza with prosciutto, ruccula and parmigiano). It was a very large sized pizza baked in a brick oven. I thought the prosciutto was sliced too thickly to be easily edible. I also thought the crust could have been a bit thinner as well."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-08-25,"We stumbled in to this cute restaurant, nestled on the corner of a street across from the river. The ambiance looked promising, and a quick peek at the menu - including daily specials - lured us in.

We sat outside. The lunch hour was busy but we were able to get a table in the shade. The wait staff are all Italian; they address you in English, Italian or German - as you prefer - and chitchat with each other in Italian as orders are made and delivered. 

We split a mozzarella di bufala & tomato salad, dressed in olive oil, balsamic reduction & basil leaves. Everything about it was correct - the cheese was perfectly supple, tomatoes ripe, dressing delicious. The house red wine was cheap (?3) and of great quality. I ordered a handmade pasta daily special (?17): spaghetti in broth with Parmesan cheese, shaved truffles & mushrooms. It was heavy but so good that I forced myself to finish. 

My dining partner ordered the pasta al forno (?8): baked penne in a cheese and red sauce with sausage and broccoli. She loved it. The table next door ordered pizzas; they looked stunning and I'm certain they tasted just as well. Whoever is in the kitchen knows what they're doing.

An espresso followed, along with a cone of gelato (yogurt & lemon flavors.... wonderful!). 

The menu had a wide variety of options - starters, appetizers, pasta, pizza & main dishes. Prices are moderate (?5-12 per dish, more for some specials/meat dishes). The staff were friendly, helpful & did an excellent job (Mario was our waiter... ladies, he's a cutie!). 

Our total check was ?44 - incredibly cheap for all that we had. The atmosphere transported us out of Berlin and in to Rome for a few hours... what a wonderful hidden gem!"
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,1,2017-08-21,"The food was good, but the waiter charged us extra 4.80 EUR for the credit card purchase, which was somewhat unexpected. Our German friends told us that this behavior is a crime as the tipping is not required, and we should have called the police. Moreover, this big old self-proud ""Italian"" (not at all!) waiter did everything he could to demonstrate that our lack knowledge of the German language is our big mistake, and we are treated as the lower-quality people because of that.

Gracias, the place like this teaches us to stop trusting people."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-04-02,"We were there for Valentine's Day. They had a really nice menu prepared for the day with 3 courses for a good price. 

We started with some bruschetta, then had some delicious pasta with saffron and finished it of with a tiramisu which could have been better for my taste, but since it was part of the menu, was ok.

The staff was ok. We had a really nice day waiter who was bringing us the food and also explained quite nicely everything we got. The other staff members were in a bit of a bad mood and we had to wait a while for the bill, but ok.

It is a nice place for a special occasion, but I wouldn't come there regularly."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2016-08-10,"Maybe we just catched a bad day of the restaurant, but I wouldn't go there ever again. Besides experiencing a very, very slow service (nothing happened until we called, and we had to many times) the waiters walked around or stood on the street, rather than looking after their ""beloved"" customers and asking if they need something.

The mixed salad and the fish salad were tourist-average, okay. But the main dishes were not good - noodles with mushrooms and with edible sea urchin didn't taste well at all. But the real catastrophe was the Pizza. I ordered a Diavolo and asked for extra garlic and rucola.
What I got was not hot, had no cheese and some lazy trainee cut garlic into 3 big chunks and threw them on the Pizza, along with old Basil leaves with some rucola. Worst Pizza I can remember! Really ruined my evening!

Actually this should be 1 star only as they charged the horrible Pizza even though I complained very clearly about it and they could actually take a look at their disaster Pizza themselves. NOT okay!!

In the end after complaining about the charge and waiting more than 15 minutes - there were many italian sorrys and excuses and explanations (""idiots in the kitchen"") - well at least that is something they are always good at... :-)

Don't eat there!"
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,3,2017-08-08,Great location and offers an adequate but somewhat pricey menu. Child-friendly which is great for families. Definitely worth a lunch or early dinner on the terrace in the sun!
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2017-08-21,The food was good. But they charged 5 euros because we paid by card. And waiters pretended they don't speak English.
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-05-16,"The food and drinks were exactly as you'd expect from a good restaurant (good ingredients, well prepared etc.--see the other reviews), but what gives this 5 stars from me was the cake for dessert. This was the best cake we've had in a week in Berlin--and we've been looking! Bravo. Another reviewer dissed their tiramisu, and maybe we were lucky and they weren't. That's why I gave 5 stars and they gave 4..."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-12,"I really love this italian restaurant, because it is very cozy, very traditional, the food is great: really, everything is just great! The staff is very polite and friendly, the service is all in all superb! In the summer, whenn sittinb outside one has a nice riverview.
The price is of coursw corresponding. That is the only aspect keeping me from going less often."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-05-12,"Wow, we had a simple pasta with shaved truffle but darn was it great! The lemon desert (go for the lemon desert, not the lemon ice-cream! Although the latter was good as well) was amazing. Good service and a limoncello on the house to boot."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,4,2014-11-02,"One of the best places to eat in the Tiergarten area. By accident, it happened to be one of the first restaurants in Berlin I went to for dinner and it is one that I'm happy to return to again and again whenever I'm in the area. It's not only one of the best places for pizza I've ever been to (and I'm a certified pizza connoisseur) but one of the better places to go to for Italian cuisine. 

The wait staff is always in a good mood and happy to serve. Since Feb of 2014 I've been here 7 or 8 times and have never had a bad experience. I was sticking to the amazing pizza menu for a while - I will never tire of the Diavola pie - but after having a pasta dish from the daily specials and experiencing some of the most tender and delicious cuts of beef to ever accompany pasta I'm now a devotee to the daily specials. I don't think they will steer you wrong. Their sauces are tremendous and if you have a chance to try the chicken stuffed with prosciutto, I highly recommend you do just that. 

Nothing on the menu costs much more than 20? (I think the most expensive dish I came across was 23?) so you and your lucky companion can get a great meal with a couple drinks for well under 50?. Enjoy."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,2,2014-06-29,"After ordering a cheese and spinach pizza and paying the waiter told us there was no more spinach. 
They made a different pizza and would not allow us to cancel the order. No refund, no discount.
The other pizzas we had ordered weren't bad but with that price I expect better service and I doubt I'll return."
Casa Matti,Italian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-05-03,"Fantastic, well priced Italian food with excellent service. Complementary starter of soft italian-style bread with chilli olives was very welcome. Pasta and pizza dishes are great value, with big, hearty portions using fresh ingredients at generally no more than 10 euros. The penne arrabiata was particularly good. Best about Casa Matti, however, is the service. Attentive, polite, and courteous - something very hard to find in Berlin."
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2014-09-04,"One of my favourite retaurants in Berlin. It's not shabby, not pricey and so authentic that the waiter is speaking Chinese with me. (Sadly I can't reply in Chinese) 

I often come here for the chicken feet. (Leave me alone I love them ok?) Beside that they have great lunch deals which go from 12:00 - 16:00 and cost about 6-7?. I can highly recommend the fried rice or the noodlepots. Latter are HUGE and so so good. You get a tablet with a bowl of broth, a bowl with rice noodles and several small plates with toppings suchs as mushrooms, seaweed or walnuts. I usually have the vegetarian one with a lot of veggies but the ones with meat looked pretty good as well.
This place is compared to other chinese restaurants like ""Good Friends"" (which is close by) more quiet and elegant. The interior looks high class- almost posh and the restaurant owner is super nice. I think that's a place where you can drop by with your parents are some special date.

All in all a great place!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2016-11-06,"So far I tried only ""Crossing the bridge"" soups, but they are outstanding. You get a huge bowl of broth, another bowl with crazy amounts of rice noodles and a set of ingredients you can add , they differ depending on the type of soup. It's definitely not the cheapest but worth the price. I would just prefer it to have a little less noodles and more extra ingredients like meat slices or nuts. But I am still very happy with this place. Exceptionally good for a hangover!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,2,2017-01-27,"It's a basic family restaurant style. We visit for first time and expected at least fresh vegetables and healthy food. Taste was just soso, however sprouts and peanuts turned already bad. We will not come back."
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2015-10-22,"One of the best asian restaurants in Berlin (seriously) . The soups are between 6 to 10 Euro and are so huge (even by american standards) that it's usually a good idea to split the soup with someone else, which they will happily let you do. You might even consider ordering the aubergine and pork dish which is another standout. Also have more exotic stuff like pig feet which aren't bad."
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2017-07-24,"The food and service were both outstanding  I highly recommend this place. 

It is a quiet little restaurant with a relaxing atmosphere. The service was great. They brought our dishes out on a warmer so we could take our time eating and it never got cold. 

They have a great selection of dishes and drinks. So if you're looking for a place with great prices and great food, this is it!"
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2015-03-31,Good pricess and good chinese food. I have only went there for a take-away meal. Perfect for that.
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2013-03-08,"We go here almost every week since we have moved in this neighborhood. The typical decorated spacy place is purely family-driven, owner Si Mei is very very friendly. The food is mandarin cuisine, just excellent and prizes are absolutely low. My recommendation is the hot plate with prawns."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-10-10,"Authentic Northern Chinese cuisine ... even the atmosphere is authentic (ie more Neon than nostalgic ;) ) Chinese. Great food with pork as mainstay. Oh, and craft beers. Best to come with at least 3 diners to samples some variety (Chinese, not European dishes served here)."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2018-01-25,Went to DJL for dinner. Authentic Chinese food and service was pretty good too. Food was served fast.
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,2,2017-06-11,"If this is the best Chinese food that Berlin had to offer... wow... maybe someone should take a trip to China. 

Although the service was friendly and the menu seeming authentic with the inclusion of a few north eastern Chinese dishes, this is meals are aimed at the German palate, if your palate favors the toning down of flavors this place is for you. 

When it comes to looking for authentic tasting food, I'll steer clear of local reviewers thanks. Although I did have pretty tasty Chinese food in Frankfurt, so maybe it's just a Berliner thing."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-09-22,"Authentic cuisine, pretty good! We enjoyed the cucumber salad/ dumplings/ salt and pepper prawns/ bok choy w shiitake/ sour soup fish."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-02-09,"Relatively cheap and pretty authentic chinese restaurant. The servers are super nice and friendly so I want to give 5 stars for that.

Food was also pretty authentic although the choice was a bit limited. The duck was pretty good and crispy but yuxiangrousi ???? was a bit too sweet. The fried rice was ok. And the bokchoy and mushroom was good ????. Guobai ?? was great (i believe the place is ?? dongbei food. They also gave us free white rice! 

The food took a while to come out and the choice was somehow more limited than in the Bay area/california (i know this sounds weird since they have pages of food but they lack some super common authentic chinese dishes--- which to be fair not many people might order those here?) 

Otherwise, super good service, tasty food at decent price! Cannot ask for more for a chinese restaurant in Berlin!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-04-04,"Very good place for dinner, friendly servers, some dishes can serve up to two people. I recommend asking for the spring roll of entry - 2.80 euros. Recommend the dish with chicken fingers and vegetables - 9.90 euros."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-11-20,"Very authentic Chinese restaurant. Everything is well prepared and tasty, even the ""Westernized"" dishes.
Service is a bit quirky but friendly. Totally recommended"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-06-27,"This restaurant is a little out of the way but totally worth the trek. The food is very good and the service is wonderful. If you're unsure, the front part of the menu has photos of each item to help with your decision. If you want good Chinese food while in Berlin, Da Jia Le is worth a stop."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-06-12,"I've bookmarked this for the longest time, and finally, I got the chance to get here. Oh, how wonderful!

It's always a joy to find a Chinese restaurant that doesn't tailor its cuisine to the ""needs"" of the local population. Hence, when I was living in the US, I always sought these little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants because I didn't really dig General Tso's Chicken. And so here in Berlin, I am glad to have found this.

One tip: if you ever try and eat here, don't order from the menu that has no pictures. Order from the menu that has pictures. The picture-less menu is your standard Chinese fare that you would expect every Chinese restaurant would carry. But the menu with the pictures, those are the bomb!

We ordered three dishes which we shared between the two of us. We ordered the beef tripe (D03), the seaweed salad (D12), and the pork belly stewed in tomatoes with glass noodles (D33). All the dishes were amazing!

And surprisingly, they also have quite a good selection of German craft beers, which definitely work well with the hot dishes that they have!

I would definitely try to be back here when I can. But first I'll try to exercise and burn away this meal I ate."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-04-06,"I like the food here. You can choose between the western Chinese style or the transitional style. Both of them taste good for me. 

Das Essen schmeckt mir gut. Mann kann zwischen der westlichen chinesischen Art und der traditionellen chinesischen Art ausw?hlen. Beide gefallen mir. Lecker. :)"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-07-16,"After living in Beijing for almost 4 years then moving to Berlin 2.5 years ago I've been craving REAL Chinese food and I'm very pleased to say I've found it! 

Authentic dishes,  superb flavours and very nice staff (they even kindly put up with my terrible out of practice Chinese!). Another delightful surprise was the great selection of craft beers on their menu BONUS! But I stayed faithful and had a Tsingtao to truly have my ? Chinese fix. 

Do yourself a favour and go eat some real Chinese food,  you will not regret it."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-02-13,"Well tickle me pink!  I had gone past this restaurant so many times and thought ummm meh because I have to admit it's not so welcoming looking from the outside. I also peered through the windows at night whilst passing in the car a couple of times and thought nah! Then I saw the reviews on yelp and thought seriously?

Having joined the yelp community and met some of the reviewers I thought...Yes seriously this must be good. So I took my little cold to try out something spicy.

Well we only ordered three dishes, I would have liked to have gone all Asian but I would have needed the stomach of a cow with it's four chambers to get through it all... on that subject you can indeed order stomach, trotters, tripe and the like should you so wish. We ordered Sichuan Style Tofu, Peking styled fried pork with pancakes and the Pork, shrimp, egg and vegetable dumplings. 

The dumplings were a good size and tasty. The tofu was firm and had a lovely spice to it, just right to unblock my nose! The pork wrapped in pancakes was delicious too. Portions are generous and we were really quite stuffed. Thankfully my friend knows me quite well and stopped me ordering by the third dish otherwise I would still be there eating now! I liked this place very much and will return to try other dishes. But my main mission will be to find people who have a stomach for the more adventurous side of the menu. Really want to try their intestines, hope it's like how my father used to make them. So many dishes to try! Just happy this place is so nearby and to think I have been searching for so long! 

Prices are a little on the steep side but I have to come to terms with that when it comes to Chinese food unless you get a greasy noodle box from some public transport station, but that is a whole different ball game!

Oh I should also mention they have an impressive selection of craft beers too!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-02-27,"The food was really good and the service was great! My favourites were duck with shrimps and for desert the caramelised sweetpotatoes!
Wonderful!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-03-30,"Probably some of the best Chinese I've had in Berlin... I can't say I've tried every place but everything I ordered was really fresh and tasty. The portions were actually quite large as well so you get your money's worth!

Also they have some local craft beer selections which is a plus!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-01-08,"Last time I tried the Sichuan-style chicken, which blew me away. I needed to give them one more star just for that dish.

I asked them about Hunan food in Berlin and they recommended another place not too far away which I tried, too."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-06-09,"I ate here last week and had a really delicious meal.  The restaurant is in a kind of odd location - just down from the Yorkstrasse station in an area of mostly apartment buildings and sp?ti.  It took us a second to figure out how to get inside the restaurant...turns out there are sliding doors on the right!  The interior is nothing special, just the typical Chinese restaurant stuff, but it was quiet and the booths felt intimate. 

The menu is quite large!  I had difficulty picking something out from all of the options.  Eventually we settled on a chicken and a pork dish (I don't remember the names because they were Chinese!) and some pork & shrimp dim sum.  Both of our dishes were awesome!  Especially the pork, which was cut into very thing strips like straws.  The dim sum was very good but it took a loooong time to come out; we had nearly finished our entrees before it was delivered. 

One cool thing about this place is that they serve craft beer!  I was impressed with the beer selection and, although I opted for a Rollberg on draft this time, was excited to see so many unique options. 

All in all, it was really nice and I would definitely go back!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-06-20,"This place is incredible! I live only 2 blocks away and just discovered the place! The waitress was super friendly and the food was exceptional! 
I never write reviews on Yelp, but This place was too good for me not to. 
If you want delicious authentic Chinese food with big portions, this is the place to GO!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-05-23,"Food: Authentic, delicious, and freshest ingredients. 
Drinks: Selected craft beers and top notch wines for an affordable price.
Service: Run by a sweet and friendly family.
Perfection!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-04-29,"Wow, this is a great chinese restaurant. Already when you enter the restaurant you somehow feel you are in China. The decor is a bit tacky and the place itself has a very large dining room with a lot of tables. The food is really great, I would rate it as the best Chinese food I had in Berlin. We went for the cold potato salad and the squid for starters, both excellent. For mains we had some steamed fish and fried sweet and sour pork. The dishes were just excellent and on top of all this great food this place also has a craft beer list that matches some fancy bars in Berlin. A full thumbs up in every aspect."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-05-20,One thing for sure. Check their fish menu! Everything is the next-door-girl but their Fish is a diva.
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-09-22,"We've eaten Chinese in lots of place around the world and this ranks easily in the top 3. My wife had gong pao chicken and I had the fried black pepper beef; both were superb. Veggies sweet and crunchy, meat cooked to perfection. We also has an order of baked shrimp crackers--marvelous. 

And the service was attentive and efficient and very prompt. Perhaps prompted by reviews here, waiter told us tip was not included.

Highly recommended."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-08-04,"I give this place a solid 4 stars. I went to this spot during their lunch hours so I was able to order from their lunch menu. The prices were super reasonable with their lunch menu. Each person's meal ranged from 7 to 10 euros. 

I ordered their fried tofu. As far as my drink, I opted for their rose blossom tea. I recommend both of these options for lunch. In total I paid about 12 euros for my drink and lunch. The fried tofu is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce is kind of salty. Thus, I would have wanted more rice. I suggest you order an extra bowl of rice to counter the salty level of the tofu dish."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2016-09-30,"They don't actually stay open as late as they say. Hours aren't accurate. We arrived a half hour before the listed closing time, and we weren't allowed to be seated. Despite telling him that his hours posted on the door indicate the restaurant is open, we were turned away. Don't waste your time."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-09-11,"Wow! Good food and service- actually some of the best we found in Berlin. Vegetable options, English and German menus, high quality food. Highly recommend."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2017-08-24,"OK food, but terrible service! Wait forever to get my check. Be careful, they'll secretly add tips on your bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2017-02-28,I had such high hopes due to all the great reviews. And I got disappointed. Had a soso honey pork dish which really didn't flash me at all. The sugar peas where rather spare and overall the dish was pretty bland. Bummer!
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2016-05-14,"I only order one thing , but it's not good
There's Expensive meal but using cheaper material, the yuxiang shredded pork should with carrots but they are using bean sprouts which maybe cheaper and really minimum agaric I only can find three piece in the meal, does make this meal really not good, I don't think I will come back again"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-09-24,"Delicious Chinese in Berlin. We had the dim sum and jelly fish for starters, then the kung pao chicken and duck for our main courses and the green tea with toasted rice to drink. All of it was very good, though we'll order it spicier next time. Highly recommended!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-08-30,The ubiquity of Chinese restaurants in every town I've been to dulls the senses a little towards what's going to be eaten. This place woke up my taste buds with dishes that were traditional but still new to me. It helped that I visited with some Chinese friends who ordered without really looking at the menu. I won't attempt to make any recommendations but needless to say everything we are was top notch and at a reasonable price. Recommended.
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-01-23,"I was seated quickly and the meal was brought about 5 minutes after ordering.  Had the sweet and sour chicken.  It was served different than what I am used to, but I enjoyed it.  Price was around 12 euros. Berliner tap beer was cold and awesome.

The waiters did disappear for 45 minutes and I had trouble getting the bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-07-02,"This is a really good Chinese place in Berlin. We had a variety of dishes, and all of them were very good. I'm 1/2 Chinese. The Peking Duck was actually quite authentic, contrary to some reviews, and the Bok Choy, Hong Shao Qie Zi (?????soy sauce braised eggplant), and Kung Pao Chicken were all fantastic. The service was good as well. They have English menus upon request. Free shot of plum wine at the end of the meal was nice. I'd definitely come back here."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2015-07-03,"The food here is good, and they have a special menu for the hot summer, but the service is strange, and I feel bewildered and neglected. Maybe I'm too accustomed to dining in the US, I just wished when I sat down, someone could come over and ask me what I'd like to drink. But the waiter just left me with a menu and left. It took some time and work to get their attention when I wanted to order. 

Moreover, tips are included in the total amount on my bill, which my German friend told me is unusual and never heard of in Germany."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2014-09-29,"Tried this place last night because of briefly reading a few reviews and I was not impressed. Being on Chinese decent living in Vancouver Canada where we been told we have the best Chinese food outside of China. This place was a disappointment and I hate to say the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We had a few starters soup, dumplings, fried noodles etc. which was different I was jot impressed. Waiting for our main coarse Peking duck to arrive I was hopeful and excited by saying they can't mess this up unless they change the sauce... They did instead of the classic housin sauce I Dunno what they gave us but left a chalky aftertaste. Bill came to 76 Euros!

Maybe my standards are high being from where I'm from but sorry this place is terrible. Don't say you haven't been warned."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2013-06-05,"One of the best Chinese joints I've been to in Europe.

Dirt cheap and the food is great. The menu is authentic and bountiful including very good dim sum, szechuan specialties and of course Peking duck with pancakes.

The duck was fairly moist and crispy. Everything else was fantastic. The eggplant in chili oil and garlic with cilantro was dreamy.

I wanted to order the entire menu and actually look forward to going back next time I'm in Berlin!!

Unfortunately, the service sucked, otherwise it would have deserved 5 stars!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-02-14,"It's one of those places made me wish there were more stars on Yelp reviews. Looks like a regular chinese place, but it's a gem. We tried lamb (don't know name showed picture in Yelp to order), duck with peanut souce, seaweed salad and dumplings. All excellent. Haven't eaten that good chinese in ages. Staff is nice and place is big and spacious too. They suggested wine with our food (no kidding), and I was surprised how it complimented food.

PS to bad mouthing chinese: Yeah you can eat better chinese in China. Too bad it's a trillion hour flight."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-09-28,"this is probably the worst restaurant i've ever been to, anywhere in the world. this includes the taco bell that consistently made me sick as a kid....

i've been in europe for almost 3 weeks now and was craving some chinese food, so found this place on yelp with 4 stars and 150 reviews, so figured it was a solid pick. we get there and are seated instantly (although we didnt have reservations, b/c they asked lol). it took a few minutes for our waitress but got drinks and food on order and waited. 

first up, XLB, because i have to eat XLB anywhere it is served (who doesn't?!). XLB was good but not soupy, but hey, it's germany, not shanghai or NYC. 

our entrees arrived and it's a bit weird. i ordered ""crispy fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce."" what i got was a fillet of fried chicken cut up, and then on top of it, another fillet of sesame encrusted chicken, also cut up. ok, that's cool i guess. then i get a bowl of sweet and sour sauce. 

this whole time, there's some fruit flies around, but when i pour out soy sauce (luckily on my plate b/c i wasn't sure if it was vinegar) there were *several* dead flies in it! holy smokes! my parents are with me and now aghast. the waitress that i told was like ""oh, yeah, ok ill get you a new one."" seems this is a known issue...

my dad got crispy duck and noted that it wasn't good, like it had been reheated. after leaving and reading additional reviews it seems we're not alone in that thinking. 

we got our check and left, but noted they added service on the bill of around 8%. i spend quite a bit of time in europe and i've only seen that at high end places, not places like this. no one on the team ever asked how the meal was or seemed concerned we barely ate anything. quite a horrible experience."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-07-13,"Extremely unfriendly waiters. We sat down on the terrace and they tried to move us to another table because they didn't want to walk the extra couple of meters to serve us. When we said we prefer to stay at that table they said we need to move because of our pram with our one month old daughter (sleeping by the way, so no annoying crying etc) was in the way. We just left."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-03-29,"Food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy, bland, and came out cold. Also, their staff were some of the rudest servers I've ever encountered. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-11-07,"Food was extremely salty. I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but I had to send my mapo tofu back. I could not eat more than a spoonful. When I told the server I wanted to cancel my order (not replace it) he reacted with a confused frowning face saying 'I tasted it, it's not salty. It's normal '. At least when I reiterated that it was in fact salty and I didn't want it he took it away and I wasn't charged for it. I was however shocked to see that they had added a tip to our bill (around 10% if I remember right). I have not seen this so far anywhere else in my two weeks here in Berlin. This includes more upscale establishments and restaurants serving us as a party of 10 or more (we were only 4 at peking ente).

As I side note, I understand that bottled water is part of the culture in Europe. But stating explicitly that you don't serve tap water and making the food this salty seems a big suspect."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2013-12-19,"5 stars??!!  Really?!  This place is overpriced and sub par.  
While visiting berlin we relied in this restaurant's stellar yelp reviews to make a dinner choice. If this is the best that Berlin has to offer, I suggest replacing all meals with bread and beer. We specifically ordered the specialties of the house in order to get the most authentic experience possible. The meal was just the opposite.  The soup and dumplings were good but nothing to write home about. The perch was over salty and totally overpowered by it's heavy brown sauce, the sweet and sour chicken was lightly breaded but the sauce was equivalent any US takeout, ditto for the roast At 32 euros The Peking duck was a rip off so we didn't even bother. The interior was a little better than average but the neighborhood and building looked like the ghetto."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-12-13,"Delicious Chinese food from Sichuan and Canton. The different kinds of Dim Sum variations are awesome.

This is place to be if you like to enjoy Dim Sum."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2018-01-06,"They made the best hot and sour soup of my life. Nice casual and elegant setting. Service is quick, if not brusk. They could improve upon the friendliness. They seem well equipped for large groups. I saw many tables were already reserved. The red curry was good but not great."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-10-24,"When you visit an Asian restaurant and you are the only non Asians eating...you know you are eating at the right place. Great atmosphere, good location and amazing food. We had the dinner for two and it was extremely filling... could have been for three or four light eaters. We left a lot of food. If your looking for not Chinese not Thai not Japanese... but something like it... this Asian hits the spot!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-10-19,"I joked that this is the place in Berlin where all the veggies go. People crow about the duck here, but the veg red curry and clay pot were both amazing. Full of a wide variety of veggies, really fantastic flavors, silky tofu. Never thought I'd love Thai curry at a Chinese place but the red curry was excellent. Bay Area, CA born and raised so I'm used to both cuisines, in their restaurant form. Spice level is decent if slightly dumbed down for the northern EU taste. This was the only place we ate in a Berlin that I could see myself returning to regularly. Really quite lovely. Oh. And FAST."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-11-10,"I was in Berlin in early October. My niece and I toured the Museum Island. We found Jolly nearby, with pretty good reviews, so we decided to have lunch here. We ordered crisp duck, small steamed dumplings, spicy lamb and mushroom/vegetables. What a surprise! Every dish was delicious! My niece studied in Germany for years and now works in Hamburg. She said this was her one of her most favorable Chinese meals. We at Chinese and I am from NYC area. That tells you how good the food was! We highly recommend this restaurant!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-11-07,"We had a lovely dinner at Restaurant Jolly! 
The interior was like a fine dining restaurant.
It was kind of funny how they had candlelit dinner tables with a romantic setting and people were chowing down with their chopsticks and rice bowls haha.
We came here as they are famous for their peking duck. It was really good! 
We were starved after a full day of touring around Berlin and finished the day off dining here. 
Service was excellent.

I'd recommend the:
* Sweet & sour soup
* Peking duck
* Stir-fry veggies

Also, a note to travellers.. they have free wifi! :D"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-09-03,"Good Asian food for Berlin, good Asian food period. German food is sorely lacking in spices and after a week of wursts and potatoes, s schezuan  kick to the  stomach was very welcome. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Dim sum even, not half bad."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-02-13,"I went tonight with a group of 10... (We where here for the Berlin film festival. )  .. Amazing food. We had Duck, eggplant, more duck, Beef with veggies, fish with veggies, Duck, rice,  Dumplings, chicken... The best tasting Chinese food.. We loved it.... Best spot in Berlin... A+  A  recommend.. Get the duck lol... (Tea, the sesame balls, wine, etc... I will be back."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-08-21,"Really delicious food. Big portions. Great atmosphere. Overall, would certainly recommend."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,2,2017-07-22,"As an Chinese American, this restaurant seemed to have treated me like some disowned family member. Almost no attention was given to me.  I was given a small corner table while the German/white customers got the roomy tables - even for 2
Person groups. 

The hot and sour soup has a TOMATO base!  Definitely not authentic.  

The Jolly tofu pot was passable.  Interestingly used spam.  No shrimp. 

On the positive side, the tables and chairs and whole ambiance was good.  Just that they have some sort of reverse discrimination.  

If you r Asian, u know what to expect. Not fully authentic Chinese food and possible poor treatment."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-04-18,"A really good choice for Asian food in Berlin. 
The food is very tasteful and staff is super nice and helpful. The dishes are enormous. We were 4 people  and didn't manage to finish more than half of the food, so a tip would be to perhaps start with one dish to share (if couple) - then add another one if still hungry.. Or have starters before sharing."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-03-06,A good variety of Asian regional food grouping. All items on the menu where good portions and rich on flavors. Still an authentic place that keeps some traditions in place. Certainly a place to repeat!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-04-05,I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 and the place was not packed at all. Amazing value and great atmosphere. I ordered the lunch special with duck and noodles for around 8 euro. It was delicious!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-07-07,"This restaurant is a must-try! I have never before had authentic Chinese food outside of China - until I went to Jolly! 
A little expensive but great food. 

I had dinner here with my boyfriend to celebrate an anniversary. We met in China, so we decided to have Chinese food. We ordered the roasted duck with prawns and vegetables, beef with black pepper and silk tofu. All dishes were great! I would probably order duck without prawns next time though since they didn't taste much, or try the Peking duck!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-12-31,"We (2ppl) ordered the set menu for two, a bottle of water, two large beers and a small beer all together at 43 ?. the set was as a whole very delicious and highly recommended. the servings and the pacing between dishes was good. I usually eat a lot and was skeptical there would be enough food to fill my appetite--there was, and with leftovers! The ambient is calm and stylish. 

The set included:
-sweet and sour soup
-4 egg rolls
-the main dishes (breaded duck and beef stir fried) served on the same platter and with a large bowl of rice
-vanilla ice cream with deep-fried bananas"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-04-13,"Solid Chinese food. All that's missing are some more pork dishes, such as some crispy belly ;)

Their Peking Duck is the thing to go for, but everything else I tried over a few visits were all good. For Chinese in Berlin, very good even. 

Efficient service too and nice to be able to look into the kitchen."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-10-02,"I would have never imagined that I would I'd end up having Chinese food in Berlin!  In any case, after a long day of touring Museuminsel on a chilly spring day, this was the closest restaurant to the island we could find, so we figured to give it a try. It ended up being a good decision!

Being Chinese, I think I can validate the authenticity of its food. We especially loved the dim sum choices that were offered as part of the menu. After weeks of traveling in Europe, this was my first taste of home! For less than ?30, we had quite a feast for two!

The restaurant was surprisingly crowded on a weekday night. There was a mix of tourists and German business people. I'm taking a star off for its ridiculously slow service and lack of menus. The table next to us waited literally 20 minutes to get a menu! And we waited just about the same time to put down our order. The friendliness of the waiters and manager made up for the slow service in the end, though."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-04-10,"Amazing crispy duck and dim sum. My partners soup was good as well. Nice ambiance and friendly service. The duck was enormous, easily enough for two with appetizers. Two drinks, two apps and a main course came to 32 euro. Well worth it!!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-12-29,"Possibly one the best... neigh, thee greatest Asian food I've had in Europe, would honestly consider a trip back to Berlin just to eat here. The sweet and sour duck with lychee was amazing, along with the duck curry, and fried noodle with chicken, top tier. Duck game strong tho. Would recommend again and again."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-06-20,"Great food and nice place, staff looked very bored though."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-09-30,"very delicious! especially all kinds of local Cantonese style DIM-SUM, which stands out among other chinese restaurant~"
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-07-06,"Visiting from New York City  for only five days and was lucky enough to be brought to this exquisite restaurant by my friend Jake. Better than any of the restaurants back home - freshest flavors and most delicious combinations I've encountered. Tofu has never tasted so good - whether quickly deep fried or saut?ed or smoked. Shumai and wontons were perfect and light and wasabi shrimp out of this world.  And how can a humble cucumber salad be that amazing?
Gracious service; beautiful outdoor setting, lovely bottle of Albari?o and above all scrumptious food. A must."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-02-25,"Like just : AMAZING ! 
once you go there ...you'll just wish /want to move to Berlin just to be able to try all dishes EVERY DAY !
on top of being delicious they are decorated in such an exquisite and elegant way that can only assure you ""you won't be disappointed""
hope you will all enjoy as much as i did. definitely recommendable! 
service is super sweet, the place has a great decoration, all is very clean
my best advise is : GO ! GO ! GO!  TRY! TRY!"
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,2016-12-09,"Nothing special. It's pretty much your average Chinese place, but a bit more expensive. The dim sum is better than the Hauptgerichte."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,1,2016-04-02,"Really confused by the reviews and I am not even a foodie.  I had their version of Kung Po chicken and it was almost inedible and the dish was about 50% oyster sauce with very little meat.  They do have a nice outdoor eating area if you just want to have a beer, but I would stay away from the food if you are remotely used to real Chinese food."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-06-11,"This is difficult for me to admit, but yes-I am a closet yelper. I have rarely been satisfied enough by my meal to consider cracking open the door of repression and sharing my experiences with others, and lesser times yet without the influence of alcohol, but the meal I enjoyed at this restaurant tonight is worth sober-waving a rainbow colored (or whatever series of colors yelp lurkers are represented by) flag for. 

I am a cheap person and was delighted to find reasonably priced food. You can expect to pay about 10 euros per person if you only order entrees. My wife and I consumed our meal family buffet style, which this restaurant is really made for.

If you're timid and may be concerned about ordering authentic Chinese, there is no need to be here. The menu is spelled out in a few languages, including English, and every dish also has its picture next to it. Better yet, the food that comes out actually looks like the picture! They have the typical Chinese dishes (i.e.  sweet and sour chicken) for you to fall back on if cat tongue or whatever (they don't actually serve cat tongue... On the menu anyways. If they did I would consider getting it because everything looks delicious) doesn't quite do it for your palette. 

We had the sweet and sour chicken as well as the double fried pork, both of which were great. It was nice to be able to flip back and forth between a sweet and a savory dish. Most items like our chicken or pork also come with white rice. There are other options in back of the menu (noodles, fried rice) that are served as a stand alone dish. 

The service was quick, something I haven't experienced in Europe yet either. They have a more secluded section then another section that houses a ~60 inch TV. They adjusted the volume according to our preference and we watched Mulan a couple of times. Just kidding, it was some soccer match. 

Although I didn't receive a fortune cookie to tell me that sunshine is a ray of hope or that new friends are just around the corner, I was impressed enough to creep out of the bowels of my dark hole, break the silence, share my feelings, cover myself with feathers, lead the parade, and wave the flag for Lao Xiang."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-09-22,We enjoyed the cold wood ear salad/ fish congee/ pork buns/ cumin lamb. Cool atmosphere
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,2017-06-28,"3* is for the nice staff.  Food really is disappointing.  Not quality ingredients & uses cheap substitutes.  Dishes came out different than in the menu pictures.  We have a Chinese speaking Chinese talking to the waitress & hoping the food we ordered will be ""for Chinese"".  Disappointed it came out still ""European"" Chinese food.  Using the wrong ingredients just didn't bring the right tastes.  

Staff is nice, presentation of the food is nice.  But I wish it had more good taste than looks."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-02-14,"Do try the double fried pork, it's slightly spicy and amazing. Its not like anything you've tried before!
Of course if you feel like eating chicken or frog legs, oyster or octopus Lao Xiang is the place for all of them.
The place is quite big, has even a private golden room and the service is nice."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-12-29,"to be honest, Chinese food is not my most favourite cuisine but I simply love this restaurant. I fell in love with their visually magnificent menu cards. and the food is terrific. I'm so lucky it's right next to the corner of my flat that I could come as much as I want."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-11-23,Great authentic Chinese food. Also try the hotpot which is actually not on the menu. Random funny note: The Xi'an warrior near to the bathroom is holding a Germany flag - not sure why.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-03-22,"I love this place, definitely he most authentic Chinese in Berlin. Have the feuertopf which is not on the menu (ask for it), it is great for a few friends and great value. The dumplings are some of the best I have tried. Menu might seem expensive bit courses are about sharing then having on your own."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-11-03,Really good Chinese hot pot!! Other things on the menu looked good too but were a bit pricy. Awesome place to eat at on a cold day and they have wifi!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-08-18,"Truly authentic Chinese food, with Hunan focus. Very reasonably priced and nice atmosphere.
 In summertime also relaxed seating outside."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2014-01-05,We had a great experience in this place located next to the train station in Prenzlauer Berg. The prices are quite inexpensive. Service is very attentive and dedicated. Portions are quite big. Food is quite tasty and the menu is quiet big. Maybe not the most authentic Chinese food that you can find but certainly a good value for your buck.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-07-24,"Well, I don't know what authentic Chinese food is, because I've never been to China, but this was really fantastic. We ordered two main courses, which turned out to be A LOT of food, and I think it's common for people to share a main course and get a starter. But I am so happy to have a really good restaurant in the neighborhood finally.
I want to try most of the things on the menu, and some of them are a bit scary for Western palates (chicken feet and frog meat included) but in the end we just had a beef stew and a lamb thing that we finished.
I look forward to eating there many more times in the future."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-07-11,Actually address is Wichartstrasse 43. Fantastic family-run Chinese restaurant from south China. Excellent authentic food reasonably priced. One of my really regular places. I am eating thru the ENTIRE menu!!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2013-08-14,Mit dem Lao Xiang hat sich endlich ein authentisches Chinarestaurant in den Pberg gewagt und ich hoffe es wird belohnt. Sehr leckeres Essen jenseits von Ente S??-Sauer oder H?hnchen mit Reis. Wir hatten als Vorpeise die Jiaozi (mit Schwein gef?llte Teigtaschen) und als Hauptgerichte das doppelt gebackene Schweinefleisch und den Tofu mit Schweine- und Rindfleisch. Alles war sehr lecker und in anst?ndigen Portionen! Hungrig geht hier also niemand raus :-) Preis-Leistungs-Verh?ltnis ist auch sehr in Ordnung inkl. netter Bedienung. Den einen Punkt Abzug gibt es nur f?r das etwas kalte und minimalistische Ambiente im Restaurant. Alles in allem: absolute Empfehlung!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2013-12-25,"Searching for a new restaurant for tonight, we found this one and tried it the first time. Interior is modern and nice. The menu offers lots of authentic dishes and the photos shown are quite close to what you get. The choice of dishes is a bit wider than other chinese restaurants, most of them being hunan style. We tried a lot and it was very good compared to other chinese restaurants in Berlin. The spicy cucumber has a great unique taste, and all dishes came in their original hot and spicy taste. They even had very yummy durian fruit desserts. Service was very friendly and fast, just the boss hasn't been so friendly, but just showed up once. So with really nice food and service, also reasonable price, we enjoyed the evening a lot. This one is in the top league for Berlin. Now we tried it some more times and enjoyed the same nice experience. We will come back to try more Definitely worth a try for all who are missing chinese/sichuan/hunan food here and are too lazy to cook at home."
Green Flavor,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-05-31,Good service and even better food. I had the wontons in chili oil to start. And then the noodles with pork and shrimp and vegetables. Was fantastic.
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-08-11,Their noodles are honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavors are earthy and sophisticated and the food is super fresh and a lot is made daily like the noodles and broth. The food here has a great mix of textures and flavors that come together perfectly. Their desserts are super amazing too - not too sweet and also very aromatic. Seriously you will not be disappointed!
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-03-10,"This is an amazing place for fans of genuine Chinese (Sichuan) food. Taste and authenticity is the focal point here, and the staff's love for food shines through in all dishes. The ""Ahorn"" noodle dish is recommended!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-06-15,"Probably the best food all along the Brunnenstr. Had tried soups and noodles dishes, and they are all great. It's possible to discover up to 10 different flavors inside a simple baked potato. One of my favorites recently."
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-12-09,The noodles are spectacular. One of the best new additions to the Berlin food scene.
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-02-26,"Elegant, charming ambience. Cozy, intimate and full of beauty. The owners are super nice, make you feel right at home. And the food, oh the food is spectacular! I've been here four times already and it has been consistently good. Just the right balance of flavor, spice and home cooked goodness. Just delicious!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,2016-12-08,"Peaceful ambience. Organic concept. The corner booth cubicals are an enriched idealism that in reality is quite uncomfortable; ambitious cross-leggers may suit these tables. Plating technique was beautiful but heavily lacked in flavor and depth. Service was very kind however, and as it is a new Restaurant it would surely evolve into something spectaular in the future."
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-11-04,"It's difficult to find a good dimsum place in Berlin. Not only are they usually pricy, but they're also not as tasty as what you'd find in the US or UK (outside of China of course).

This little jem is a great find. They really meant it when they say hausgemacht, they're true to their word: fresh homemade dimsum! It took a bit of time to get our meals, but it was worth the wait; it's also how you know they're actually made fresh. And the cost is reasonable (I wouldn't say cheap - it's Europe after all).

We had just the basics: har gaw, siu mai, and char siu bao - just a quick stop. We're definitely coming back to try the other items."
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-08-13,"One of the best Asian cuisines we have ever been to. We ordered family style and nothing remained on the table at the end. Highly recommend this place, our first real stop in Berlin! The location is in a great area, much happening here."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-03-21,The food is exceptional and the service quick/friendly.   We ordered vegetarian food and left quite satisfied.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Be sure to get a reservation on peak nights as the restaurant is usually very busy.
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-11-29,"Originally wanted to try a Korean restaurant nearby but it was fully booked on a Saturday night so we settled for Chinese. The place was pretty full as well so we sat at the bar. We ordered dumpling in Sechuan sauce, steamed halibut and spicy beef stew and finished off with steamed rice balls and sesame ice cream as dessert. All dishes were pretty authentic and tasty but the streamed fish was the standout."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-01-16,"A place I could easily visit daily! The food is exceptional , the staff are more than friendly and talkative too! Happy to speak in English as well as German .  I feel extremely welcomed and more than satisfied when I leave . A massive thank you"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-08-02,"This is the most authentic Chinese restaurant we've found in Germany. ?????????????????309 sichuan style chilli chicken is just so good, crispy and tasty. And the place is very easy to find. With nice decorations and light."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-07-19,Very nice place with great food. I said I wanna spicy so the waiter asked for extra spicy for me. Very thoughtful. If you are looking for a place that down to earth but has very good food. This is the best choice around the neighbourhood.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-12-29,"It indeed is a place that you can take a look if you really want some Chinese food in Berlin.

But the service here is extremely bad. A fat short-hair ~30-year-old male waiter here is a living definition of how bad the service can be provided. He ignored requests of customers and he was lazy and bad-tempered. He looks like a king in the restaurant but he is actually a pig: he only smiled at young ladies and frowns at male customers.

I wouldn't come back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2017-02-16,Very authentic Chinese Resturant. Try 309 (Sichuan-style Chilli Chicken).
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2017-07-01,"Below average service quality, food is ok. The waiter was rude; we were always ignored thus decided not to tip generously, he gave us the eye and complained rudely."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-01-18,"I've been to a number of Chinese restaurants in Berlin but this one is a real deal. I was so happy to find an authentic, yummy Sichuan Chinese place in this city. I read some people had problems with a rude male server there. My server was a female and she was friendly. Please don't get discouraged by a potential rude server. The food is worth a visit."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-01-24,"The best seafood soup I've ever had. Simple, yet so perfect. I don't remember the actual name but you can't miss it. The Shrimp is delicious! Really authentic. Definitely going back in a few days."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-12-29,"Honestly rating one star is overrating for tian-fu restaurant. Food, environment is ""ok"" in this place but overall not as good as the reviews. HOWEVER the service attitude towards to customers is ill-mannered especially the middle-aged waiter. The wait time was more than 30 minutes and this rude waiter said its normal to wait such a long time for dinning like its the customers problem.
I also noticed that other customers came in without reservation were treated inpatient.
I would not consider to have Asian food in this place any more."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-05-11,Who knew I would find one of my favorite Chinese restaurants ever in Berlin. And I don't even like Chinese food. Have spent a lot of time in China as well. Thanks guys.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2015-03-05,"I went here with some friends who highly recommended this restaurant. It is pretty authentic in Chinese cuisine but I didn't particularly love it. We ordered a bunch of dumplings and dim sum items. They were all pretty good, just not amazing in my opinion. I would try it again but definitely try some others out first before I go back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-07-12,"great chinese restaurant! With quite a nice selection of meals, not only the classic ones!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-01-25,"Word of the day is BANGING BUFFET. This place got a pretty good buffet if you ask me, take my word or dont you foolios. The staff and waiters are deaf and blind so dont expect anything from them. Its all about the food. Xie xie means thanks you in chinese so dont forget to use that one, it all ways works. Trust me. Peace"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-03-24,"As far as I know this is the only good Chinese restaurant in Berlin, and it's actually as good as anything I""ve had back in San Francisco, New York, or Houston.

Once Berlin gets a decent cal-mex or tex-mex restaurant I'll never have to leave the city again for good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-10-22,Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin..  Try the spicy chicken (#309).  It's borderline too hot for me but the taste on the chicken and veggies is amazing.  We eat from here a couple times per month.  May need reservations for evenings.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2013-01-28,"By far the best restaurant for Sichuan food in Berlin! Couldn't find anything like this outside of China ;-)
Top!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2013-11-28,"It gets five stars for being the most authentic northern Chinese cuisine I've had in Berlin (I used to live in Beijing); malheureusement the prices reflect that.

Do you want ?????, ????,  ????????, ??.... ?? It's all here and it's all very, very tasty, ????, you won't regret it."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-02-11,Excellent chinese food! I can absolutely recommend this restaurant! Service is not too friendly but still polite. Unfortunately this restaurant does not accept credit cards.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2011-06-27,"I quite enjoyed this restaurant.  Unlike a few others in the street (on a Saturday afternoon), this one actually had clientele. 

I indulged in a number of vegetarian options - dim sum, aubergine, mixed veg, and a water spinach dish.  All good - the aubergine being the highlight.  

Friendly service, quiet, and good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2011-05-24,"If you order a main course marked with 3 chilis in Tian-Fu, it really is uncompromisingly hot. Authentic Schezuan food, I must say.


 However, consistency seems to be an issue. Also the service of the male waiter was lacking."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2010-01-03,"So far, I found this place to be an adequate Sichuan restaurant. Atmosphere is nice, service is friendly and good, and the food is not too bad, although I haven't tried too many dishes. The good news is that the dimsum is actually homemade, the bad news is that it isn't that great but full marks for trying. The roast duck was passable, the fried rice was quite good and a couple of other dishes were tolerable.


 I will be back again as the hotpot looks quite interesting and so do some of the more traditional Sichuan dishes. The only comparable Sichuan restaurant in Berlin is the original Ming Dynasty in Br?ckenstra?e 6 and they are both pretty much neck-and-neck, though Ming is perhaps a little cheaper.


 Oh, the other good news is that I did not detect much use of monosodium glutamate in Tian Fu, so that is definitely a plus point.


 NOTE: I did come by again for the Sichuan hotpot and it was pretty good. Still, I think the Lucky Star in Friedrichstrasse does a slightly better hotpot with a tastier soup. Just my opinion!"
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2010-10-26,"So, after wandering about the Soviet-inspired city-planning horror that is Karl Marx Allee, I was hungry and needed a good meal... and on a cold and rainy Saturday, with the streets almost empty, I ventured into this welcoming spot.

Unexpectedly, a menu in English appeared, the owner was more than accommodating in getting me a glass of water (with ICE!) they he didn't bill me for! The build out is top notch - comfortable and decorous, without being schmaltzy like some asian places.

I ordered a sublime sweet and sour chicken - a meal that was simply perfect in so many ways.... and, honestly, a portion I should hav shared with someone else, but greedily ate most of it. Nice touch: The plate is served on a small pedestal that holds a candle to keep it warm as you dine. It looks great and actually works.

For many cities, this place would probably get 4 stars, but here in Berlin - they get 5 for the extras."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-05-24,"First off, loved all the fish tanks that this restaurant had. The food was very good and filling. The portion sizes were really good for the price. I went with some friends so we were able to pick and choose a ton of dishes and split everything. Worked out to be a high quality dinner that also gave each of us a variety of food."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-05-23,Nice restaurant. Good service nice portions of food would  definitely go there again. Best chinese i have had in berlin
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-07-03,"In a word - best dim sum I have ever had in my life, even better than in China!

Longer version (for the brave) - hands down, best dim sum I've had so far.

We've arrived here for dinner before it got really crowded, so if you plan on coming here after 20:00- reserve a table, the place is pretty small.

Once we've opened the menu we were thinking ""ok, so what do we not order?!""
As my friend is vegetarian, we had about 9 options to choose from if you exclude the ones with chicken/pork/seafood.
Which is quite a lot! 

So we've settled on four, all vegetarian.
The one who took our order asked if we're vegan or vegetarian, we said no but didn't really understood why - until he put complimentary prawn crackers on the table, super nice and highly considerate! 

For a starter we had a soup that was kind of tasteless until we added some soy into it, but as the dim sum arrived we forget about it.

9 - kakao traum, absolute best! If we weren't full after all the food we'd totally order one more round of those, perfect flavor, perfect serving.

The others we've taken were also really good, but this was really something else.
From our point of view this is a place you can't really go wrong.
There's no good and bad, just tasty and tastier!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,3,2016-03-02,"Hmmm apart from the very cute utensils and the super cute dessert baozi (one with chocolate in panda shape and one with strawberry jam in piggy shape) the other dimsums are average at best.

Ha gaw and dumpling are most likely frozen ones from the supermarket with super thick wrappings. The filling is tasty but the wrap just kills the merit of the filling. XLB is very disappointing :("
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,2017-05-25,"My first experience with Dim Sum. I can't vouch for authenticity, but it was definitely delicious.
Go early or reserve ahead. Space is limited"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,2,2016-05-02,"Worst dim sum ever.. Yes.. I got suckered in as I saw the miss piggy dessert pictures on other reviews. The miss piggy dessert was nothing but bread with artificial strawberry jam in it. The rest of the dim sum was subpar compared to any other authentic Chinese venue. I ordered the typical dishes shi jin bao, cha shao bao, dumplings with vegetables, glass noodles, and carrots, and xiao long bao. It just didn't taste fresh at all. 
Our server was nice and attentive. She gets 2 star for that. End of story. I don't know how this place has so many stars."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-07-10,"Tried it out if curiosity. I got a salad (cucumber) and  dumplings. I loved both. They have so many kinds of dumplings. I tried a couple and have fallen in love with this place. Situated in a charming street , I think the only restaurant I'm this side of the Street, this place has a lot to offer. Definitely worth checking out."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-10-26,"I wanted to try this place for some tjme and finally made it! Wonderful place for dumplings! Cheap, tasty, fast and a great service! It's a small cute shop in a nice area, the tea is super special. The menu is small but I find it a good thing. Their specialty is the dim sum. They have also quite a few options for vegetarians and vegans. Absolutely love it."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,1,2016-07-30,"The 3 color(dish no. F4 Sanse) is the one I like the most! Good service, nice stuff but the food taste not surprising, not really recommend... I feel sorry"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-05-15,"Oh my goodness - AMAZING DUMPLING AND GREAT SERVICE!

Came her around 5 a couple days ago expecting to wait for a table (based on the other yelp reviews) but we were quickly seated and given cushions and a nice table spread to make sitting outside more comfortable. The waiter and waitress were very sweet and attentive and our food came out in a timely manner! The prawn crackers they serve before your meal are delightful. 

The dumplings were delicious and ask for the sweet chili sauce! It's really nice with the shrimp dumplings. The green tea is served in a nice porcelain detailed painted tea pot with adorable little cups. 

And every dumpling plate is ?4.90... What could be better!

Wasn't a huge fan of the dessert chocolate bear dumplings but it was good to try. Can't wait to go back!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-06-15,"so, SO good. amazing prices (we drank and ate until we were stuffed, for under 25 euros). small restaurant and cash only as far as i can tell, but i would come here every day if i could. most importantly, EXCEPTIONAL service (which is a rare find)."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,2016-09-22,Very nice place to eat for cheap! Service was mediocre.
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-06-03,"I've always been a fan of dim sum. It's like heaven in your mouth. So when an opportunity presented itself to go to this place, I immediately took it. A companion was visiting town, so when we needed to have dinner, I suggested this place and made a reservation.

They don't have an extensive menu. They have two soup types, a handful of cold salads and other appetizers, about 5 vegetarian dim sum, and about 8 meat-filled dim sum. But that was enough to bring heaven to the inside of my mouth. 

My companion and I each ordered a soup, and I tried the wantan soup, which was delicate in its flavor and presentation. The wantans were floating in warm soupy bliss. It had just the right taste, and was meant more to enjoy and savor, than to simply slurp.

Then my companion and I ordered three different dim sum to share. With perhaps the most expensive order still being under 5 EUR, this wasn't an expensive meal. Each order have 5 pieces of dim sum, presented inside a steamer, and yes, they provide wooden non-disposable chopsticks. They also ask you what kind of sauce you want, as they have several choices at your disposal. 

Oh, the shao mai, and the shrimp-filled steamed mini buns, they were all heaven in my mouth. Next time, I'd go down the menu and try the other items.

I'll definitely be back. This is a great find, and is something that will be on the top of my list for a while. Reservations are recommended, as they are a very small place, with only a few tables inside."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,2015-09-20,"I love dim sum- it's my absolute favorite. This place was absolutely delicious, and they have some very unusual kinds. They have an entire selection of vegan/vegetarian dumplings, really adorable dessert buns, and unusual and flavorful sides.

The place is pretty small, but it has a nice homey atmosphere.  I'd recommend arriving before the peak dinner hours, or making a reservation. However, if they don't have any open tables, they also take your number and give you a call when one opens up, so you can explore the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in the meantime."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,1,2015-11-10,"Edit May 2017: 2 years ago I visited the place and rated it with 5 stars.
Today I'm giving it just one star because the dumplings taste like supermarket frozen ones.
I expected fresh dumplings that are not teaming with preservatifs but there you go. Not gonna find that here."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-06-08,"Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it was still really good. The price was fair and the waitress was really sweet and on the ball. The other woman working there was also really nice as well. Definitely coming back."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-01-11,"So so so good. Loved the wonton soup and the rice wrapper pork dumplings! The perfect place for a quiet, low-key, delicious meal."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-01-23,"We already ate at Lecker Song a lot of times since this little restaurant with just a few tables opened . 
It's always very good, always very fresh. Everything is homemade, original and tasty.
You're always warmly welcome, both the owner and the staff are very friendly.
A good place, to recommend."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,3,2016-07-02,"This is a cozy cute place. Offers mostly a small portion with about 4 tiny one bite size (no bigger than McNugget size) dumplings costs 4.5-5 Euro average/per plate. I would not consider this to be exactly cheap. If you are hungry and sharing, you would probably want to order about 3-4 plates each person. I do not have a size of cow stomach and I am a tiny woman. Do the math. Should not be listed as ?. More like ??? for what it is."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-11-07,Amazing dumplings and friendly service. This is the best dim sum I've had in Berlin. Their tea selection is also amazing.
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-09-30,Amazing place to experience authentic chinese dumplings while also being able to eat fully vegan if you want to! Everything vegan on the menu is deliciou and the staff is really nice!
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under ?10,4,2014-11-24,This little and tiny restaurant is hidden just behind Helmholtzplatz. The first time I tried to find it I almost passed it. Once you enter you are being welcomed by the friendly owner who offers you one of the very few buy cozy tables. They have various dumplings with many different fillings and tastes. I always just order a few and then more along the way. In that way you can spend a good and relaxed time with friends here. Food tastes solid but there is still a bit  room for improvement. It's pretty pricey as well but overall better than all the places along Kantstrasse. Certainly worth a try. But rather don't come in large groups.
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2017-10-22,"Hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area that are willing to make the food as spicy as we would like it to be. 

The owner was quick to help us order the correct amount of spice and the woman cooking in the back was responsive to the spice level. Normally, Germans do not like much spice in their food. Rest assured if you ask for spicy food, you will get it. 

Really enjoyed the variety of food available. 4 different items, 3 drinks for 50? is a good meal. We will be back!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2017-10-11,"Best Chinese food I've ever had! No English menus but the waitress was beyond helpful. I actually ate here on my one night alone while my husband was at a work conference, and enjoyed every bite of my solo dining experience!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2017-07-01,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant by far. Their food is excellent - I have never had a dish I didn't like - and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you happen to be in the area around lunch time, try one of their soups (with fresh, homemade noodles!). The dishes can get quite spicy, but you can always ask beforehand if you're not sure."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-04-18,"This place is perfectly authentic! It's a small tidy restaurant, the dishes are so delicious and the price is reasonable. You can ask for recommendations and you won't be disappointed!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-09-17,"I haven't been to China, but this is what I picture as more of (from what I've seen on TV and from how friends describe it) as more authentic Chinese cuisine. Small place, very quaint but nice. My wife and brother in law had a chicken dish with green veggies (mostly onions and Lima beans, IIRC). It was very light in flavor, but in a good way. They both really liked it. I had a hot broth dish with some really great chili spices, beef, potatoes, and veggies. It had some real kick to it, but was pretty great. They served a family pot of white rice to eat everything with. Ended up being a little over ?10 per person I think. We will definitely be back here to try more dishes, strongly recommend."
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-11-19,"An almost unrecognizable ""hole-in-the-wall"" restaurant, yet serves the most authentic Chinese food in Berlin with dishes from many regions in China including Ningxia.

Try the Grilled Lamb Skewers, the noodle soups, and the Szechuan Beef"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,3,2016-06-26,"Tasty and affordable, though they don't seem to be doing the tabletop bbq anymore, even though it's still on the menu (or maybe that was a temporary thing?). 

Lots of more authentic dishes to separate the menu from the traditional panAsian stir fries made for German palettes. Would definitely recommend the northern Chinese dishes. Skip the dumplings though.

Inside of the restaurant is a little plain. Can be stuffy on hot days. Nice service though."
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-03-29,"This is the first place I've eaten at in Berlin that reminds me of the food back home. I am from San Gabriel Valley in the Los Angeles area where it is easy to find authentic Chinese food so I can say I know my Asian food really well. All the flavors are there. They make their food fresh everyday. The owners and servers are very nice and friendly. And if you want to try something unique, I strongly recommend their red wine pear dish which is cool, crisp, and sweet. They also hand make their noodles and have different dumpling skins that gets its color from vegetable juice. Try this place!"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-07-13,"Nice dishes, nice services, the dumplings and noodles are very delicious and really 'chinese style'."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-02-06,"My favorite meal in Berlin! Very affordable, and very tasty. 

Kind staff, quick service, lovely atmosphere.

Entrees: #52, crispy duck, is to die for. 
veggie/vegan: many options, my friend got fried tofu with noodles and said it was great

Appetizers: fried wontons are AMAZING (not huge portions, so if you're hungry get a few...they're only a few euros). The vegetarian spring rolls are also great."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,2017-02-04,Nothing was tasty. The lime chicken was inedible; the meat felt like it's been boiled dry. The gado gado wasn't a gado gado; there was frozen boiled carrots and peas in it.. . Everything tastes like cheap sauces from the Asia shelf at the supermarket. Nothing is fresh.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2015-07-30,"Such a pleasant surprise last sunday dinner

I honestly didn't have so many expectations looking at the price of the food which is relative cheap, but the dishes were simply well done, good quantity, delicious taste and pretty good varieties of choices

I took a chicken dish with Sumatra sauce with peppers, my friend took the duck. The chicken was well cooked the spicy was balanced the coconut sauce was not covering everything like sometimes happens with this kitchen type; the duck crispy and the side dish was made up of vegetables and a little sweet sauce

I think the fortune of this place at the moment is the a capable chef. You could cut the chicken with the fork

The place inside is nice; there is also a more elevate space for a couple of tables in the end of the room

I'm sure I will be back here

UPDATE 19/09/2015
Since I recently found this place I've been here 3 times (please don't go to imbiss so frequently!), trying different dishes, always with an excellent service"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,2017-08-10,"This place used to be so good. Now the service is very poor, and the dishes bad quality. I used to come here all the time, but now I find there are much better places in this area. i have a pet peeve for restaurants living off of ""former glory"" and getting worse in service and quality.sadness."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2016-06-12,"Very good value! Cheap price and tasty food. Cozy restaurant, veeeery friendly waiters! The two of us ordered the snack plate as a starter, the black dragon and 4 small bowls (spicy fish, Sumatra tofu, rice and mango salad) as a main. Everything was delicious (especially the snack plate, sumatra tofu and black dragon). Good portion size! 
Will be back for sure :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-11-21,"Absolutely loved this place. First off, we were sat right away, which is a good start. We did come on a Saturday, and it was fairly busy. I love that you have the option of ordering smaller, sample sized portions. It gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes if you can't decide on what you want. We decided to start with Gado Gado, and (two) fried pork dumplings. This was my first time trying Gado Gado, and though I am not usually a fan of tofu, I really enjoyed it! And for only 3 Euros, it was definitely worth it. The dumplings were also great. I liked that they were pan friend, rather than deep fried. For mains, we ordered the Peanut Duck and the Lime Chicken. Both were delicious. Good presentation as well. My one complaint would be that the duck was slightly overcooked, which made it a bit chewy.  

Overall, the food was very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I am excited to go back, and next time, try a couple more dishes out."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2013-07-09,"Given the name of this restaurant, I am sure that plenty of people have come here to have a juvenile moment. Anyway, my companion and I tried this one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all, I have this idea that as Berlin has plenty of Asian restaurants, it cannot be the case that all of them are good. So perhaps there are more bad restaurants than good ones. This is coming from someone who is still surprised to see Thai and Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine in one roof.

Anyway, like I said, our food was rather good. And given the price, I expected something bare-bones, but what we got were rather swanky. I ordered the Sumatra duck, and it was said to be rather spicy. Beware of the red chilli peppers; they really are hot. My companion ordered the spicy duck, which was more a hot and sour sauce. Both came with rice. And we washed it both with iced ginger tea. 

Overall, I think it was a good choice. I'd be more than willing to go back here again when I have the chance."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-06-15,Ordered the normal chicken nudles and the duck with black pepper sauce&rice and couldn't decide which one was better. Also the service was great!
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,1,2016-06-24,"This place is terrible. Why did I believe the yelp reviews? The food is not fresh nor good quality and is masked in pre-mixed sauces, over fried in old oil and served in small cheap portions - reflecting the quality. The chicken looked as though it was breed on hormones and pumped with water and starch. I don't usually bother to write bad reviews but I feel stupid for going here and want to warn others against it. Tourist trap. Bad."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-10-07,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!

Best food, friendliest stuff, beautiful atmosphere, fair prices...always.

Try the chicken satay, the chicken wings, black dragon, the mango salad or peanut tofu... all at once! (there is an option to try several dishes in smaller bowls instead of only ordering one big one) 

Anyway, enjoy! :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,3,2014-11-02,"Aside from the creepy, questionably non-PC name, this place was aight. I like that in the menu, they specify what is in all of the sauces they use, since usually in an Indonesian or similar restaurant, I am not too familiar with the types of sauces they have. Other than that, I didn't think this restaurant offered anything too unique. The food was just ok and will do if you are craving Indonesian food. Service was again, just ok. The atmosphere was comfortable, but I honestly am not that convinced to come back again."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-02-06,"Amazing, this place was so cute and so good.Service was great and the courses were large. Note-if you take a rice table which is cool because you can share, the plates are really small..so if you are on a budget go for the bigger plates.. Would really recommend for a nice night out with good food..Have been there twice and I really think you can't go wrong...Delish!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-01-01,"Service & Atmosphere: Very friendly and prompt service. I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don't have to wait long for food

Food: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! 

Drinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.

Price: I don't know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each? Which is great if you want to try a lot of things and works out to be a similar price as a main!

In short: Definitely recommend this place!!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-02-22,A great find on a rainy night. Delicious food with authentic flavours for the right price. Very friendly and quick service.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,2,2014-11-30,"Average, didn't know how it deserved the 4.5 stars. We all ordered different dishes with entr?e and from five people had no positive feedback. Give it a miss"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2015-01-17,We tried the vegetarian food and it was really good. I had the tastiest Tofus ever and I will definitely come again.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2014-07-23,"The food here was completely delicious, we were able to share a few small options between 3 of us, very tasty. The drinks are reasonably prices, and the atmosphere and service was very good!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2014-04-13,We really liked this place. The atmosphere was great. The waiter very friendly. The prices were good and the appetizers out of this world.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2010-08-12,Good Indonesian food here. I tried the rijsttafel (rice table) and it was very good. Lots choices to mix and match with just the right amount of spice. Prices are very reasonable to boot.
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-10-28,"A vegetarian / vegan Chinese restaurant? What a cool idea. And very well worked out in this case. The food is good to excellent, the decoration is very nice and the service was great, with a young waiter doing an excellent job. You could see that he was loved by the regulars. 

Our favourite dish was the cauliflower, but the rest was also very nice.

Conclusion: Please open a location in Friedrichshain so we can come often!"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-02-15,"Good!! Nice interior and food. I go very often even its quite far from my place. They have menu ""suan la tang ???"", its good who loves hot spicy food but time to time its bad... ask for more spicy ver. If u  wanna try gooood suan la tang."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-02-09,"We were lazy last night, so instead of cooking, we opted to find some place near our neighborhood to eat. We stumbled upon this place, even though we were walking on our way to some other location, which, perhaps fortunately, had no place for us. So we walked into this one, asked if they had a free table, and voila, we were seated within minutes.

This restaurant is affiliated with the restaurant in our own neighborhood, Tian Fu, and since we knew that was a good choice, I had high hopes for this one. After all, this is quite adventurous: vegetarian and Szechuan. 

Given that there was a vegetarian constraint in this restaurant, I was impressed with the tasty selections they had. There was a section of the menu where they had alternatives: fake duck, fake meat, and so forth, but even if you don't go there, there are plenty of interesting items one can order. 

I simply loved the eggplant Yiuxiang-style. We also ordered a bunch of other appetizers (we're those snobby types that think that appetizers are more interesting than main dishes), and since there were quite a bit of eggplant, we opted to take the remainder home.

I am withholding a star for logistic reasons: there is a section of the restaurant that can only be reached by climbing the stairs. While we were there, someone tripped, and almost crashed on to another table. It would have been great if they installed handrails, or at least made the steps a little bit more visible. The current paint job of very creamy beige doesn't make it too obvious, and people might miscalculate their steps.

Otherwise, this place is great. I'll definitely be back."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-03-07,"What a fantastic restaurant. Great service, the food just out of this world. We got treated by the charming owner to a plateful of vegan calamari. OMG! Just amazing. This place is a must try for all you vegetarians/ vegans and spicy food lovers."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,?11-20,5,2016-11-02,"Dear Tianfuzius, Please come to Prenzlauer Berg! We trekked all the way from Prenzlauer Berg to eat here, and boy were we glad we did! We had Xiao Long Bao (Chinese steamed buns), Gebackene Wan Tan mit einer s??-sauren Sauce (fried Wan Tans with sweet and sour sauce), Tofutopf nach Sichuan-Art (Spicy Sichuan Tofu Stew) and Vegetarisches Gongbao Huhn mit Erdn?ssen (Vegetarian Gungbao\Kung Po Chicken with peanuts) - every item was delicious to outstanding! My non-vegetarian friend loved the dim sum more than anything and I savoured every interestingly different tasting bite of the tofu stew that left my taste buds in awe! The dim sum portions were small but the entrees were big, especially the stew! The service was nice and the restaurant interiors were lovely. Prices are fair for the quality of the food, portion sizes and location. I highly recommend it!"
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,5,2016-10-27,"Very inexpensive + fresh and flavorful = five stars.

Found this place walking through Alexanderplatz. Menu and prices looked good, so we gave it a shot. So glad we did! Prices are ?5-?8 for carry out to dine in, the portions are sizeable (we were hungry after a day of walking!) and the food is cooked fresh and fast while you wait. Great sauces, crisp veggies, nicely cooked meats. For this price you can't do better."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under ?10,4,2016-04-27,"Look, let me start by saying that, despite more good places popping up as of late, it can be really hard to find good Thai/Chinese/Eastern Asian type food, so it's all relative. So I am rating this place not on a grand scale of Asian food in Berlin, or even compared to the stuff I miss from the US, but relative to other Asian and specifically fast food places in Berlin.

As far as quick eats Asian places, this is about as good as you'll find. ?4.50 will get you a box with lots of rice, veggies, and chicken (?1 more for duck) and your choice of decent sauces. After trying every other place around there this is the only place in this category that I have ever come back too, and now I come two or three times a week. Generally, avoid Alexanderplatz as all of the food around is garbage, but if you are there all of the time (I work one tram stop away, and food is worse by my office) and need a decent quick meal, this place is pretty solid."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-12-31,"For Chinese Food in Berlin on New Years Eve, without reservations, this was a solid choice.  Service was fast, the menu was extensive, and the dishes I ordered were perfect.  It's a large ""hall"" style Chinese restaurant, with a lot of tables, and a few smaller seating areas built inside, but it wasn't too noisy, and didn't feel cramped at all.

I'd definitely go back if I wanted Chinese food and were in Mitte."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-08-04,"I am not really a Chinese enthusiast, but the food, service, and location is good. I ordered the mini vegetable egg rolls, fried noodles with chicken, fried noodles with beef, chicken, and another meat that I can't remember, and fried rice.  I would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-06-04,"The most authentic Chinese restaurant I found so far in Berlin, should not be missed for ones looking for real Chinese foods but western Asian."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2015-05-19,"As a suggestion from one of my co-workers in Berlin, I ate here with my boss during a business trip to Berlin for dinner.  What a great choice!

The service was fast, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was okay.  Plus it was in walking distance from the Courtyard Marriott where we were staying.

Another place on my list when staying in Berlin."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2015-03-27,"Lots of options but the quality isn't that great. The staff is helpful. I do like the ambience. Spacious. I got the fried noodles with chicken, beef and vegetables. It was a bit too oily and not all that flavourful. For what you pay you can get better portions elsewhere."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-03-15,Too much MSG and the green peppers tasted moldy. might have been my taste buds so I give three stars. overall quite generic.
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2014-06-15,"Avoid at all costs if you don't to be treated as an intrusion rather than paying customer. I usually trust Yelp reviews because I know the reviewers care about great food as much as I do but this time I totally disagree with previous reviewers.

We chose this restaurant due to its closeness to our hotel rather than one with better reviews a distance away.  From the minute we entered I have never encountered such disdain, rudeness and lack of interest on behalf of the restaurant staff.  After 10 minutes after seating we still had not been greeted at table even though only 3 tables filled in restaurant.  Eventually got attention of waiter and the evening went down after.  His attitude was downright hostile - could it have been because we spoke English and not German? We were  a diverse group with Malaysia, Indonesia, Indian and US represented out to have a nice business dinner.

Now the food- pan fried dumplings okay, soups poor. Mains- crispy duck in Szechuan sauce & prawns in paprika-pepper both 3.5 stars.  Fried fish filet with mushrooms - no flavor & no fish!  Sweet & sour pork - 2 stars.

Decor- dated tacky Chinese decor with abundance of dirty/dusty fake flowers everywhere.

All in all- would have give 3 star but cannot tolerate or accept such rude and indifferent wait staff."
China City,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2013-01-24,Very good Chinese restaurant! Cook very fast and delicious! There is always a lot of visitors ... Very often it eat and enjoy!

YUMMIE"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2017-07-26,"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Food is great, spicy but acceptable because of the quality and the freshness of the food. Lots of Chinese restaurant is using glutamates to cover and give the impression of Chinese food. Here none, it's just well prepared with delicious and fresh vegetables. We loved it really!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-06-08,"Really good Chinese food! Had spicy chicken with pineapple, carrots and peppers. It was really solid. Nice interior, very clean and modern, white tablecloth kinda place. Very nice service and a menu in English. Much appreciated!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-10-01,"Been here twice. Great Chinese food! The chicken was tender and fresh and the veggies were perfect. Friendly, fast service as well. Nice quiet neighborhood to walk around in as well. Will definitely come back for the dim sum which looked delicious."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2014-09-11,"Not bad, it's exactly Chinese style. The boss is from Zhejiang, the soup is good, home style."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,5,2011-10-18,"Great authentic Chinese food at reasonable price. The location is great although it might have been a little cosier if the lighting would have been a little bit darker.
I tried a very spicy chicken, believing it would be Sichuan spicy. This was not the case. The chicken was great but not as spicy as expected.
I would easily recommend this place!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,?11-20,4,2011-01-29,At the moment this is one of my favourite chinese restaurant in Berlin. The food is delicious!
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2017-12-29,"Very friendly owner and authentic Chinese cuisine.
A cozy, family-style late night restaurant after opera."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-04-03,"In general, the food tastes fine, not really impressive but fair. If you want to have ""all you can eat"" hot pot, this place actually I feel much better than another one called Lucky Star which is also located in Berlin near U bahn station- Oranienburger Tor. With similar prices, here there are much more choices, I was surprised that they even offer scampi and mussel! Also more vegetables and the most important things is their stuff is much nicer than another. Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2014-05-13,Can be a Good choice for the chinese cuisine lovers. I ate a kind of noodle and it was OK. Good location and reasonable price by the way.
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2011-05-24,"To order their speciality-Hot Pot- is experience and food is good.Interier is not charming and service is slowest I ever experienced( for example when fire at HotPot dies and you would like to call service to make it work again...or even order one more drink) ,but otherwise still nice people and dog friendly place."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,4,2011-10-14,"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Cosy, authentic chinese decor and music.  Very large variety of dishes on the menu, but limited beverage list.  Definitely going back!  Would highly recommend when you are craving some high quality chinese food!"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under ?10,5,2017-05-24,"This food is delicious! Never heard of such a place before, but was simply walking by as I had to wait an hour for my appointment at the Zullasungstelle down the street. Walked in, met a very friendly staff that recommended me the Beef dumplings, and I also ordered the pumpkin/pea dumplings. I'm literally just through the pumpkin/pea dumplings right now and realized I had to write in Yelp asap about these guys. 

In the picture is the beef dumplings only (b9 on the menu I believe) as I was starving and chomped on the pumpkin/pea set immediately. Highly recommended and I'll be back here even without an appointment at the Zulassungstelle! :-)"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under ?10,4,2017-08-27,"Set in a beautiful part of the Kreuzberg area called Bergmannkiez, this neighborhood eatery provides delicious dumplings and relaxing atmosphere. Whether you decide to sit outside on the street and watch the passers by or inside, you'll surely enjoy anyone of Cha for Tee's broad menu of meat-filled and vegetarian dumplings.

I went with an appetizer of pork wanton soup, which really hit the spot. Later, I hit the pork dumplings with cabbage and coriander. It was quite good--not the best dumplings I've ever had--but definitely satisfying enough and well worth the price.

But the real piece de resistance of the joint is the desert. I got the pastry dumplings (set of two) which came I are with coffee out on the street-side tables.

All and all, it was a perfect way to spend a late Sunday afternoon."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under ?10,4,2017-10-17,"The place is in a very cute area~there are many different kinds of dumplings here, and they are colorful! Good dumplings!"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under ?10,3,2017-07-26,"If you are craving dumplings or some semblance of Chinese food, this place is fine. They have a homemade chili oil sauce that I liked. The dan dan mian was tasty, but it lacked the boldness that I am used to. Xiao long bao was a disappointment --flavor was decent, but most of my soup dumplings didn't have soup. Ma la ro was acceptable.

If this is your only option for Chinese, you'll be fine. Good service, nice ambiance and plenty of seating on a quiet street near templehof. It was a very pleasant experience nonetheless. CASH ONLY."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under ?10,5,2016-11-07,"This place is so cute. And super tasty. We tried the green bean appetizer and several of the vegetarian and pork dumplings. All are highly recommended- especially the green beans. The tea selection was crazy. The only draw-back was that the dumplings take a while to steam. We ordered another round after our first and then one more for dessert and ended up staying quite a while, even for European standards. But the atmosphere is nice so no real complaints here!"
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2015-07-24,"Great food! Really nice staff, the waitress gave my boyfriend and I free fortified wine at the end.

One thing- yelp says it is 4 euro signs when it is SO CHEAP! Like, 5 euros for an entree and a side cheap. Please change this yelp!"
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2015-07-24,"This is the place for good Chinese food at low prices. They even gave us the lunch special price at dinnertime, and complimentary after-dinner drinks. Knocked my socks off. I would say to you: go for it. Go. Tasty stuff."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-06-12,"In a word - a great place which offers a lot of options from all over Asia, with some traditional Tibetan dishes.

Longer version (for the brave) - we arrived to this place after literally trying every option of Asian food there is, besides Tibetan. It was time.

So we sat outside as the weather was nice and ordered vegetarian starters (Tsa pakora and veggie fried pockets).
Watch out, as it is served HOT! got a burn from the spinach :) 
But it was delicious, and quite a big dish for a starter, each of them came with two dips too. 
I loved the Tsa pakora, it was crispy and had great flavors. 

For the main dish I had a traditional Tibetan dish, sorry but I forgot its name... Seasoned rice with veggies and beef with some cashews on top and an interesting curry sauce, it tastes a bit different than other curries I have tried before and it's not too spicy for those of you who can't handle it, no worries :)

My friend had fried momos with cheese and spinach, I'd like to try them next time but with some meat inside, got a feeling it would taste much much better! 

The dishes are very big, I was kinda full half way through but it was so good I kept digging in it almost until I finished it all!

Service was great and we had a great experience, the prices are really good and overall we just had great fun, no doubt I'll come again soon! 
All the reviews here really justify everything about this place, hopefully mine does too :)"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2016-09-26,"There probably aren't many cuisines you can't find in Berlin, but I was still surprised to see a Tibetan restaurant. Warm and cozy, decorated with candles and photos of Tibet, Little Tibet serves staples such as momos (dumplings), noodle soups, rice dishes, and a few wok-fried meats. 

Torn between the shaptak shoko (stir-fried beef, veggies, and potato) and a mixed momo dish, the momos won out. Six steamed and six fried dumplings (three each of minced beef & ginger/spinach & cheese) served with a light salad in a yogurt dressing and a sweet chili based dipping sauce. The momos were surprisingly light but did not skimp on the filling.

 It made for a satisfying (and, at ?8, quite cheap) meal."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-05-10,Very tasty!  I had a veggie dish off the house specialty page and it was great!  Service was very friendly and attentive too. She also spoke English in case you don't speak German.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2017-06-01,"Extremely pleased! Great food, friendly service, really happy customer. Did I say great food? Really great food!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-04-18,"A companion of mine suggested that we head here for dinner before heading to the theatre yesterday. She was positively impressed before and since I haven't been to a Tibetan restaurant in a long time I opted to go here as well. 

We ordered the spinach fritters for an appetizer, and I followed that with the mixed momos for a main dish. The spinach fritters were good, paired well with the sauce they had, and the mixed momos I had were also very tasty. I thought that the momos would be too bready, but actually they were more filling than bread, which was a plus. 

We also ordered the mango lassi.

It seems that this place is popular; we came there around 6:30 PM on a Saturday and we got tables, but there were plenty of other tables that were reserved, and an hour later when we were leaving, there were already plenty of tables that were occupied. Make a reservation if you want to eat later."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-08-11,Awful service but delicious food. Really great ginger tea with actual ginger in it. Delicious :)
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,3,2016-04-22,Not really authentic Tibetan food but nontheless it was tasty and the dishes came quickly.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-03-21,Relaxing joint with plenty of space and lots of options. If you're getting momos then prepare to wait awhile because they take time to prepare. We got the spring rolls which I wasn't too fond of but the vegetarian momos and beef momos were fantastic. Will definitely consider coming back.
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2015-02-14,"It was a surprise place for us. We've seen it from outside and went in because I love Tibetan Buddhists. It's quite spiritual inside. A White Tara shrine welcomes you, there is photographs from Tibet and words and pics of Dalai Lama on walls. It's the first time I see Buddha in some place as more than plain decoration.

Surprise part was the food. We started with some Tibetan pastry and salad, continue with large plate of mixed dumplings and duck with red curry. If we didn't had trouble breathing with all those foods we could go on until morning. All of them were great.

Staff is super friendly, atmosphere is peaceful. And don't worry even though a Buddhist place there is lots of meat and alcohol =)"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2014-05-16,The food was really good and the staff was very friendly. The prices were low for the quality of the food!
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2015-07-03,"Good food and prices. A little oily. Had the beef and onion dumplings and a chicken fried rice with cashews and a delicious orange sauce, which was apparently a monks' recipe. My favorite was the potato pancake appetizer. The food was very good, but I couldn't finish, as it was very rich. Cheap vino"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2013-11-17,"So they could do something better with the lighting inside but the food was great!
They have a nice but not too big variety of dishes and delicious appetizers.
I'll go again and can recommend it!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,5,2012-03-02,Super lecker!!! Geh mal wieder!
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2012-05-09,"Of the cluster of Himalayan-themed restaurants around Western Kreuzberg, Little Tibet is both the best and, apparently, the only one run by actual Tibetans. For the first indication of their authenticity, be sure to order the Butter Tea, a frothy, salty, buttery traditional brew that is somewhere between a beverage and a soup on the western palate.
Tibetan food is not known for its showiness or intense flavors, but it is ideally suited for a cold winter night, and the dishes here are reliably hearty and satisfying. The standout, of course, is Momos, housemade Tibetan dumplings (steamed or fried) which are easily the best in town. A combination platter is great value and a meal unto itself, although a dipping sauce other than the default sweet-chili condiment would be an improvement. 
Meat and vegetable dishes here don't veer far from the path trod by many of Berlin's Asian restaurants, with Tibetan specialties fighting for attention with more Thai and Indian-influenced fare. There's nothing wrong with the fried duck or coconut soups, but they do rather dilute the concept. Still, they're a notch above nearby competitors; nothing comes off as greasy, and the vegetables are uniformly fresh and tasty.
Service is also reliably friendly and fast, and the very cheap wine list makes it very easy to have a nice evening out here for under EUR20 p/p."
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,4,2011-06-13,"I'd never eaten Tibetan food before, so I don't know if it was authentic, but it was delicious. I got the selection of momos, and enjoyed all the flavors. The spinach pakoras were great, as were the sauces that came with them!"
Little Tibet,Indian,4.5,?11-20,3,2010-11-07,"I was excited to eat at a Tibetan restaurant, and much of the food itself did not disappoint. The restaurant was full on a Friday night, which is always a good sign, and the ambience was lovely, including the charming transparent salt-bricks used in constructing the bar. The food was both familiar in sharing some qualities with north Indian cuisine, but it also had a style of its own. I enjoyed the chicken pakoras and found them light and accompanied by a mild sweet chili sauce and a yoghurt sauce - perfect as an appetizer. The timing and the service, however, was disappointing. People have told me that time flows differently in Tibet, and based on our service, I'm now more than ever convinced this is true. Our waiter did not give us our appetizers all at once, which left me in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether to eat in front of my hungry friends, or let my food get cold, or, to divide up what I had among us. The waiter continued to be inattentive to the point where we all found him rude, despite his smiling face, and even after we sought him out to ask for the check, he continued to serve other tables for several minutes. We ended up being late for a concert because of this bad timing, which left us all unsatisfied. While we were waiting for the check I noticed scores of dirty glasses and plates that had piled up on the bar over the course of the evening (and not going back into the kitchen) which made me wonder about hygiene, while I also wondered if they were perhaps short staffed, or if this was their normal mode of operation. My momos (dumplings) were tasty, but I was left a little hungry afterward and would have gladly eaten a meal with a bit more on my plate.


 Perhaps it is in my good nature to give this restaurant another try, since I like the idea of Tibetan food, and much of the atmosphere was pleasant. I wonder if the poor service itself was an exception, and that uncertainty is enough to give it a second chance, but only in a situation where I have nowhere else to be after my meal."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2014-07-24,"Truly authentic, fresh and beautifully tasty Chinese food.

The eggplant is really good. Nice authentic Chinese food and great service. Oh, and you can get hot pot too! Just call ahead to book it :)"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,3,2017-02-26,"I tried a soup and the vegetarian dumplings - nothing to write home about, but the service was ok and nice."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-04-07,"Excellent and authentic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin. It's probably my favorite Chinese restaurant outside of China or Los Angeles. It is so good. I recommend the pork soup dumplings, pork belly, beef tripe, and jellyfish and cucumber. It's fun for me to read the menu in Chinese and German when my primary language is English. The wait staff speak it all so be comfortable ordering. I hope this restaurant stays in business forever. Perhaps they can open up a location in West Berlin too."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2016-11-01,"I don't like given Chinese restaurants bad reviews since I'm Chinese myself, but this place does not deserve 4.5 stars.  First of all they serve jasmine rice instead of traditional sticky rice. Also, the dumplings and tofu were the cheaper store bought kind.  I don't expect homemade tofu everywhere, but at least spend the extra 20 cents and buy the silken tofu for your mapo tofu.  I will say the waiter was very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,2,2016-06-08,"The food is nothing special at all. I guess the right word would be ""edible"". So, no reason to go. Also, that waitress sure was awkward and not very good."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-11-04,"Our group of four had an excellent meal here last week. Service was fine (by Berlin standards) and, more important, the menu was varied and the food tasted great--the spicy dishes were actually spicy (and not Germanized into blandness). We had the Qualle (quail egg) appetizer, Aubergine appetizer, and the boneless chicken in Szechuan chili oil sauce to start--all very good. For main courses, we had Gongbao chicken, lamb with coriander, and the pork belly (favorite of Chairman Mao, supposedly). All very tasty."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-08-02,This restaurant deserves more recognition. Very good food at decent price. Huge menu.
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2016-04-02,"The only reason I've given this restaurant 1 star is because the food is good. I'm not going to go into detail but if there's more than 2 people in the restaurant, don't bother. You could be waiting hours for your food. More attention is given to take-aways than guests VERY patiently waiting hours. And I do mean HOURS! Never again!!!!

UPDATE!!
Went there again! The restaurant looked pretty quiet so we went in to give it another chance. 
The food was typically good and there were 'TWO' pleasant waitresses BUT, as we waited and waited for our food, numerous take-out customers came in to collect food and at one point, most of the customers were Deliveroo and Foodora deliverers. Is this the way restaurants are going?
We were getting to the point of 'where's our food!!!' when it arrived. 

The Mayflower should downsize to being a take-away restaurant and save on rental space. It clearly gives take-out customers preference. Seriously. That WAS the last time!"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,1,2016-07-20,"This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot and sour soup was as sweet as ice cream, stank of vinegar and it was not spicy(hot) at all. The Gongbau chicken was mostly tiny bits of chicken and cabbage swimming in a sickening red-orange gloppy sauce, with perhaps three peanuts. It was not spicy. While Berlin can be a difficult city for Chinese cuisine, there are much, much better options. The owners should be ashamed: this is of such a low standard I can't comprehend how you could knowingly serve this food to customers. While I can see some other Yelpers have liked it, I wonder what their standards might be..."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-06-10,Most amazing Chinese restaurant with the best Sichuan cuisine I've experienced so far in Berlin!
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-11-22,"Still my all-time favourite Chinese food. The interior is modern but maintains a cozy, chinese-cantina kid of feel. The service is very friendly and speaks English (which is normal nowadays I know but I thought I?d mention it).
 The food is delicious everytime and ranges from honey spare rips to soft summer rolls. My personal favourites here however are the dumplings (because I like the word and also they taste great). They are traditional Chinese dumplings with a gourmet twist ( whitechicken or orangeprawns or blackbeef whatever you want) so you can`t go wrong. Anyway I?m heading there now because I got hungry writing this review, bye !"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-04-24,"I walked past this place a few times already and I always thought it looked neat. Now that I have been inside I know that the appearance did not fool me. :-P
The service was really friendly and every single dish we tried was amazing! Obviously you have to try any variety of their dumplings when you are here! :-)"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2017-09-11,"Come early to grab a seat.  This small little place has a great little cozy atmosphere, but even more important are the amazing dumplings.  We enjoyed the pork steamed dumplings and in fact placed a second order because they were too delicious to share.  The rest of the food we ordered like the peking pork was good, but nothing to write home about so that is why I only gave 4 stars.  Also the service was not the best.  They were friendly but rushed and had to flag them down several times to place an order for food and drinks."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,3,2017-07-01,"Overhyped and overpriced. The dumplings were okay, but nothing to write home about. The salmon was a disaster- overcooked, huge chunks of rock salt, underwhelming sauce and really for 8.50? it should have been at least twice the size. The best part of my 20? lunch was the house made lemonade, which was actually more of a light limeade spritz."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2017-07-08,"Quite yummy dumplings and cucumber slices salad! Came here for lunch with my meat-eating friends, not knowing if there would be anything for me. Luckily, I was happily surprised with delicious veggie dumplings. Sat outside with my puppy and enjoyed the view!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2017-10-13,Best Yumcha ever!! Get the baked Spring rolls. Quick friendly service. Excellent English but you must book! Saw so many people get turned away because every table was booked and it's only a small restaurant.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-07-08,"The dumplings were really amazing. My friends and I were feeling adventurous so we ordered many different kinds of dumplings. My personal favorite was the pink lamb. But I also loved the black beef and the orange prawn. They were super flavorful. The dumplings are big and very filled. Fat fat dumplings!! Just what I like. But the baked ones (which are fried) are kinda small.

I say skip the Shanghai dumplings -- no soup in a xiao long bao?! You may fool these Berliners but you can't fool me! I was Chinese in my past life. 

It's affordable but I kind of wish the dumplings were slightly cheaper so I could eat more of them!! For 10 euros you can eat 6 dumplings if you share with friends. I would certainly go back!!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2015-11-09,"I came here on a recommendation from a co-worker and was not disappointed.  The place is small but exudes a coolness factor. Located a short walk from Rosenthaler Platz underground on a quiet street it's easy to miss if you don't walk far enough down the street. Just walk past the Salumi place and you'll see it

I asked the waitress what amount of dumplings she recommended for 1 person. The waitress suggested I order 2 sets of dumplings so I tried the Prawn dumplings and the soup dumplings plus an order of edamame. 

The dumplings come in servings of 4 and are accompanied by 3 dipping sauces: a soy sauce-base one, a sweet one and a slightly spicier one. 

The Prawn dumplings were very good and the shrimp was not overcooked or mushy. The soup dumplings were very good too, however, they were not very soupy.  I would have preferred them with more broth inside the way they make them in New York's Chinatown. But the minced pork filling was flavorful. Two orders was definitely enough as I was stuffed so I am glad I didn't order more. They have a great selection of teas and juices here too. 

The service was quick and the waitress was friendly. Turns out she was from California so that explains the better than average service. I can't believe it took me this long to find this place. It ranks in my Top 10 and I will be coming back on my next work trip."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-06-19,"It' a small restaurant located at the conner on a street. The service was very nice and friendly. They greet us really well. Mother of dumpling was tasty, I really like it. Duck dumpling needs to change to beans dumpling because all I tasted was bean, just a little bit of duck meat inside. Beef Roll were to sour. 3 start for nice services and some good dumpling but others was not worth for its price."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-12-31,So good. Nothing else to add other than I wish I lived in Berlin so I could eat here everyday.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-08-12,"Those dumplings will make you think you just went to Chinese heaven.

Start with the black beef soup - it's black dumplings dipped in a sweet/spicy aromatic soup, which tastes even better once it mixes with the fillings. 

Shanghai dumplings are a classic, try all three different sauces that come with them.

For dessert, nougat dumplings work quite well - they come with delicious vanilla sauce!

For a claustrophobic Hong Kong experience try visiting the restroom."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2015-08-14,"Fantastic dumplings and fresh juices.

This restaurant is famous for they yummy dumplings. The rumour was correct: 5 star! 

We tired the vegetarian, orange shrimp and beef (rind). So much flavour, perfectly cooked. 
With this we drank four juices as they were hard not finish right away; DELICIOUS! 
(Only fruit!)
Watermelon+lychee
Cucumber, ginger, mint
Lychee, lime, soda 
Carrot, honey melon, honey

On top of this super cute and friendly staff, good outdoor tables and a very cool toilet!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-12-21,"The food is okay, but feels a bit uninspired; you could say it looks better than it tastes. A restaurant whose main selling point is the ambience rather than the menu."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,5,2016-11-01,"Good food, but great dumplings.  Friendly staff and a clean restaurant.  You'll leave with a happy belly. :)"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,3,2016-05-18,"Maybe I'm spoilt by all the great Asian food we have in New Zealand, but the food we had was pretty ordinary. I think ""Asian fusion"" can sometimes be used to describe something that isn't authentic, or good.

Prawn dumplings were ok, lamb dumplings were just a meatball wrapped in a thick pastry. 

It was ok, but not somewhere I would be raving to my friends about."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2016-04-16,"The place is very small so if you are more than two, you better get a reservation. 

Food is very good. Pretty fast and a lot of dishes. I would recommend to choose different combiantion and share them. Not all the Dumplings are the same size, even they are four per order. 

The menu comes in English for all of us who are not very fluent in German. 

Prices are not high and the service is very friendly specially for the host."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2014-08-04,"The dumplings are pretty good, but the servings are small. They always have a set menu for lunch special, and that was pretty good. They're not traditional Chinese dim sum, but I was intrigued and enjoyed the flavours for what it was. You probably will not fill yourself up here unless you're with friends, but the food is pretty good. It's hip and trendy, and there are tons of booths. I ate here alone, but they were still really accommodating to my needs.

I ordered a dumpling set with the soup dumplings, which were delicious and one of my first forays into the soup dumpling world. I also ordered the winter dumplings which were rich and a bit sweet. To top off my dumpling set, it also came with a soup, which was pretty good. The menu is simple, mostly based around the dumplings/dim sum. For a fast, quick lunch with good value, I'd go to Yumcha Heroes for the set menu. It's a relatively light meal (I think only three or four come in a set,) but it's affordable and has space for a lot of people, especially if youw ant to share. I didn't order any alcohol with my meal, but I did order one of those blooming teas which looked beautiful in a high glass."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,1,2015-09-30,"Waited 30min for dumplings! Dumpling itself was OK, however no spoon delivered for the soup
Unfortunately also no dogs allowed in the place, also not very charming staff"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,4,2012-07-24,"Yumcha Heroes! 

I mean, the name is just catchy, right? It is. Couple that with the kitschy little sign of two dumpling heroes high-fiving...and well, can you go wrong? You cannot. 

On a beautiful, gloriously sunny evening in Berlin I found myself perched just inside the patio at Yumcha awaiting my first Asian cuisine in Berlin aside from the sushi/Viet outpost in my supermarket.

I was pumped. DUMPLINGS. Let's do this. 

The restaurant was comfortably full...the patio pleasantly plump with patrons. Tables turn relatively fast because the food is pushed out with a nice clip. Good for me, as I was famished after a day of soaking in sunshine (finally!). 

An Aperol Spritz (or two) found me as well as the Shu Mai dumplings (pork, serving size =4 for about 3 euro). I also ordered the Jacob's Chicken, which was good but in hindsight I would've rather had a plate of steamed veggies and MORE dumplings. The dumplings are where its at, I do highly recommend. The silk cube tofu was also a hit, but I think next time soup, dumplings, more dumplings, veggies. That shall be my winning combo. 

Service was good despite being full, and pretty friendly. I noticed they do take credit cards (not sure if its just German bank cards though), but I'd bring cash just in case. 

Three drinks (eeps, school night!) plus dumplings and a main entree set me back approximately 35 euro. Not the cheapest (though the dumplings are), what really hit the bill was the 16 euro chicken...which wasn't even close to my favorite thing. 

So, lesson: go get the dumplings. 

YUMCHA HEROES! High five! 

*ps pro-tip, skip their desserts and head across the street for ice cream."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,?11-20,2,2016-01-31,"I don't know what has changed, but the dumplings we had last night tasted awful. If I were to guess, they used leftovers from yesterday (or even days ago). The ""steamed"" shrimp dumplings looked just like the ""pan fried"" version - both were very greasy and the dumpling wrap/dough was very chewy. It also had a very foul stench.

Months has gone by since we ate here and we liked the place, but we're no longer going to eat here. Seriously, there are a lot of other places popping up that's offering fresh, tasty, dim-sum."

Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,3,2017-10-11,"I was here earlier for dinner, and I must say I wasn't too impressed.

We were early enough to not stand up and wait for a table. We ordered noodle soups and some dim sum as well as pig ears. Nothing life altering. Slightly overhyped even, I must say. The noodles were just okay, and I had better noodles before. Perhaps I am biased with ramen, but the noodles here had a flat uni-dimensional taste. And the dim sum and pig ears were also just ordinary.

I know other Chinese places that have more interesting items on the menu. So I don't think I'd be back here again, unless this is the only open option.

Oh, the air circulation inside could be improved."

We had chicken soup, the combination dumplings, the house fried dumplings, and peanut sesame noodles. The soup was delicious and the star of the show -moist chicken and a flavorful Thai broth, the combination dumplings were good, but 5? for 4 small dumplings was steep. The house dumplings were very delicious -very flavorful. The price on these was a little better (10 dumplings for 8?) -but still quite expensive. The peanut sesame noodles were good -they were served a little tepid. I would've preferred them served hot, cold, or at least warm. Overall, the food was good, but expensive for the portions and I've had better. The customer service was great. We were seated and served quickly.

Although the Noodle House is facing the main steet, my partner and I did drove pass it. And have to check the house number to find the place. The shop is actually not so big. so better keep your eyes on their shop sign or the house number, if you on the way.

I have been looking forward to pay a visit for quite a long time, until recently finally got the chance for this. So as soon as we sat down, we were just looking for something nice from the meun. Of course, I ordered noodle soups with beef and fried noodle with beed as well. The soup one I think was alright. Probably, because I knew some other great noodle soup places. I really like the Fired noodle, it tasted very fine and delicated. Also we order XiaoLong Dao as side dish. it tasted good as well, but the potion was just small for us.

This place isn't self-service. It took a small while the staff came to us. The price of the place is great."

We also got xiaolongbao which was ok. The skins were a bit too thick but they arent a xiaolongbao ??? specialist so what we had was already acceptable. The dimsum combo (with hagaw ?? and siumai ??) was not that good though.

Heard about this place on vice channels ""chefs night out"" and since I'm obsessed with noodle soups, HAD to take a break from all the d?ner and come when I was visiting Berlin."

Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2017-01-18,A tiny place with usually long queue. But food is cheap and tasty. Their 'chilly oil dumpling' is must try.
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2016-04-09,"This was my 4th visit to Lon Men's and this time Dim Sum only. Nice sunny spring day and we were lucky to snatch a table outside. The duck bun should be listed as ""heavenly dream"". I had a foodgasm. Sure, this place is super busy because of the excellent food. I live in Neukoelln but happily trek on out to Charlottenburg, knowing I'm gonna be in heaven once again."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2016-06-04,"It is great Place for a fast meal. 
It's very small but all original handmade food. 
Everybody have to try this food."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2014-11-14,"As a Taiwanese-American, I was elated to find Taiwanese food in Berlin. I'm a pretty tough critic, but overall I enjoyed my experience at Lon-Men which brought me back to typical Taiwanese restaurants in California or Taiwan.

Starting from the best, the beef noodle soup was very good, lots of heat (you'll be sweating), with tender beef, the noodles were a bit flimsy for me but that could be personal preference. The pork chop with dry noodles were good, chili oil wontons just ok IMHO (I have a high standard, few places ever get it right), and gua bao was disappointing, lacking on filling and flavors (go to Street Food Thursday/Bao Kitchen).

Despite my criticisms, I will definitely go back to try more dishes, I'm still just happy I can find Taiwanese food in Berlin! Plus the staff is friendly :)"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,4,2016-06-14,"I was in town for two weeks on a solo trip and this joint was one of the few Chinese / Taiwanese places that seemed noteworthy, especially given that they actually sell ???. That said, I was slightly miffed that their ??? seemed to follow the Mainland tradition of the dish; I was pretty hyped up about the prospect of eating a Taiwanese-styled ???. The ??? was okay, but overall the place is priced really well. If you're feeling like you want some good Chinese food while in Berlin, be sure to stop by!"
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2015-11-06,"I had never had been one for soups for dinner and was quite skeptical about it, but with the more than pleasant reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try. Thank GOD I did. This was wonderful. The waiters are wonderful and helpful. And the noodle soup with crispy duck was phenomenal. Also the dim sum was clearly made by the gods."
Lon Men?s Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under ?10,5,2015-10-29,"What is better than a bowl of piping hot soup noodle on a chilly autumn day? Nothing, that's what! Pair it with some pot stickers or steamed dumplings and my life is completed. This hole-in-the-wall place has truly authentic Taiwanese soup noodle and dumplings. Everything we had was delicious. The owner was super nice too. It can get a little crowded at lunch time, thou, but that all add to the experience I think. I felt like I was in a Taiwanese night market noodle shop. :D"
