NUR Gem?se-Kebap,2,Among the bottom 20% of D?ners I've had. Don't know where the hype comes from.,0,1
Juki,2,"The service was far from good, had to ask few times to get extra salad and drinks. Chicken was tasteless, entrec?te (the most expensive thing in the menu) served frozen! At the end we still were hungry, which is rare when you're dining in Berlin.On the positive side is grilling on your own table, which is superfun.",0,1
Yam Yam,1,"All the vegetarian dishes aren't vegetarian. There is always chicken in the broth or fish sauce in the dish. That is criminal, don't go there!",0,1
Arirang Bulgogi,2,"I cannot say I was impressed here. I was here the other night with a friend, and we were looking for dinner. We ordered two dolsot bibimbaps, as well as a plate of steamed dumplings to share. It was great that they had these little plates of appetizers, which is typical of Korean food. The bibimbap had somehow more rice than vegetables and meat. I definitely had better bibimbap in other places.But the most shocking thing of all was the dumplings. When we took a bite, it was still frozen inside. We sent it back. It came back after a few minutes, slightly better, but of course, first impressions count.There aren't a lot of choices in this neighborhood, but after my first experience, I definitely would want to search somewhere else before even thinking of going back here.",0,1
Bocca di Bacco,1,"Don't get fooled by the beauty of the building ... this place is a scam.Super pricey for low quality food.Seriously... we got some dodgy fried spring onions on top of our meal, felt like shredded plastic bags: impossible to eat.Mozzarella is tiny and tasteless.Presentation is cheap.Decoration is kinda tasteless.You will pay around 100 euros for 2, for a bad Italian meal in a pompous restaurant.You could pay half in some simple trattoria for an amazing meal in a nice atmosphere.",0,1
Espanol Don Quijote,1,"Visited the restaurant with a friend couple who recommended it and said the food was always great.Must have been an off night, because even my friends were disappointed. I can only talk about the experience me and my partner had.The restaurant itself is nice and the hostess was really friendly. The menu looked pretty good too. I ordered calamari and my partner salmon. Both portions were huge disappointments, both looked weird, even repulsive. The calamari was swimming in brown goo, the salmon hidden under brown stuff, mostly nuts. The only taste in the calamari portion was of salt and chili. The salmon was tasteless.As said, this may well have been an off-night, but by the experience I had I can not recommend the place nor do I have any interest to give it a second try. There are just too many decent restaurants in the city, that do not disappoint.",0,1
Thai-Elephant,2,Food came out fast but it took forever to get the check. Maybe it was an off night? Green curry duck and beef basil were both good.,0,1
PHO - Noodlebar,2,"Yes it was tasty but it was a really small portion- like a small pho for the price of a large pho 8,5?. Normally it's like 6? and this is a small portion. In combination with long waiting time - skip it.",0,1
Fes - Turkish BBQ,2,"We have dropped by several times in the past hoping to get a walk-in table unsuccessfully, so this time we booked a table for Sunday evening. The restaurant was full, as usual. A glance at the customer demographic was very revealing. By simply setting a grill into each table, they seem to have captured the imagination of a certain group. But does it work....?It's an expensive experience compared to other Turkish grill options and I think that a price indicator of ??? would be more accurate than ??. Our bill for two included 6 mezes and 2 meat dishes washed down with five beers  and came  to ?75.Down to the food. It can't be denied that the Meze are good, perhaps very good. But we agreed that the meat was unexceptional. You cook it yourself on an electric grill set in the table. It therefore lacks any of the flavour normally imparted by a traditional Turkish charcoal grill. All of the meat, which was not of the best quality, was heavily marinated in order to impart flavour and to my mind this concept did not work.In order for a Turkish Grill House to work, you need the skills of a seasoned grillmaster cooking on a good open grill.I really don't think I would return, although Turkish friends have spoken well of it.",0,1
Mabuhay,5,"We landed in Berlin, tired and hungry. We were staying at a hotel nearby and came here for dinner, assuming they take credit card. We had a great meal and in the middle we realize to ask if they take credit card, and it turns out they do not - cash only. But the owner was very friendly with us and told us we can just pay him back another day, and he said so with a smile on his face. It was such a warm welcome to his city of Berlin. We did have dollars since we were coming from the United States, and he said no problem pay in dollars or come back another day with euros. He was very kind and genuine and it gave us positive energy. Pretty memorable. We ended up paying in dollars. The food by the way was delicious and really really reasonably priced for the quality.",1,0
